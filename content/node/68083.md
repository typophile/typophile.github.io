  Adobe fixed the mistake with version 1.001.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any similar

  body: 'Early versions of ITC Eras from Adobe included two versions: One for low
    resolution (300dpi) devices and one for higher resolution. The "low-res" version
    was upright. I don''t have anything but my memory to back this up. It was something
    I learned during a visit to a service bureau in the early DTP days. Adobe''s Optima
    had a similar "low-res" and "hi-res" version.'

  body: "IIRC, it wasn't an error but a decision motivated by the difficulties involved
    in rasterizing a stroke that deviates from the vertical by a small angle. At the
    time, laser printers were 300 dpi, and screen resolution was coarse of course.\r\n\r\nAnother
    interesting issue was that because Eras only has four letters, some software applications
    didn't recognize it in the \"font name field\", as they were set up to register
    no fewer than five letters!\r\n\r\nIIRC, there were also some straightened out
    versions of Optima. Again, not an error, but a liberty taken, occasioned by lower
    resolution technology.\r\n\r\nI could go on, to discuss the \"error\" of turning
    metal types that were optically scaled into single-master digital typefaces.\r\nSlanted
    italics.\r\nAuto-tracing.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Nick.\r\n\r\nWe all know Paul Renner never intended for Futura to
    have crashing ascenders and descenders, either (the font was originally cast on
    a larger body to prevent this), yet that (error?) has persisted since the introduction
    of phototypesetting.\r\n\r\nDon't get me started on italics styled italic, i.e.,
    Perpetua Italic, originally designed by Gill to have an 8\xB0 slant, styled italic
    at 12\xB0 equals an abomination at 20\xB0! (Let's not get into Gill's personal
    abominations.)"
