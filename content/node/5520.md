body: I realize that there is not likely to be a digital font which actually matches
  this old street sign, but I wanted to see if anyone recognized it and/or had some
  suggestions for fonts that would be close. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40109.jpg"

  body: It reminds me of a number of Red Rooser fonts, like Yeoman, Sycamore, Silverado
    Condensed, Schiller Antiqua, Helium, Equestrienne and Coliseum. These are all
    monotone serif fonts &#40;or close to it&#41;, and they are all found at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/redrooster/"
