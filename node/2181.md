  body: 'I think my Armenian stuff doesn&#39;t apply because there&#39;s only one
    language that uses the Armenian script... And my Latin stuff isn&#39;t that &#34;sensitive&#34;,
    yet... And fonts like Gentium that are so multi-purpose they can&#39;t really
    exhibit what you&#39;re looking for. So I think what you need is fonts that are
    Latin but are focused on one single language besides English - like one of those
    Morisawa winners? <BR> <BR>BTW, you should check this out: <BR><a href="http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/volume6/issue1/ep075lmf.pdf"
