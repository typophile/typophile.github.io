    target="_blank">Garage Gothic</a>, <BR>although on second look, yours is different
    enough. <BR> <BR>Is the cyrillic here part of your face? I&#39;d love to see more.

  body: 'I would make optical adjustments to the horizontals &#40;they should slightly
    thinner <BR>than the verticals&#41; this would improve <BR>legibility. Also D
    seems too heavy around <BR>the curves on the left. I do not think the S <BR>fits
    with the rest of the glyphs. For additional <BR>reference of similar designs,
    see Mark Von Bronkhorst&#39;s Conduit <BR>&#40;itcfonts.com or mvbfonts.com&#41;
    <BR>A good start...Keep it going... '

    this case I'm thinking that maybe the optical\r\nna\xEFvet\xE9 is the main way
    this design might differentiate itself from the masses.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
