    I do like your quotation marks.  '

  body: Woah. Very interesting. I see <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Stage/7535/gorey.html"
    target="_blank">Edward Gorey</a>, but this says a lot about me. I&#39;d like to
    see this one larger too. What if you reversed the scale on the ampersand?

  body: Wow, that Edward Gorey stuff is creepy, and it makes this typeface look even
    more creepy than it already did.  Interesting spin on dreamlike states
