  The inscription on the logo will be Dietetika.\r\n\r\nAny help would be apprecciated

  body: The really smart thing would be to get a local designer to do it for you.
    But if you're too much like me, try Ralf Hoffmeister's superficial. It's a contemporary
    sans-serif.

  body: "Could you tell us more about what kind of customers they have, and what kind
    they would like?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Ralf Hoffmeister's superficial</blockquote>\r\n\r\nTry
    to avoid free fonts - you usually end up paying in other ways...\r\n\r\nCase in
    point: among other problems, Superficial is very poorly spaced, which means you
    either have to spend a lot of time fixing it, or it will look like your client's
    customers are very clumsy people.  :-)\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm getting a nagging feeling
    that it's a swipe-n-hack job, meaning it was based on somebody else's -possibly
    commercial- font. Looking at Hoffmeister's only other font* my suspicions are
    doubled. Please don't support theft.\r\n\r\n* http://26plus-zeichen.de/fonts/winheim/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thank you for your suggestions..   The site is a magazine, regarding nutrition,
    health and physical activity, but is not in english.. I am still working on it,
    but will try today to put some dummy content and link it. I tried some fonts,
    but not really satisfied.. Thanks hrent, I understant that.. I tried the superficial
    font, just to see how it looks like.. The headers on the site are Open Sans Condensed
    in uppercase, the same green color as the fonts..\r\nAny comment is apprecciated
