body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nI was just curious to find out what you guys thought of my latest
  website design.\r\n\r\nIt's essentially a charity organisation that seeks new families
  for foster children.\r\n\r\nI didn't design the logo myself. It was provided by
  the client.\r\n\r\nBlue and yellow are the corporate colours. They also asked me
  to use black and white photos exclusively, in accordance with their corporate ID.\r\n\r\nAs
  for the fonts, I will probably have to stick to Georgia since this is the only serif
  font that looks good across browsers.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for any feedback!"

  body: "I like the simplicity of this (and the little head illustration in the logo!).
    Three quick thoughts:\r\n\r\n(1) The donation button is a little too far down
    the page for a charity, IMO.\r\n(2) I'm a little confused about the function of
    the vertical menu. How is it different than the function of the main horizontal
    menu? Or is it related to the image to the left?\r\n(3) I feel like there's too
    much grey on the page (so not enough color). "

  body: "Hello Dan,\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback.\r\n\r\n(1) OK, you are probably
    right. I adjusted it a little.\r\n(2) The vertical menu is meant to act as a secondary
    navigation in this case. It may contain zero to ten or so navigation points.\r\n(3)
    I totally agree. The grey didn't feel right. I replaced it with blue now. How
    do you like it? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/layout2_3731.jpg]"
