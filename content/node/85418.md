  and I am trying to get rid of duplicate fonts. I have Avenir and Avenir LT Std as
  open type fonts.\r\nMy question is which one is better to keep, and what is the
  difference between the two?\r\nI know I'm going to have the same problem when I
  get to Helvetica. I have searched online with no luck so far. Thank you for any
  advice given.\r\n"

    answer.\r\n\r\n'Avenir LT Std' is most likely Adobe's version (which is also sold
    by Linotype among others). 'Avenir' could be from anyone. What does the font's
    copyright information indicate?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    as follows:\r\nCopyright \xA9 1989, 1995, 2002 Adobe Systems Incorporated.  All
    Rights Reserved. \xA9 1981, 1995, 2002 Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. All rights

    of Linotype-Hell AG and/or its subsidiaries.\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask which is
    better to use is because some designer friends of mine have said that the LT Std
    version of some fonts has strange spacing.\r\nI dont really know what the difference
    is supposed to be, if any.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time."

  body: "I would assume that 'Avenir' is simply a conversion to OpenType of Adobe's
    Type 1 version of Avenir since AFAIK all of their fonts had 'Std' appended to
    the name when they released their library in OpenType format.\r\n\r\nSome of the
    Standard versions might have had spacing problems introduced, but then some of
    the standard versions might also have corrected spacing problems which were present
    in the earlier versions. I don't think you can make any inferences based solely
    on the fact that 'Std' is appended -- this is simply what Adobe uses to designate
    OpenType fonts which have standard Western European Character sets (as opposed
    to Pro fonts which also include Central European as well as Cyrillic and Greek
    in some cases).\r\n\r\nBasically, if you want to choose one version over the other
    you'll simply have to experiment and see which offers the better quality. And
    of course there's no reason why you can't keep both if in doubt. After all, if
    you get rid of either, you're going to run into problems with any existing documents
    which use that font.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
