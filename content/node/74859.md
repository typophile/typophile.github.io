  body: 'As you suggested, I also think it''s a custom job based on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica-neue/helveticaneue-bold/|Helvetica
    Neue Bold]] (mainly because of the g''s loop and counter design), not so hard
    reproduce: A''s crossbar removed, n''s shoulder filled, v horizontally mirrored,
    l and o unchanged and smae treatment for g as n.'
