    <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptSmall/BritchesScr.gif\">Britches Script</a>
    caps, from Panache, seem to match the letters if you squoosh them a bit. This
    seems to suggest that this lettering is derived from some of the many hand-lettered
    film types in the pre-digital era.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "If you look at pages 88-90 in the good ol' Solotype Catalog, you can see
    just a bit of the range of hand-drawn type that was available. The Photo-Lettering
    catalogs are full of more of them. Panache and URW are two studios that have digitized
    more of these than most, although I think these typefaces (many by Ed Benguiat)
    are a rich resource that many have 'mined' over the years.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Possibly, in the sense that looking truly hand-printed is more 'now' than
    in the days when lettering was done by pros whose hand-lettering looked too good
    to be hand-drawn.\r\n\r\nThis has a casual feel that seems almost more like pencil
    or chalk than a pen or brush. The way the strokes end heightens that effect.\r\n\r\nOnce
    again we are back in the realm of hand-printed fonts (= cheap & easy to make)
    and so anyone with experience in hand-lettering could have created this font.\r\n\r\nThe
    next question it makes you ask is 'aren't there a lot of fonts that are enough
    like this that I wouldn't be able to tell them from this one without looking at
    them side-by-side?' I think the answer to that one is 'yes'. \r\n\r\nMike's Rule
    of Hand-lettered fonts: If it's too much trouble to find the exact match, pick
    a close equivalent, and get on with it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
