body: Ah, the curse seems to be lifted for Boston, once again.  For all who searched
  in futilily like I had to find a decent Boston Red Sox font, just as Boston fans
  had waited in hope for a world championship... both are finally a reality. <BR>
  <BR>DaFont has just released <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nq=1&amp;q=bosox"
  target="_blank">Lee Gordon&#39;s BoSox</a>, which is much cleaner and sharper than
  <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nq=1&amp;q=dirty+sox" target="_blank">Dirty
  Sox</a>, the old alternative, though still not quite as polished as <a href="http://ortiz-lopez.com/OLP06.html"
  target="_blank">Ortiz-Lopez&#39;s Red Sox</a> font.
