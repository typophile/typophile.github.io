  about the origin of the &#34;two spaces after a period&#34; rule I learned in typing
  class, and unlearned in a design class. What&#39;s the deal with that? Where&#39;d
  it originate? Why do people <i>still</i> do it?

  body: The extra space, on a typewriter, is typographically functional in that it
    reduces the incidence of &#34;divorcees&#34;. That&#39;s the situation where you
    get the first word of a sentence, often &#34;A&#34; or &#34;The&#34; at the end
    of a line -- which is something that I manually fix in rag right text, and in
    Web text by using a &#34;nbsp&#34; after the article when it is followed by a
    capitalized name &#40;if I remember&#41;.  <BR> <BR>However, a better explanation
    is that the widths of the points in a monospaced font are hugely wider, relatively
    speaking, than in a proportional font. So that the character sequence &#34;comma-space-lowercase&#34;
    within a sentence really splits it, visually, and is much closer in status, as
    a visual marker, to the sequence &#34;period-space-capital&#34; that denotes a
    new sentence, than in a proportional font. A double space compensates and puts
    back the degree of distinction.

  body: William, as far as I know, the term &#34;thin space&#34; does not have an
    absolute, universally accepted dimension &#40;despite what Mr. Felici states&#41;.
    I&#39;ve seen it just as often defined as M/5, or even M/6, as I have M/4. I haven&#39;t
    been able to identify if it had a specific defined value in the context of Linotype
    typesetting. <BR> <BR>Also, in Linotype setting &#40;and also hand composition,
    for that matter&#41; the spaceband is not part of a font of type. Lino spacebands
    go in a separate holding area of the machine and get inserted through a different
    mechanism than the characters of a font.  <BR> <BR>The Linotype spaceband is a
    long, tapered piece; this taper is what allows the line to be justified and all
    the word spaces adjusted evenly to fill out the line. The thin top end of the
    taper defines your minimum word space; the thickness at the bottom end defines
    the maximum. I believe you could order Linotype spacebands of different minimum
    widths &#40;and possibly even different tapers&#41;. <BR> <BR>Adding a thin space
    &#40;however defined&#41; after an end-of-sentence spaceband would ensure that
    this word space was wider. But that statement about approximating an &#42;em&#42;
    space doesn&#39;t make sense. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: I thought that was odd, too. The book is presumably set using this spaceband
    &#43; thin space method and the lines are justified right and left. On somewhat
    loose lines it does look like about an em &#40;all the paragraphs appear to be
    indented an em&#41;. It may be that it looks wider because of the space above
    the period. <BR> <BR>In any case, there is no explanation that I can find in the
    book either about why it&#39;s a good idea to have that much space between sentences
    or why a spaceband &#43; a thin space is aproximately an em. <BR> <BR>&#40;Perusing
    the book, it strikes me that the Linotype was a hideously complex machine to operate.
    You could actually damage the machine by setting too little space between words!&#41;

    machine. <BR> <BR>Linotype aside, in metal type days it was split school on the
    matter of an extra space folowing a period in text. My ITU lesson books stated
    that it was a house style. In some shops it was prefereed in others it was not.  <BR>
    <BR>At one time I followed the notion that a thin space added was the thing to
    do, just becuase that was the style at JW Boyd &amp; Sons. Now it jangles me to
    see an added space. To my eye, the white space above the period goves all the
    break needed. On the Monotype and in hand composition, I will drop even the word
    space if the next sentence starts with a cap T &#40;on tight lines&#41;, and use
    only a thin space on more open spaced lines. <BR> <BR>Mark: You could indeed damage
    things on the Linotype or the Intertype with tight lines. The damage was usually
    confined to bending the tails on the space bands when they were forced upwards
    to spread the line. The fewer spacebands there were in the line, the more likely
    the bands were to be bent. Another resultof tight lines was the mangling of the
    ears on the matrices, whose function was to assure alignment of the characters.
    <BR> <BR>Very loose lines caused the slow buildup of typemetal on the sides of
    the mats at he casting point. The result was that  molten metal was allowed to
    flow between the loosely packed matrices and &#34;hairlines&#34; or fins developed
    between each letter. The longer these mats were kept in service the worse it got.
    <BR> <BR>Take a look at the columns of text in any old hotmetal-produced newspaper,

    machines which was used to drive out the side walls of the hairlined mats so that

    a sentence to 66% over a word space alone. If however the word space is 1/2 em,

    The same is true of wide settings on a Linotype. The extra space after a period
    however has nothing to do with that. Or, at least, was incidental to setting technology.
    <BR> <BR>Jim and I have both indicated the extra  space after a period is a matter
    of &#34;house style&#34;. My words were, a &#34;bad fad&#34;. And yes, certainly
    Monotype machines had some bad fad artists tapping keys. <BR> <BR>But for sure,
    dreadful typography could be set by hand, set by Linotype or set by Monotype.
    Just the same as in digital typography. Machines do not set type, people do. <BR>
    <BR>Very tight spacing was possible with a Monotype, but not necessarily. Also
    it did not cause fins on a Monotype. Not the kind you see on the printed page.
    <BR> <BR>The operator had exceptional control over setting text. Both variable
    and fixed spaces were available. Micro fine increments combined with the ability
    to unit add and unit subtract gave the operator the ability to do an exceptional
    setting. <BR> <BR>The ability to unit subtract meant you could easily kern on
    a Monotype. Not so easily by hand setting. Hand setting was a matter of very fine
    hack saws, gravures, and files. Great care had to be made in that operation or
    characters could lean, or work upwards and become bolder. However good craftsmanship
    is a wonderful tool. <BR> <BR>That particular difficulty was not a problem with
    Monotype kerning. <BR> <BR>But all this depends on the knowledge and skills of
    the operator and the &#34;nature of the craftsman&#34;. <BR> <BR>But certainly,
    a slovenly mess can be made using any typesetting technology. And one way to be
    slovenly is to subscribe to adding an extra space after the period. <BR> <BR>There

    correspondence is usually full of these things, and therefore scattered with full
    points that do not mark the end of sentences. Perhaps a little extra space was
    thought useful to prevent confusion where the full point was being used to do
    its real job? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think this can be the origin of the practice
    &#40;because it is obviously present in 19th century books, where my explanation

    its use with monospaced typewritten business correspondence. <BR> <BR>A separate
    question: in earlier printing it was also customary to put a little extra space

    Because they rise above the baseline, I do sometimes feel that these marks are
    set a bit too close against their preceding text in some fonts at least at small
    sizes and affect legibility. I&#39;m inclined to think it might sometimes be justifiable,
    since Finer Points &#40;otherwise a great enemy of excessive space&#41; reckons
    that a hair space might be justified in some such cases. I&#39;m talking about
    a really fractional space, here, around 1/12 em at most, and I&#39;m sure it depends

  body: 'William <BR> <BR>I think Gerald and Kent have probably answered most of your
    questions about spacing on the Linotype and Monotype. <BR> <BR>Let me add this:
    <BR> <BR>There is not really a typical word space on the Monotype any more than
    there is on the computer in the setting of justified text matter &#40;a book for
    example&#41; since the word space spreads or pulls in at the command of the person
    on the keyboard. I suppose setting the H&amp;J&#39;s on a Mac allows one to have
    very tight or very loose ranges of spacing. <BR> <BR>On the Linotype, as has been
    mentioned, the spacebands &#40;long, thin wedge devices&#41; have a minimum width
    when they are not given the opportunity to be pushed upward by the spaceband bar
    to spread the line out to fill the measure. If an operator left a lot of space
    at the end of a line, and there were only five or six spacebands in the line,
    there would be a greater amount added to each word space than if there were ten
    spacebands and the same amount of space at the end of the line. Whatever is left
    over when the operator of the Lino sent the line in for casting, is spread out
    by the spacebands. The same sort of thing happens on the Monotype Keyboard when
    the operator decides that the line just keyed in is complete.  <BR> <BR>An operator
    wishing to set with tight word spacing on the Monotype would be conscientious
    in fitting the line as tightly as possible before punching in the justification
    codes on the tape. In either the case of the Mono or the Lino, the result is the
    same. <BR> <BR>Regarding the fixed spaces available on the Linotype: in addition
    to the regular spacebands, there are also available narrower spacebands that will
    give much tighter wordspacing. I am not aware if there are any other than the
    two widths. In the case of large type setting on the Linotype, say 18 point to
    48 pt, the operator needed to add a correct amount of fixed thin spaces to each
    spaceband to avoid too skinny a word space. The linotype has fixed Mut, nut and
    thin spaces in the magazine, available at the stroke of a key. In addition there
    are  brass and steel thin spaces which the operator places by hand throughout
    the line of matrices in that have been dropped into the assembler box of the machine
    by the operator&#39;s keystrokes. After the line is cast, these very thin spaces
    are retrieved again by hand by the operator before the line is sent off to be
    distributed into the magazine. <BR> <BR>The Monotype &#40;in addition to the flexible
    wordspace used in justified setting&#41; has the following fixed spaces: Em&#40;18
    unit&#41;, 12 unit, 10 unit, nut &#40;9 unit&#41;,  8 unit, 6 unit and five unit.
    <BR>By a magical manouevre by the operator it is possible to have access thinspacing
    as small as 2 units. This is a trick I have never been able to muster up the ambition
    to use. I did fall upon it accidentally once about 20 years ago, but have forgotten
    how it works. Too lazy to read the manual. I know Gerald Giampa is a whiz at the
    practice of thinspacing with the green justification key. This is a handy thing
    to have in the thinspacing of small cap lead-ins and in very tight lines where
    one needs less than a five unit space.  <BR> <BR>Summing it up: the Linotype justifies
    by a strightforward mechanical process of wedging out the spaces between two pre-set
    steel jaws &#40;the mold vise&#41;. The Monotype counts off every unit struck
    by the operator as each character or space is struck. When you are at what you
    feel is the end of a line, you are shown how many units are left in the line for
    the spaces to take up un a revolving mathematical drum. In that regard, the Monotype
    works in exactly the same way as the computer, in that what has been keyed is
    computed and resolved. Or more precisely, the computer works in the same way as
    the Monotype. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, there is a man in California by the name
    of Bruce Wasbish who has done marvelous bookwork using the Linotype. He once told
    me that it is possible to do fine books on the Linotype &#34;but it is excruciating&#34;.

  body: 'Jim , great explanation of Mono and Lino justification above. I wonder, however,
    how much sense any written explanation can make in the absence of seeing a machine
    in operation, unfortunately. I don&#39;t know that I would have really followed
    the Mono explanation if you hadn&#39;t shown me last year. <BR> <BR>Maybe at TypeCon
    this summer, we can plan a field trip  to Arion, or someplace like that, where
    interested folks can see machines in operation. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Really? I&#39;m
    all for letting users change the word spacing, but simply ignoring the &#34;default&#34;
    space that a type designer has &#40;nominally&#41; so carefully determined seems
    harmful. </i> <BR> <BR>I think &#34;nominally&#34; is the key here. Hrant, you
    realize I&#39;m talking about &#42;me&#42;, not the average user &#40;remember,
    I&#39;m an elitist ;-&#41; And I&#39;m talking strictly about justified settings.
    <BR> <BR>The main reason for my comment is this: In justified setting, the default
    space built into the font is largely moot. It will almost never actually occur;
    the space is constantly variable. I think the spacing parameters are better driven
    by the type size and the line length and the leading. <BR> <BR>I prefer time-honored
    standards &#40;at least as a starting point&#41; and generally like to have optimum
    spacing of M/4 or M/5, minimum of M/5 or M/6, and maximum of M/3.  <BR> <BR>However,
    these values cannot be entered directly. H&amp;Js in Quark and InDesign are percentages
    of the font&#39;s space value. So I have to determine the value of the space in
    order to know how to set my H&amp;Js. For instance with Stempel Garamond, whose
    space value is 250, I might use 80/100/133. But for Bembo, whose space is 278,
    I will need to use 72/90/120 to get the same spacing.  <BR> <BR>Very inconvenient.
    <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Does the Quark default affect letter spacing as well? &#40;I
    have InDesign&#41;</i> <BR> <BR>Quark&#39;s defaults are 80/110/250 word spacing,
    0/0/4 letter spacing. Notice the optimum word space is 110% of the font&#39;s
    space -- how idiotic. When the line cannot be acceptably hyphenated to run at
    optimum or tighter down to the minimum, then Quark runs out the line. After stretching
    the space to 250%, it will start letterspacing up to 4% wider -- even more egregious
    than excessive word-spacing! <BR> <BR>&#40;I don&#39;t fully understand the intricacies
    of Quark&#39;s specific algorithm, so the above is a generalization regarding
    when it applies which decisions between hyphenation and justification. But the
    results can be atrocious, regardless.&#41; <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t recall Indy&#39;s
    defaults off hand. But they are undoubtedly better. Plus, the multi-line composer
    can make better overall &#34;decisions&#34;. But these are still not beyond contesting,
    in my limited experience with Indy. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Kent, why do you oppose the
    bigger spaces? And if they are to be varied at the discression of the person setting
    the type, what considerations would lead to a bigger or smaller word space? </i>
    <BR> <BR>William, the case for close fitting has been made by Dowding and Bringhurst.
    I won&#39;t repeat them here. I remember not accepting everything by either man
    at face value &#40;it&#39;s been a while since I read either&#41;, but I largely
    agree on this general point.  <BR> <BR>For me the bottom line is cohesion of the
    line and minimizing vertical drift across lines. The closer word spacing comes
    to the interlinear spacing, the less cohesion the line has and the more easily
    drift occurs. Acceptable word spacing is closely related to leading, line length,
    and margins.  <BR> <BR>The minimum is a function of the openness and internal
    fitting of the font -- a wide, open design or a loosely fit font will not tolerate
    as tight a minimum.  <BR> <BR>I won&#39;t go on about this. I have work to get
    back to. Meet me at TypeCon and ply me with sufficient food or drink and I will
    happily talk your ear off. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>Actually Nick. It was not abandoned. Very few used it. It was always
    an option.  <BR> <BR>There were two ways to achieve incremental additions, or
    subtractions to the width of type. One had nothing intended to do with <i>word</i>
    spacing. <BR> <BR>Using a larger wedge for a more open fit, or a smaller wedge
    for just the opposite. Not too much smaller or mechanical problems would show.
    Bruce Rogers used this feature for special book projects. <BR> <BR>Then you had
    unit adding, or unit subtracting. Monotypes were incredibly flexible. That does
    not mean all features were recommended practice for every job. Many operators
    never knew of their existence. Many others just never bothered with them. <BR>
    <BR>That said, I never remember too many operators habitually using unit adding
    or subtracting except on problematical settings.  <BR> <BR>A good use for unit
    subtracting is kerning. A problem readily solved with a Monotype. <BR> <BR>Unit
    adding would be used in instances where the operator was stuck with a sequence
    of unfortunate word breaks. But still, the discriminating operator would first
    search for a judicious use of unit subtracting often improving the setting of
    a line.  <BR> <BR>Unless an unfortunate line length was forced upon the operator
    unit adding would be a very rare thing, except when all of a sudden the author
    of the text decides to go on a name dropping spree. Maybe rewrite the text or
    cause the author to suddenly loose his friends. Don&#39;t look at me. <BR> <BR>The

    <BR>This is obviously true. In my experience with setting, the person setting
    the type must strive to come as close as possible to the most desireable space
    value. In good texwork this is generally thought to be a mid space &#40;4 to the
    em space&#41;.  The use of hyphenation makes this task easier to accomplish. Those
    persons who hate to see a hyphen in text must have a tough time. I would strive
    for even colour in spacing with the use of hyphenation, than resorting to some
    of the moves people use today. One that I really cannot abide is the practice
    of messing fit the overall fit of the type to cram a line in or to fatten one
    out. Now this is just a personal preference, but I would much more end up with
    a baggy line spacing-wise than to see some lines stand out as black bars, and
    others as lighter lines.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know how far one can go with the
    adding of space between letters in a line, but for me it would have to be very

    <BR>If the type characters are constant within themselves, you can not do that,

    <BR> <BR>That said, present typography uses rubber type every day. I hate that.
    I agree with you, and disagree with Tolbert Lanston on that issue. That is, if
    indeed, he was ever so optimistic about such a bad idea. <BR> <BR>But notice,
    Tolbert Lanston found reason against this idea. But applications such as Adobe
    PageMaker, or InDesign are rather stubbornly wrong. Some of their customers are
    also. I remember this discussion in the typophile forum. <BR> <BR>Still I am not
    convinced that the Monotype Recorder has accurately stated this. Tolbert may have
    been describing a &#34;feature&#34; and not advocating a &#34;radical change&#34;.
    Remember that proper nouns do cause a problem. For some reason unknown to me,
    proper nouns should not be broken. I say, &#34;go ahead, break them.&#34; <BR>
    <BR>Although, I don&#39;t. <BR> <BR>A tool frequently used by typographical experts,
    was the ampersand. The ampersand was one of the typesetters best friends. Unfortunately,
    today&#39;s typesetters do not treat their friends well these days. The ampersand
    has had its&#39; feelings hurt and has gone away. <BR> <BR>When is the last time
    you attempted to use the ampersand in a text. I mean in a legitimate fashion?
    Try it, very disappointing. That&#39;s rubber for you. <BR> <BR>Rubber type is
    not a &#34;feature&#34;, it is a &#34;fault&#34;. I am not saying it should never
    be used. I am saying it should not &#34;have to be used&#34;. There should be

    of Dowding and chew on all this before coming back to the issue. Meanwhile here
    is some more grist for the mill from Erik Spiekermann&#39;s <a href="http://www.spiekermann.com"
    target="_blank">blog</a>: <BR> <BR>&#34;Text is usually set too tightly and with
    too big a wordspace. One of the legacies of Quark Xpress. Always set the optimum
    wordspace &#40;under H&amp;J&#41; to 80% or less in unjustified setting. And increase
    tracking by at least 2 units &#40;that'

    a school magazine to the client, the one I mentioned above. I told her about the
    double spacing no-no, and that I had fixed them to a single. She remarked that
    the double spacing was what she was taught in secretary school back in the day,
    smiled, and said that she thought I was right. What a lovely client.  <BR> <BR>kris.

    bad advice.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s hard to believe that Erik knows better than all
    those other type designers, who &#40;one would assume&#41; work on the assumption
    that people will be using their fonts with the built-in space width, at 100%,
    and proportion it accordingly. <BR> <BR>If I thought people would actually heed
    Erik&#39;s advice, I would pre-emptively increase the width of the spaces in my
    fonts. Pretty soon there would be a cold war &#40;a space race&#41;, with the  spaces  in  fonts  getting  bigger  and
    bigger,    and    Erik&#39;s    recommended optimum     getting      smaller       and        smaller.

    <BR>First, give it a value that looks about right in the metrics window. <BR>Than,
    after a font has been generated, test it in a Quark document. If the space doesn&#39;t
    look right there, I can vary its horizontal scaling in Quark H&amp;Js &#40;according
    to the method Erik described&#41;, comparing paragraphs that are the same except
    for the space width; then make the corresponding adjustment in the font. <BR>
