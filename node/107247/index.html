  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">How do I handle situations (dialogue, usually) where a sentence ends in an en dash (I prefer it to the em) followed by another punctuation mark?

Like:

1. (a) "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet – " / (b) "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet –"
2. (a) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet – ! / (b) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet –!
3. (a) "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet – !" / (b) "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet –!"

I've searched and searched and haven't found anything that's pointed me in the right direction. I vaguely remember seeing someone use the en but then switch to the em if it's at the end of a sentence/paragraph, but I don't find that particularly appealing. If I want to keep the en should I just keep the trailing space even if it's only followed by some punctuation mark(s) as opposed to the rest of a sentence?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chicago recommends the em dash as the general purpose "dash" punctuation character, with no space around it, but a whole lot of typographers don't like that. And there are plenty of situations in which this choice may be the designer's to make.

I generally don't use en dashes this way (a contemporary British practice, mainly), but I do use spaced em dashes this way (a contemporary American practice, mainly) — though I often condense them 75% as a visual compromise. Here are the rules:

1. Space the dash on both sides in running text: Lorem ipsum — dolor sit amet.
2. Space the dash even when it denotes an interruption: Lorem ipsum —
3. Do not put a space between the dash and a quotation mark: "Lorem ipsum —"
4. The only time the dash is ever flush with a text character is if a sentence ends <em>mid-word</em>: "Lorem ips—"

I can't really think of any plausible construction in standard contemporary English that would put a dash next to another punctuation character, so I've never considered it. Your examples 2 and 3 look ungrammatical to me. It's either a dash or an exclamation point, you can't have both. If the person is interrupted, then leave off the exclamation point.

Of course, dashes mixed with other punctuation were common in earlier forms of English, but then at that time they were always set as unspaced em dahes anyway, so there were no typographic choices to be made. Contemporary editorial practice doesn't generally allow dashes and other punctuation together, except quotes.

<em>If</em> I were using spaced en dashes as my general purpose dash character, which I have occasionally done, the <em>only</em> time I would use an em dash instead is if a sentence broke off mid-word. Otherwise, the rules above are the same. But then again, if there are a lot of interruptions in the text, I would argue that using the en as the standard dash is an inappropriate design choice, because a text with many interruptions probably warrants a stronger visual interruption on the page.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The problem is that this question really deals with dialogue in fiction, and most style guides are not for fiction. Chicago is useless as a guide for editing, say, a novel. It's a handbook for scholarly publishing. I doubt it has a stance on sentences ending partway through, as this is unlikely to come up in scholarly nonfiction. And even if it does have a stance, it's probably irrelevant because Chicago assumes an entirely different context.

There might be a style guide that the editor is using that can give you valid advice. But this is more likely a "house style" thing, or a typographer's choice. Besides, style guides are for editors. This is not an editorial decision, it's a typographic one — though if the editor doesn't like your decision, she will presumably disagree.

If you're looking for concrete guidance, it would be found not in an editorial style manual like Chicago or APA, but a typographic style manual like Bringhurst or Felici. Or an in-house typographic style manual, but these may very well be written per publication by the typographer who designs it — i.e., you.</div>

Maybe, but rarely in a professional context. First person to be satisfied is the client, and their editors, if any. That's just so you can get hired (again).

Next is the job you're hired for. That is almost never "pleasing yourself" (politicians should make note of this, too). There is always an audience. If you want to instruct that audience, write something. If nobody want's to buy it, you got one kind of answer on the value of your opinion.

An exception is if you can come up with something that pleases you, and no one else notices, esp. to the point of objection. "Not notices" is still best. Now as an aside, with dashes, we've found over a 25-year "test" that we can get away with setting a three-quarter em long dash centered in an em space. Go to a spaced en and you're going to get blowback -- as a number of well-known and accomplished designers from the U.K. learned when hey started working in the States. Or if you buy a book by an American author -- say Raymond Chandler -- published in the U.K., presuming a U.K audience, that stye will be used and some Americans will object. 

Why the fuss over the small matter of punctuation? Two reasons: Typography is about communication, not art. And if that seems lacking to you, consider this: if you don't see the principle, someday you're choose an inappropriate typeface because it "pleases you" -- like the idiot who chose Perpetua to set <cite> Up in the Old Hotel</cite>.
