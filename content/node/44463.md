body: "Well, for lack of a better term.  I might be suffering from the recency illusion,
  but I could swear here in Spain more typefaces than in the US use an S which has
  a straight or positive slope mid section, leaving white space in the top left and
  bottom right sections.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be more of a hand-written flourish (or
  display face characteristic) as I've never seen it used in body text, but I was
  wondering if anyone else has noticed it before, and if there are any design suggestions/ideals
  for it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/costanilladelosangeles_4321.jpg]\r\n\r\n(also
  this shows a nice LL, DE lig with the resizing and repositioning of letters to fill
  in white space common around here, full text is \"Costanilla de los \xC1ngeles\",
  a street sign from downtown Madrid.  sorry for the low quality, didn't have but
  my phone's camera)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
