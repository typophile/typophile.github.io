  body: For "Photographicatis" and the numbers I believe them to be Palatino using
    old style figures for the numbers. The lowercase letters are something else again--similar
    to Palatino but with cuts on some of the letter forms that give them a chiseled
    look. Possibly Palatino customized as the 'n', 'r', 'l', 'o', and 'm' all match.
