    font do you think is the closest to the original Roman stonechoppingwriting?\r\n\r\nI
    use Trajan...  but I amn't completly satisfied. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nI hope
    the mods will not exterminate me for threading within a thread?!\r\nI reckon they
    will sew me or crucify me with needles"

    in Rome. My name is Jan \u2013 TraJan. So Adobe (or Goudy) Trajan is as close
    as you can get ;-)"
