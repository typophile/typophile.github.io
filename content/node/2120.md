body: I just thought I&#39;d post this draft for typographical criticism. <BR> <BR>The
  logo is for an aromatherapy device. The client wants a techy, contemporate wordmark.
  <BR> <BR>All letters are hand-drawn. Please forgive the Handel-like &#34;e&#34;.

  body: I was pleasantly suprised, when I recieved an e-mail describing the Logo as
    needing to be a &#39;techy, contemporate wordmark&#39;, I immediately thought
    that this person had gone for the obvious. Like I say I was pleasantly suprised,
    I agree that the E doesn&#39;t feel right to me and the placement of the &#39;cells&#39;
    looks odd... haven&#39;t got time to do too much so it&#39;s easier just to show
    a a quick suggestion <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20756.jpg"

  body: Isn&#39;t this too rigid? Would you be out of line in suggesting to the client
    that aroma stuff is sensual, not techy? I know it&#39;s for some sort of device
    &#40;like a humidifier?&#41;, but it seems you need at least some hint of humanity
    in there. Maybe a flick of sorts in one of the letters? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Nice ideas, Adriano. I&#39;ve been trying to emphasize horizontal movement,
    which is why I used the e and g that I did, as well as the serifs on the x and
    y. <BR> <BR>Hrant: I agree about a human/organic touch, although I&#39;ve been
    drawing a blank. <BR> <BR>Paul'

  body: 'Paul: <BR> <BR>I think the general direction works, however, I&#39;m feeling
    Hrant&#39;s remarks. If you continue in the direction you&#39;re heading I would
    have two possible suggestions: &#40;1&#41; extend the &#34;E&#34; horizontally,
    as it appears too small relative to the other letter forms, and &#40;2&#41; increase
    the serifs of &#34;x&#34; to be slightly larger than that of the &#34;y&#34; &#40;or
    just lose the &#34;y&#34; serifs&#41;, as the &#34;y&#34; appears gargantuan compared
    to the other letterforms. If you decide to move a little further, you may try
    softening the serifs so there are less hard angles &#40;again, maybe losing the
    &#34;y&#34; serifs&#41;. One more thought'

  body: Try using a gradient in the type Solid at the bottom and fade to paper color
    at the top. Imply aroma, maybe a texture in the type?
