  body: What has been the role of poorly-skilled type designers in the proliferation
    of bad typefaces? Don't blame the tools. The internet on the other hand...

  body: Computers made it easier to make type. They didn't make it easier to make
    <em>bad</em> type; it has always been easier to make bad art than good art.

  body: "The tools don't make their product bad. But it is true that in the old days
    of hot metal, few people would attempt to design type. Those that did were likely
    to be gainfully employed by typefoundries.\r\n\r\nWhen just anyone can design
    a typeface when the fancy takes him, then it would be quite reasonable to suspect
    that unqualified people would now attempt to design typefaces where they would
    not have done so before.\r\n\r\nThe computer is not at fault for doing anything
    to the type designs seen as bad, but their existence and proliferation may be
    a consequence of the new situation that the existence of computer typography has
    brought about."

    I could nowadays rub together a bunch of outlines and call the result a font.
    I probably won''t; I still have so much fun using them.'

  body: "The digital era has democratized type design. Anybody can do it now. That's
    a fine thing.\r\n\r\nYes, it means that the percentage of poorly-made junk has
    skyrocketed. But anybody can design type who wants to. The tools are freely available.
    The how-to resources are a bit scattered, but all there and affordable.\r\n\r\nI
    hate crap. But the answer is to educate, inform and encourage good type design,
    not to keep the tools away from the masses."

  body: "The other effect of \"digital\" type design is that more and more, what I
    think of as hand lettering is now being offered as fonts. I Don't mean calligraphy,
    rather signage and the hand lettering you use to see in print ads.\r\n\r\nAs the
    letterforms of signage creep into fonts that are used for other purposes, many
    people haven't figured out the full effect of those letterforms. So, for example,
    we're getting fonts whose purported use is for text, but the fonts don't work
    well with traditional word spacing and leading used for extended text. Some do,
    most don't.\r\n\r\nA typeface useful for many purposes is a matter of both letterforms
    and spacing. It's easy to come up with \"fresh\" letterforms. But getting proper
    spacing and fit of these characters, suitable for any text that can come along,
    is a different matter. Often, part of the spacing solution involves modifying
    the letterforms themselves.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this well. The point is good
    hand lettering is not the same as good type, and people who aspire to designing
    fonts need to understand just why that is so."

  body: "It's not the tool, but it <em>is</em> the ease of publishing. In the past
    you had to invest a lot more to put a font on the market, and there were people
    besides the designer standing to lose a job if it sold poorly \u2013 all that
    naturally set higher quality standards.\r\n\r\nThe main practical consequence
    of this is that choosing good type now requires more time.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I definitely agree with Thomas Phinney that making it easier to design type
    is a good thing, even though it has had the one bad result of more poor designs
    to look through.
