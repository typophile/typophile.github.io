  seen what seems to be a freebie knock-off called ambient that is similar, but i
  swear i've seen a pro version somewhere.\r\n\r\nthe font is also used on the cover
  of the uk edition for 'paul of dune'\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Paul-Dune-Legends-Brian-Herbert/dp/0340837543/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229742187&sr=8-1\r\n\r\nthanks!"
