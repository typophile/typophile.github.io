  body: "Best would do it by hand, but you could approximate it by:\r\n\r\n - posterizing
    the photo (to reduce the colors used and to provide areas of flat color)\r\n -
    reduce the resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation.\r\n - increase the
    resolution back up using nearest neighbor interpolation\r\n\r\nYou'd then have
    to go in to add the 'grout' between the pixels and tweak things (specifically,
    giving the image the black outline).\r\n\r\n"
