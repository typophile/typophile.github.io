  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,
I am working on a font based on my handwriting and have included instructions for ligatures for the typical ffi ffl etc and also for er ar to &hellip;letters that I normally join in my handwriting.
However the font includes modern greek and polytonic greek&hellip;and I want to include some ligatures for a few joined letters in modern greek.
For instance how would I include the substitution for epsilon and iotatonos by glyph FB10 (which at this point is also named fb10)?
I put in the opentype instructions initially using VOLT. When I opened the font in Fontlab there was also a feature called zz01 this basically includes all the same info as the liga feature which also appears. Is this extra feature needed for liga to work?
feature zz01 {</p>
<h1 id="latin">Latin</h1>
<p>language zz01 exclude_dflt;
sub a r by FB05;
sub e r by fb06;
sub f f i by ffi;
sub f f l by ffl;
sub f f by ff;
sub f i by fi;
sub f l by fl;
sub l l by fb07;
sub t h by fb08;
sub t o by fb09;
sub a y by fb0a;
sub t i by fb0b;
sub a u by fb0c;
sub t y by fb0d;
sub o u by fb0e;
} zz01;</p>
<p>I have also tried to use class based kerning using the instructions with fontlab but when I create the font and try to test the kerning the only letters which kern are the initail ones used to set up the kerning group. Am I missing something in settings? Currently in my font there are 1922 kerning pairs, is this extreme?</p>
<p>Any help in any of these areas would be very greatfully received.
Thanks
Neil</p>

<p>I recommend adopting a proper glyph naming scheme rather than ad-hoc names like &ldquo;fb06&rdquo;. Read more here: 
<a href="http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=3065">http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=3065</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When FontLab decompiles an OpenType font with features created in VOLT, it sometimes needs to add the &ldquo;zzXX&rdquo;. This does not mean these features are in the font. Due to the nature of the Adobe FDK for OpenType source notation (.fea) used in FontLab&rsquo;s OpenType panel, certain features cannot be directly expressed in the source notation as is. This is a limitation of the current version of the Adobe FDK for OpenType that is likely to be improved in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Relying on the OpenType feature notation decompiled by FontLab from an existing font is not recommended. The decompilation works in many cases, but it surely does not represent 100% preciseness.</p>
<p>Regards, 
Adam</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Adam,
Thanks for replying.
Could you possibly direct me how to implement the liga feature for use with greek characters to be used with a greek layout keyboard( not a physical greek keyboard, but where you can change lanuages for your keyboard). I tried just adding the substitutions to the list already but it causes errors.
Also what am I doing wrong regrding class kerning.
Many thanks again
Neil</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>hi,
i am workng on a opentype font in fontlab and i was wondering if there was a way to have several differnt options for the same charachter within the same opentype feature. For example swashes if i wanted to replcae the glyph A with A.swsh i would type</p>
<p>feature swsh {sub A by A.swsh;}swsh</p>
<p>but if i wanted to give another glyph ontion on the leter A within the same opentype feature is there another way to do it. What I want is to have several glyph applied on top of each other so that the text can give he impression of being randomy chosen.</p>
<p>If any one could help me with this i would be very greatful.</p>
<p>Many Thanks 
Neil</p>
