When looking at the examples of Chagrin, I can't help but be reminded of both Berhold's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/city/">City</a> and Zuzana's <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/cholla/">Cholla</a>. These aren't bad things. In fact, I love this type of character squarishness. <BR> <BR>Chagrin has a friendlier feel to me, as compared to the others mentioned above. I'd have to say that I actually prefer the first version of the serif. It's more distinctive from the other variation. Although the second one blends better with the sans and semiserif weights, maybe that's the point.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>It seems the Heavy embodies the most interesting essence. The other two weights don't seem genuine enough, especially not the Regular.</i> <BR>This is definitely true. The heavy makes the most of the square/round contrast while the regular just seems square.  <BR>  <BR><i>So I suspect you're doing the &quot;weight loss&quot; too literally - I'd give the lighter weights more roundness for example.</i> <BR>Agreed. More roundness in the regular would make it more texworthy also. The trick is keeping the flavor of the heavy, with a different structure! Back to the drawing board for that. <BR> <BR><i>Your serif tests at the bottom give me an idea: maybe this is a good design to implement the concept that different weight can sometimes have different structures. Specifically, I see the Heavy as being happiest in the &quot;Serif 2&quot; scheme (the &quot;Serif 1&quot; has too many serifs), while the Regular might really get into its own as a sans. Which might mean the Bold should be a semi?</i> <BR> <BR>Hmm, that's a thought I hadn't considered. Are there other fonts that do this successfully? My guess is that the serifs are going to be what keeps the the regular weight looking like it's part of the same family after I add more roundness. Anybody else have thoughts about this idea? <BR> <BR><i>Lastly: I'm getting a tingle when I think about italic possibilities for this&hellip;</i> <BR>I'm just gonna oblique it!

		<div class="commentbody">Randy, I think you might have actually gone too far: don't lose the straight segments on the insides of the counters (not just for aesthetic reasons, but also for easy interpolation). Here's an idea: where the flats are in the Heavy, keep at least some flatness in the lighter weights, but make them angled (not horizontal), and <i>then</i> flowing into the curves. Did I explain that OK? <BR> <BR>One other thing: you're getting this strange &quot;butt jut&quot; at the lower-left of the &quot;e&quot;, even though the stem is straight (pun unintended). Maybe shorten the straight part of the stem? <BR> <BR>Yeah, and the &quot;f&quot; height. <BR> <BR>BTW, I don't know if you realize, but you're moving into Unger terrority here&hellip; Which to me is a Good Thing. Curiously though, I know of only one other instance of people making type like Unger: the recent Dagen fonts. Maybe his style is slightly too fringe to imitate comfortably. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, I have some more feedback based on the cavalry PDF. Interestingly, the Regular seems to have more problems that the Heavy, and the Bold consistently has just a diluted subset of those. <BR> <BR>Overall: <BR>- Are you doing something funky with your &quot;f&quot; height? It might make sense since it's the only ascender that's not a stick, but if so it's too pronounced. <BR>- I'd make the left part of the bar of the &quot;f&quot; longer. <BR>- Those asymmetrical foot serifs (and not just the nice long right sides in the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;r&quot;) are great. <BR>- Love the dots! <BR>- The &quot;k&quot; is a conundrum. I'm not sure about that separation. <BR>- I'd give the &quot;el&quot; a stronger foot half-serif. <BR>- I'd give the &quot;q&quot; a stronger ear. <BR>- The bottoms of &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are too soft. <BR>- I'm thinking your &quot;y&quot; should be v-style. <BR> <BR>Regular: <BR>- The &quot;a&quot; is attractive, but it seems to have bypassed your early move to more curviness, and it's not &quot;belonging&quot; with the rest. Note that making it conform would actually make it very Ungerish. <BR>- The leg of the &quot;k&quot; ends too delicately. <BR>- I think the &quot;o&quot; is too square. <BR>- The &quot;r&quot; beak is weak. <BR>- There's something wrong with the &quot;s&quot;. The terminals seem off, especially the top. <BR>- The &quot;t&quot; is too shy. <BR>- The right-bottom of the &quot;x&quot;: same problem as the &quot;k&quot;. <BR> <BR>Heavy: <BR>- You need some of that straighness in all the arches (like in the &quot;h&quot;). <BR> <BR>BTW, I'm really liking the idea of structural divergence between the Heavy and the others. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

As you can see they are a natural extrapolation from the heavy weight. Seeing all the ducks in a row, do you still think they are too chunky? I slanted them both forward as a practical space issue in the black. No room for any other kind of treatment. I don't think it changes the original too much. It might even make it a little more *icy*. <BR> <BR>You can also see the interpolation changes the width of the bold and heavy weights but the regular remains at original width. <BR> <BR>Finally, the g: I'm gonna reserve judgement on it until I've drawn a regular g so I can see what it looks like across all weights. The problem I saw with the original g is that it looks less like a g and more like a c + j (essentially what it is). It was my least favorite of the old set so I was hankering for change. We'll see. <BR> <BR><i>Will any of your stuff be available in the near future?</i> <BR>I sure hope so. The only font that is anywhere close to ready is the jensonesque serif. That will hopefully be available in 2004. Can't say where yet. This has a long way to go, but I hope to finish it before spring. Given that this hobby has become a serious time gobbler, it'd be nice to see a some coin from the efforts! <BR> <BR>Cheers. <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Typophiles, <BR> <BR>Here are some caps for you to chew on. These were a royal pain in the posterior. (A shoutout to Christian Robertson for his encouragement on them). The results, I think, happily relate to the lc. I intoduced the semi serifs because there is a little semi serifage happening in the lc, but also because it countered the woodtype tendency and leaves it feeling fresh. After developing this weight I'm pretty sure it will not be a straight interpolation to the regular weight. Too many quirks at this size. <BR> <BR>(BTW I will be reproportioning the lc, per your comments Eduardo, William) Thanks one and all! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24147.gif" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey, that UC looks exactly right! Very nice work. And the semi-serif action is great - I wonder if you should turn some of the full-serifs (like on the right leg of the &quot;A&quot;) into semis. <BR> <BR>Don't you think they're a little bit too small? I actually like smallish caps (especially since they alleviate the need for &quot;true&quot; smallcaps - which very few people actually end up using), but maybe a hair larger would make them more in their [alphabetic] character. <BR> <BR>Some specifics: <BR>A: I might make the top curl less pronounced - maybe with a short flat segment on the top-left. Your structure is working great when on the bottom (&quot;V&quot;, etc.) but seems too soft on top. <BR>B: If you can do so without destroying the rigidity, try curving the top and bottom more out, to couteract the optical effect of bowing in. <BR>M: Isn't working. <BR>S: Too sharp inside. <BR>U: What about a full right stem? <BR> <BR>This font is getting amazing - I feel like squeezing the glyphs to get some chocolate icecream out of them!
