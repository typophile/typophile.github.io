  body: "Very nice on the whole!\r\n\r\nA couple things: why the large space between
    \"whom\" and \"we?\" Also, do you have a non-system cut of Garamond? That minuscule
    <em>a</em> is an eyesore. To be clear, I think Garamond is a great choice for
    this piece, just try a different cut if you've got one. Garamond Premier Pro would
    work beautifully if you've got it...\r\n\r\nAlso, it should be \"who,\" not \"whom,\"
    as you it refers to the subject, and is not the objective case.\r\n\r\nCongrats,
    by the way. Our first is coming up on 11 months of age. They're not joking when
    they say it flies by. Good luck!"

  body: "Micro commented on the type, so I'll talk on the imagery real quick.\r\n\r\n1.
    The building blocks used for the initials are a really great idea. The perspective
    on the blocks looks off. This is not a tough fix in illustrator. \r\n\r\n2. The
    baby building blocks I remember had an edge around the cutout letters. So the
    images on the front of each block would be taken down a little bit so that there
    is some block showing around it. \r\n\r\nCool concept and congrats."

  body: "Micro,\r\n\r\nWonderful comments, thanks. I do have Garamond Premier Pro
    and what a difference it makes! Congrats on your little one!\r\n\r\n\r\nNachos,\r\n\r\nI
    am not so fabulous at drawing in perspective...can you be more specific so that
    I can fix it? I attached an image I saw online does this look more correct to
    you?\r\n\r\nAlso your second comment..do you mean like an outline around the edge
    of each block? If not please explain.\r\n\r\nLast question to you both: i like
    the Zebra, I love the Antelope, but I am not so sure about the Lion..what do you
    think am I nit picking or should I keep looking for another Lion illustration?\r\n\r\nthanks
    to you both![img:sites/default/files/old-images/baby-blocks-quilt-pattern-2_5570.jpg]\r\n"

    cubes using a single vanishing point for all of them, like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cubes_5481.gif]"
