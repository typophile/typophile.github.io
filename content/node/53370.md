body: "Hi, I'm looking into Christian's <i>Graphik</i> for an identity I'm working
  on. (Actually my client loved it in use in Wallpaper!) Since it's not around yet
  I've been searching for typefaces with similar flavour. I'm considering URW's <i>Neuzeit
  S</i>, but the severe lack of weights (and italics) is a turn off. Also a serif
  companion might come in handy. I'd love some suggestions!\r\n\r\nCheers"
