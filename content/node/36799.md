  struggling to find a font that allows this, as I will not be able to control the
  end number of users. Does anyone have a suggestion as to where I could buy a font
  for this use? Its only a small personal project of mine, so there is a very limited
  budget.\r\n\r\nThanking you in advance for any assistance offered.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "(Limited Budget + Unlimited Number of Users) = Not gonna happen with any
    commercial font/foundry.\r\n\r\nAbout the only way you could pull this off is
    to commission a custom face/faces of your own, but that's gonna put you way over
    budget too.\r\n\r\nTry sticking to \"core\" fonts that ship with most/all computers
    these days (Times Roman, for example). Heck, even Apple only uses a dozen or so
    faces in their Keynote templates, and they've got deeper pockets than most.\r\n"

  body: "Font embedding as defined in the OpenType and TrueType specs relates to embedding
    fonts in 'documents', I think font vendors might take the position that \"templates\"
    are not documents in this sense. \r\n\r\nIf you (or your attorney) can successfully
    argue that templates are 'documents' then you might look to 'editable' embedding
    fonts. Two big gotchas here, the only people who regularly set their fonts to
    editable are Microsoft and Adobe, second gotcha would be that most font EULAs
    wouldn't allow commercial redistribution.\r\n\r\nSo in my opinion embedding is
    a dead-end here, especially if it's a way to avoid paying licensing fees. \r\n\r\nYou
    might want to look at what Ascender did with their Creativity Font Pack where
    the fonts are bundled with templates.       \r\n"
