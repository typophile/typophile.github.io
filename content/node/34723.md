  designed for use in 18 different countries (listed below). We have not done a project
  of this scale before (ie, a project outside of the US) so we are at a bit of a loss
  on where to begin.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, if anyone could provide feedback on how
  to handle type and colors (colors to avoid and color system to use...eg, pantone,
  or other) it would be much appreciated. In addition, any tips or tricks that anyone
  may know of that would be great too...or, if you know of any good reference sites/books.\r\n\r\nWe
  use Mac OX 10.x with InDesign/Illustrator/Photoshop CS 3. The website will be built
  in Flash.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your time/help. If a similar question is
  posted somewhere else I apologize because I could not find it.\r\n\r\nCountry Listing:\r\n\r\nBrazil
  (either Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo)\r\nSouth Africa (either Johannesburg or Cape
  Town)\r\nUganda\r\nDubai\r\nEastern Eurpoe (not sure of city)\r\nWestern Europe
  (not sure of city)\r\nEast Asia\r\nHong Kong\r\nManila, Philippines\r\nIndonesia\r\nSydney,
  Australia\r\nMexico City\r\nVancouver, BC\r\nSouth Korea\r\nTokyo\r\nHawaii"

  body: "Your question is WAY to broad, vague and unfocused to get a relevant answer
    to whatever it is you might be thinking or wondering about. How could anyone help
    when they have no idea what it is your are trying to do; for whom ( or what kind
    of whom); or any other kind of context? Answer - they can't. Try again with some
    context & detail.\r\n\r\nBTW - As of this time ( and arguably improperly! ) Hawaii
    is not it's own political entity that is to say it is not it's own 'country'.
    It might be a unique market though. And looking closer I see that you have actually
    got cities in mind anyway.... Or it seems that way. Anyway. Whatever. Sort yourself
    out!\r\n"

    of the production for typography and inquiring as to \"politically correct\" colors.\r\n\r\nWe
    are not looking for visual critique or feedback regarding the layout and design.
    We might post something later on but for now we are still at a research stage.\r\n\r\nBasically,
    any general or specific information we can get would be welcome. Especially from
    anyone who has had experience with non-roman characters and has designed pieces
    for the regions listed in the first post."

    you\u2019ll probably have to hire one for each area. Leslie Cabarga did a color
    book that covers international colors schemes pretty well, but as for type, that\u2019s
    something that requires professionals."

    or localization company... I used to work for one that has <a href="http://www.translations.com/locations_atlanta.html">offices
    in Atlanta</a>.

  body: "In the context of Typophile (color? sure, any color, as long as it's black)
    the\r\nimportant question might be: how much visual consistency would you like\r\nto
    have between the fonts for the various scripts/languages? If the answer is\r\n\"not
    much\" then we might be able to recommend a patchwork of fonts that\r\ncover your
    needs in that area; otherwise, you'll need to hire a typographer\r\nwho really
    knows the multi-script font scene as a consultant.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Ricardo/hrant...We want the colors and secondary grahpics to remain
    as consistent as possible from place to place. We realize some things may need
    to be changed for cultural relevance, etc and that is okay. \r\n\r\nThe fonts
    however, don't need to be consistent from language to language...especially if
    it will make things easier. A \"patchwork\" may be fine."

  body: Keeping the overall color scheme consistent from place to place may ensure
    that you are less effective - nearly everywhere. Keeping a consistent color scheme
    to the identity make sense however. These are different things.
