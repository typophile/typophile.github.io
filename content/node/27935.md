body: "In Boston I collared Norbert Florendo about a couple of points that I thought
  might be useful for the education session next year.  I may be a bit ahead of myself,
  but, I want to share with everyone my thoughts before the academic year begins and
  I forget my immediate impressions.  TypeCon 2006 was my first experience with the
  group and I had a blast.  I have practiced graphic design for over thirty years
  and typography has been the impetus. In addition to private practice I now teach
  graphic design and typography.  Standing in the classroom sharing years of experience
  I wonder if by teaching I gain more than I give.  When I teach I learn and there
  is always something to learn.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose a theme for the next
  education session: \r\n\r\nCollaboration and teamwork.  It works.  \r\n\r\nBy nature
  I am a loner.  But recently I discovered that I become totally engaged while working
  on a project with colleagues.  The euphoria derived from the successful conclusion
  of a goal is as good, if not better, than what is sought after in drugs, sex & rock.
  The quality I bring to each table is the individualism and creativity only I possess.
  \ But this means nothing if not utilized collectively.  I have this weird abhorrence
  for worms and I wonder if maybe my soul fears that the only audience I will have
  for my creative genius is the creatures surrounding me while I decompose. \r\n\r\nDuring
  the education session of TypeCon 2006 I heard several times about how much the profession
  has evolved into us being chief, cook and bottle washer.  Extrapolate this notion
  throughout the centuries and I note that successful typographers have always been
  thus.  Collaborate with your elders, your juniors, your IT personnel and the mailman;
  learn to draw, write and converse.  Have a fruit-smoothie with the twelve-year old
  learning Java script in summer camp.  The more we work as a team the better off
  we will be.\r\n\r\nHope to see you'all next year for TypeCon 2007, let me know if
  I can be part of the education session.  I was impressed with what I saw at the
  2006 conference and value the opportunity to build on this.\r\n"
