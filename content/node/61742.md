  adding inktraps and lowering the x-height for smaller sizes."

    You need more light inside and around the black* in smaller sizes. This should
    be the case in pretty much any old metal face (and/or do get that book).\r\n*
    Which typically also gets heavier.\r\n\r\nThis might be interesting, or maybe

    :) I'm considering the need for more space, though I'm also considering the need
    for more distinct wordshapes.

  body: "Many metal typefaces had an increased x-height in smaller sizes. In many
    of the examples I have studied the variation of the descender length is literally
    the only change that was made to the letter shapes.\r\nThe interesting thing is
    that in some cases the descenders are longer in large text sizes than they are
    in very small fonts but they get shorter again in the display sizes, having a
    maximum at around 14 pt or so. This makes sense, of course: making the x-height
    as big as possible in small sizes on one hand, and making the vertical proportions
    more \"compact\" in the display sizes to allow for tighter headline setting.\r\n\r\nGiven
    that adjusting the descender height is not much effort, especially in the digital
    world, I think including different options would make sense and give the typographer
    more flexibility \u2013 you may want super-tight newspaper-style headlines, or
    an airy layout with elegant long extenders and more generous leading. I think
    using an OpenType feature such as titling alternates would make things easier,
    you wouldn't need separate fonts."

  body: What good does just lowering the asc/descenders? That doesn't automatically
    give larger counters than you get by not lowering the asc/desc. It's relative
    to point size, which again is a rather vauge term. The only change will be the
    option to set lines tighter.

  body: Thomas -- If I'm not mistaken, Standard Alignment is basically Point Line
    (Updike relates them thus), which was established to allow types of different
    sizes to be aligned using 1-point leads or their multiples. I don't think optimizing
    proportions for readability at differing sizes played any part.

    in descender proportions from very small sizes to text sizes to display sizes
    probably are indeed related to size-relevant considerations. And I agree with
    the probable reasons that Tim gives.\r\n\r\nI cite Standard Line as an explanation
    for any micro trends of descender variation between proximate sizes."

  body: "Okay, I can buy the second post.  :)\r\n\r\nTo clarify my own previous comment:
    the descender/ascender proportions established in Standard Alignment were likely
    based on the proportions in common use at the time for the various sizes in question,
    and those in turn would have generally reflected optical size variation. Folks
    could have invented the standard alignment numbers based on measurements of actual
    type, and hence reflected pre-existing optical size considerations, and promoted
    future optical size proportions, yet that need not have been a deliberate objective
    as such.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "*Maybe*. On the other hand, there were those who decried Standard Alignment
    when it was first adopted.\r\n\r\nUpdike states the case thus: \"There are mechanical
    advantages inherent in this scheme, but they are attained at the expense of the
    correct proportion of certain letters. . . . This disregard for proportionate
    length of descenders of types of different sizes pervades the whole scheme; and
    consequently no size of type (excepting possibly 7-point and 11-point) which is
    cast on Standard Line can have descenders of adequate length.\" [D. B. Updike,
    <cite>Printing Types</cite> Vol 1, p.35. Cambridge: Belknap Press, 1922]\r\n\r\nWhen
    Updike starts ranting, you have to take it with a grain of salt; but this makes
    me question just how much Standard Line conformed to traditionally accepted optimum
    proportions for sizes."
