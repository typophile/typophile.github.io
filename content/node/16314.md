  upon a really deep blue color, and I was going for PMS 296, but do you think this
  is a good choice? Would you guys suggest anything else that would work? '

  body: Why ask us? If you and the client agree on 296, then use it. Don't second-guess
    yourself, and don't screw up one of the few occasions on which you and the client
    WILL agree.

  body: 'Well, me and the client have really just agreed upon a really deep blue,
    not the final PMS. Thats why I asked, is PMS 296 a good choice, or is there a
    more "potent" blue PMS around? '

  body: "It is more an issue of what it will be used with.  The blue does not live
    in a vacuum.  Also, how much of it? If your design is big solids, it may need
    to be different than if you are using the color in fine lines.  You might post
    a GIF of it.\r\n\r\nI also consider if the 4-color build of the PMS is reasonable.
    \ Very intense spot colors don't seperate well too often. Often, you won't have
    the luxury of a spot color--for instance ina magazine ad.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Take in count what Chris wrote. Also, for a printer blue color is the most
    difficult color to print in offset. What I could suggest is to choose your color
    in process as the basic reference if you plan to print the most of your document
    in 4 color process. If dont choose the PMS as the reference. An other way to choose
    a color is to work with the DS chart. Personaly, I find the blue color is easier
    to choose with DS and even match with PMS. That chart came with the PMS chart.

  body: The CMYK conversion (solid to process) is pretty close. Not as dark, but you
    could tweak the mix. 100C/47M/0Y/69K for ref.

    really bad drying times. If you have a cast coated stock they are almost impossible
    to work with. I would consult with your clients printer before finalizing it as
    "the color". '

  body: "The Royal Bank (Canada) has a really dark blue as a corporate color, and
    uses a spot color on upscale printed jobs.\r\n\r\nBut it also uses gold (4C approx.
    or special foil, ink, etc) to perk things up.\r\n\r\nYou will probably need a
    little bit of bright zing to go with the Dark blue, or the effect could be rather
    dreary and uninteresting."

    to dry than others and it has a distinctive smell.\r\nThe stock you are printing
    on will also make a considerable difference for an uncoated stock you might decide
    you need a much lighter colour to compensate for the reduced reflection and increased
    absorbency.\r\nTim"

  body: "I'm watching for the type, too. But while we wait, I can tell you I worked
    for a large company that used PMS 294 for its logo. The high quantity of Reflex
    Blue made it not only difficult to deal with  in drying times, etc., but unreliable
    in terms of cosistency. The primary pigments in Reflex blue and rotamine red are
    prone to hue shifts under varying conditions, making matching across collateral
    very difficult, unless you're printing it all at the same time at the same print
    shop.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, things like this are the burden of the printer.
    You're paying them to get it right."
