  \r\nLittle Bird Therapies is a very small business providing homemade therapies.\r\nI
  am open to critiques, especially on the type treatment which doesn't look finished
  to me.\r\n\r\nThe parchment is not a part of the logo at all, it is just a background
  that I was thinking about putting it on.\r\n\r\nI am a huge fan of this site and
  this is my first post, so please be kind.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LB.jpg]"

  body: "I really like the bird, although it has a kinda 'snooty' look about it's
    face. I think it's the way it's staring into the distance with it's nose turned
    up.\r\n\r\nThe type might look a lot better if it was actually printed on the
    parchment, and perhaps the bird as well? I think 'THERAPIES' doesn't look very
    therapeutic - are they u/c or small caps? i can't tell - but either way i think
    l/c could look better.\r\n\r\nGraham"

  body: "The bird is really nice and well done. \r\nBut I think you have done too
    much strokes at its tail. Its not balanced. The bird looks left weighted. \r\nAlso
    it doesnt look like a little bird. I would shorten the body and tail a bit and
    make the stomach wider. Now it looks like a pigeon not like a sweet little tomtit.\r\n\r\nLook
    at these tiny sweet birds to check your proportions:\r\nhttp://www.naturfotografie-digital.de/GR10/GRBM130105-2024.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.naturfotografie-digital.de/GR10/GRSM130105-1966.jpg\r\n\r\nGreetings:

  body: Hi, I like the bird too, and I also agree with Steven that it looks little
    off balance and "pigeony." The curves are so intricate that I was looking for
    a hidden scripty  "L" and "B" which might look interesting (I'd try it, if it
    doesn't work, you can always go back). I'd suggest trying to simplify the type.
    Bold and different color is not necessary. You have three words and each has a
    different treatment which I think is too much. I like the green/brown combination,
    but I'd explore one color versions. The parchment compliments the colors very
    well, but it will be probably used on many different backgrounds so I wouldn't
    think of it as a part of a logo and worked with white background (at least for
    now). Nice start.

    know why but it reminds me a bit of a thinking pose\r\n"

  body: Shouldn't a little bird be little and maybe sit on the title. I'm not in love
    with the type, why make bird more important than little, I see no reason. It souldn't
    read little. Bird. It needs to read as little bird. The letter spacing needs work
    and you have to justify why little is with a lowercase l like the b in bird. Therapies
    is just to strong for this treatment and it too has letter spacing problems. Its
    a nice start but its a start, keep going

  body: 'The bird is wonderful, but the break in the chest bothers me, and I also
    looked to see if there was hidden lettering in the illustration as well; which
    in my mind would be easy to incorporate but might be a bit too much. I feel as
    though the type needs to be a bit more inviting, ditch the all caps and try to
    find a way to avoid the use of extra weights and faces. '
