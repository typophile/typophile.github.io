  Marcus Ulpius Traianus. Born 53 AD. Died 117 AD. [[Roman]] Emperor from 98\u2013117
  (during which point the Empire would reach it's greatest extent).\r\n\r\n<strong>[[Indices]]
  : [[Typefaces]] : Trajan</strong>\r\n\r\nTrajan <strong>2:</strong> A typeface designed
  in 1989 by [[Carol Twombly]] for [[Adobe]].\r\n\r\n<em>Trajan,</em> i.e., the lettered
  inscription on the base of [[Trajans Column|Trajan's Column]] in Rome, is often
  regarded as one of the best models of the Imperial Roman alphabet. Trajan's Column
  was erected by the Senate and People of Rome as a memorial the Emperor Marcus Ulpius
  Traianus' wars, which slightly extended the Empire's frontiers even further into
  \"barbarian\" territory than it had already been.\r\n\r\nContrary to the belif of
  some, the lettering on the base of Trajan's Column was neither the debut of the
  [[Roman Alphabet]], nor the first time that it had used [[serifs]]. It is, however,
  probably the most famous example of both.\r\n\r\nWhile Roman handwriting was very
  different from Roman monumental lettering (whether hand painted, engraved, cut out
  of metal, or cut into stone), the letters on Trajan's Column represent one of the
  best examples left to us from antiquity. Trajan's Column, and samples like it, would
  go on to influence the development of the Roman alphabet, and later typeface design,
  for the next 2,000 years.\r\n\r\nWhat was so special about the Roman's inscriptional
  lettering? The Romans\u2014who did not invent the idea of the alphabet\u2014were
  the first to put serifs on their letters. It is speculated that the [[serif]]'s
  origin was a result of applying a brush to the stone before it was carved. Others
  speculate the serifs were purely an aesthetic addition, put there by the stone carver(s).\r\n\r\nThere
  have been several typefaces that are direct \"revivals\" of the lettering on Trajan's
  Column. The most direct and most popular\u2014and the only one to simply bear the
  name \"Trajan\"\u2014is Twombly's cut for Adobe. Other notable versions include

  <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/imperium/>Imperium</a>. <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wilton/cyan/>Cyan</a>
  is an attempt to add a lowercase to the classical roman square capitals.\r\n\r\nAdobe's
  Trajan is an all caps alphabet. [[Small capitals]] take the place of the lowercase
  glyphs, as Trajan's Coulumn certainly did not have any symbols similar to our present-days
  lowercase letters on them (these were invented centuries later).\r\n\r\n<strong>Discussion:</strong>\r\n<a
