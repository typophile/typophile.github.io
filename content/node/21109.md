  \ Or is it something less common?\r\n\r\nHere's the first image I found through
  image searching.\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/dotpolka/83025846/\r\n\r\nBut judging
  from the image search results, it seems that there's an inconsistency in the type
  used?"

  body: I'm sure there are different manufacturers of this tape. This one is less
    typographically correct than others I've seen. It's a [[squooshed]] <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.120906.0.24&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=POLICE+LINE+DO+NOT+CROSS&sampleSize=24">Helvetica
    Inserat</a>.

  body: Hi, I am the person who took the picture. The police line tape I photographed
    was a movie prop. It is possible that it is not the original tape used by police,
    which would explain the odd typography. Hope this helped.
