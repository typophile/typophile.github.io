  web-based medical software product. Sample pages below. <BR> <BR>So far I&#39;m
  using an old favorite, Avenir. But as the product positions itself as being innovative
  but relatively neutral to some of the trends in technology advertising, I&#39;m
  attempting to introduce Clarendon into the picture.  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a sample
  spread with Avenir for the headline, somewhat Apple-esque and relatively &#34;safe&#34;:
  <BR><a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/misc/foldout1.gif" target="_blank">http://www.cameronmoll.com/misc/foldout1.gif</a>
  <BR> <BR>Now here&#39;s the same piece with Clarendon, a bit shy of the norm and
  somewhat daring: <BR><a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/misc/foldout2.gif" target="_blank">http://www.cameronmoll.com/misc/foldout2.gif</a>
  <BR> <BR>Does the Clarendon headline fly? Or is it too daring? Feedback appreciated.
  <BR> <BR>&#40;If you&#39;d prefer to see other pages to get a better feel, lemme
  know.&#41;'

    First thing that pops up  <BR>in my mind is <a href="http://www.psyops.com/" target="_blank">
    Psy/Ops</a>. Check the sans, for example: <BR><a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_default.html"
    target="_blank"> Default Gothic</a> | <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_faceplate.html"
    target="_blank"> Faceplate Sans</a> | <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_hydrous.html"
    target="_blank"> Hydrous</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_reykjavik1.html"
    target="_blank">  Reykjavik</a>. <BR>Those are all very modern, forward thinking
    designs,  <BR>but without shouting it into your face if you grasp what  <BR>I
    mean. Perfect choices for what you&#39;re aiming for. <BR> <BR>Somewhat more adventurous
    are  <BR><a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_reform.html" target="_blank">
