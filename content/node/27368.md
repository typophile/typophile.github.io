  sure of the real world implications of this though...\r\n\r\n<CITE>For example,
  people were more likely to predict underdogs when the questionnaire on which they
  made their predictions was printed in a difficult-to-read font. The increased effort
  provoked by reading the difficult font made people feel less confident in their
  intuitions, and they were more likely to predict underdogs as a result.</CITE>\r\n\r\nI'll
  see if Kevin can shed any light on this.\r\n\r\nSi"

    fluency (in this case caused by low perceptual (vs. conceptual) fluency) in other
    studies as well (also at yale school of management). \r\n\r\nNovemsky et al. (2004),
    for instance, used an italic embossed arial (i think), which looks very faint
    and hard to read. low fluency increases people's tendency to defer choice/choose
    not to choose, and to choose 'compromise options.'"

  body: "Peter is perfectly correct.\r\n\r\nThe authors of this study are manipulating
    the font selection to reduce the answerer's confidence: \"Poor fonts reduce fluency,
    increase the feeling of difficulty, and, in turn, lower exam answer confidence.\"\r\n\r\nIn
    this study they used 9 point Tahoma at 100% contrast as their good font and 10
    point Haettenschweiler at 25% contrast as their bad font.\r\n\r\nThe study is
    looking at how confidence impacts intuition. People are more likely to predict
    against their own intuition when their confidence is low.\r\n\r\nFrom the typographic
    perspective it would be interesting to learn if the reduction in contrast or the
    font difference is responsible for the decrease in confidence.\r\n\r\nCheers,
    Kevin\r\n"

    encourages indecision.\r\n\r\nDoesn't sound like faster-is-better is the right
    criteria for assessing readability...unless you want readers to endorse the status
    quo, rather than think for themselves.\r\nThe best thing is type that allows you
    to take your time in fully absorbing what's being said, nothing to do with the
    hard-/easy- to read axis. \r\nThe best thing is type that's easy to read slowly.
    \r\nBut how could that be measured?"

  body: "Thanks everyone,\r\n\r\nI suppose one application of this might be in election
    rigging - if the polls indicate that your candidate is the underdog, then by changing
    the font used by the touch screen voting machines to a hard-to-read font you could
    swing undecided voters towards that candidate. Conversely if your candidate is
    ahead in the polls, using a legible crisp font may reinfoce votes for them. \r\n\r\nCheers,

    the type are so \"buttery\" to read to the point that you end up skipping over
    the words -- conceptually -- and losing comprehension in the process. This is
    true, especially when the materials are to be read in full focus.\r\n\r\nMy case
    has been reading Bringhurst's <em>Elements</em> at 9:45 pm one gloomy Tuesday
    night. Has it been the case with anyone?"
