  body: "Yes, but unfortunately it is the only one available of this font. Also, it
    does not have all the characters that were in the original Motter Hombre. Maybe
    that's why it's an Ombre -- LOL\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nI just noticed it is no longer
    referred to as Motter Ombre - the digital version on dafont is a different one...\r\n\r\nSo
    there is another digital version floating around the net somewhere....\r\n\r\nBTW
    - right here on Typophile you can see the entire character set here:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/5845"
