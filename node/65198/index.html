  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello to All,

I am new to the beauty and complexity of fonts in general and am in no way a professional in that area.  I do not make my money by writing or publishing. As I move along in my self education though, I have run across the history of Palatino.  I understand that the only digitized version of the original of Zapfs masterpiece is to be found on the font CD published by Softmaker.  I also found a thread on this site that discusses this, but it did not answer my questions.  I hope you all can help.

1. The original Palatino (rendered as Palazzo Original from Softmaker) is quite different from later digitized versions.  Although much crisper, the later versions seem less elegant and flowing to my eye.  The gotcha for me is that Palazzo Original was, I believe, digitized without the owners permission (who was the actual owner at this time anyway). Is this accurate?

2. I have purchased Bitstreams collections via Corel and I am very happy with the font quality. For my uses I rarely require ligatures or small caps, so they are fine for me. If I purchase the CD from Softmaker and use Palazzo Original for my own use, is that a violation of copyright or other laws? What about ethically? It is a shame that such a beautiful font has not been digitized by more legitimate means.

3. Since I used Bitsream fonts regularly and there are opinions about their fonts being "rip-offs", where does Softmaker stand?

4. If a font published by a legitimate company is discontinued for some time, can a person or company redistribute the font after a set length time as in copyright law? 

Thanks for your time.

All the Best,
John</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The historical situation, as far I have ascertained it, is as follows:

The defunct H. Berthold AG, in 1992, one year before it went bankrupt in 1993, converted the old 1950 Palatino font, with the permission of Hermann Zapf, to a Postscript font, which is shown and embedded in the PDF scangraphic.pdf (see below) as "Palatino BQ" (see the PDF document properties).

Several other font forging, font cloning and font renaming outfits, among them Scangraphic, Franzis, Softmaker, grapped this Postscript font file "Berthold BQ" after Berthold's bankruptcy and sold it under fancy names, e.g. under the names "Paxim" (Scangraphic), "Palazzo" (Softmaker), "Palmer" (Franzis), etc.

See for example

www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/scangraphic.pdf, page 13

www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/megafont.pdf, page 9

www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/franzis.pdf, page 23

www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/franzis2.pdf, page 42

You may use any of these versions, and also the old Berthold BQ version, for free, but you must not claim to be the copyright owner or the design owner, because the typopgraphical design rights to this 1950 Palatino have fallen into public domain.

Thank you so much for the response; this answers my questions perfectly.


Michael,
I did a quick comparison of the only scan of the 1950 metal typed page that I could find and Palazzo Original. To my untrained eye, they are about as close as fonts can be that are derived from different technology requirements.  I thank you also for your comment; greatly appreciated.

scanned from a mid-1960 book shows 1950 Palatino, which had been typeset in 8 on 10 points and had been printed by letterpress on wove paper. There was virtually no contrast between thin upstrokes and thick downstrokes (e.g. of capital A etc.) in small point sizes.

I would greatly appreciate it if you would post an online repro of Palatino. Any version you deem authentic would be great. Thank you for your forensics on this. My eyes are being educated as we speak; maybe even a little enlightenment is creeping in.

		<div class="commentbody">One other important consideration is that Palatino was originally intended by Zapf to be a display face, although today just about anything with 'palatino' on it is used as a text face.

Zapf's other design, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/aldus/|Aldus]] was intended to be a companion text face to palatino and as I understand it, is somewhat of the equivalent of what might have been called "palatino book." Notice the overall shape of the letters and the fact that there really is only one weight.

		<div class="commentbody">Hello,

Thank you all for your kind and timely comments. I have played with the font Palatino in text using FontForge. Even in text sizes, it reads very well for a display face. It is a hair light, but that is what Aldus was developed to address. This is very good forum with many hands and minds willing to help a neophyte.

I noticed that the question of ethics and legality is a little muddy (at least for me) with various opinions.  To be on the safe side, I will only use the font for my personal use and convert characters to graphics when I embed, which I rarely do.

Uli,
Thanks for the links and documents; they were extremely helpful.

Michael,
Thanks for the education and enlightenment.

All others,
Thanks for the copyright data and the information on Aldus as a text companion to Palatino.

One more thing,
I find Palatino easy to read at text sizes as well as easy on the eyes.  What are your opinions? What publications, books, etc use or have used the original Palatino? How about the original Aldus?

Thanks again,
John

The above scan Enge-Aldus.jpg was drawn from page 13 of the 1967 edition "Linotype Schriften". On page 11 of this same edition, the normal Aldus is also shown.

The very rare "Enge Aldus" was shown for the first time in the 1962 "Linotype Schriftenreigen", but I preferred the 1967 edition for a scan, because it was printed on calendered paper resulting in a better scan. 

The Stempel AG did not make a hand-composition version of Enge Aldus, which was only available for slug casting machine composition, and also only in 9 point ("Borgis") suitable for big novels. If it helps you, I can also upload page 11 of the 1967 book showing the normal Aldus for comparison.

		<div class="commentbody">Very cool indeed. I am only just beginning to look at fonts and their history. I didn't realize the complexity and beauty of that history. Would anyone have any beginners books to recommend on the history of typography? I seem to be hooked; just reel me in.

Was aldus/palatino ever popular as a text combination? If so, what time period? As its popularity waned, what took its place? Thanks.

All the Best,
John

P.S. -- typerror, I just realized that I have been referring to you by your signed name, not your forum name. I didn't mean to offend.  Sorry about that.

		<div class="commentbody">The font file, Palatino BQ from Berthold, would be protected by copyright (for 100 years, as an institutional work - 95 in the U.S.) even if the <em>design</em> has no legal protection. A font file is like a book or a computer program, it has unquestionable and ironclad copyright protection.

Just because Berthold went bankrupt doesn't mean it is an orphan work - presumably one of H. Berthold AG's creditors owns the font. And I'm surprised, therefore, that something so valuable - the only <em>authentic</em> digital version of Palatino - isn't still offered for sale.

Actually, there are enough books out there exhibiting Palatino in hot metal form that I'm surprised, given that there are open-source imitations of Palatino out there, that there isn't a properly done, but legal, swipe of the typeface in a digital font.</div>
