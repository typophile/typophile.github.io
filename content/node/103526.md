body: "Hello everyone. I've been really hunkering down and designing some of my first
  typefaces. I got tired of seeing Copperplate Gothic everywhere, but I also got inspired
  by it. I was hoping to get some honest feedback about the overall design, especially
  the lowercase and numerals.\r\n\r\nI've attached some samples here, but you can
  check out everything over here. [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Applewine-Typeface/5688095]]"

  body: "An august and worthwhile creation.\r\n\r\nStems of |b| and |d| are light
    on the ascender as compared to inside the bowl. |p| and |q| succeed with the reverse
    so you may want to just copy and paste from them.\r\nTerminal of |e| is too prominent
    and pinches it closed; I'd trim off the inner serif (as you have done with |5|).\r\nConsider
    making the crossbar of |t| upturned instead of downturned.\r\n|2| is unbalanced
    and small on top.\r\n|3| is kind of a mess of shape and stroke weight.\r\n\r\nKeep
    at it, I think people are going to want this."

  body: "Thanks for your help, Kevin.\r\n\r\n\u2022 The stems on the |b| and |d| <em>were</em>
    thin compared to the rest of the verticals. Fixed.\r\n\u2022 Agreed on the |e|.
    The terminal has been chopped and now looks more open.\r\n\u2022 The |2| and the
    |3| have been reworked. Looking at the |3|, I suspect the center needs more weight.\r\n\u2022
    I'm on the fence about the crossbar fo the |t|, but I switched it to see what
    it looks like. I like it down, but it doesn't appear to visually 'sag' anymore.\r\n\r\nI've
    been getting some inquiries about if this typeface was for sale, and I thought
    I'd get it into the best shape before making it available to the public. Thanks
    again for your help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ApplewineSpec5_4700.jpg]"

  body: "This is really a nice typeface. \r\n\r\nThe crossbars of both the \"f\" and
    \"t\" bother me, I think they usually go the other way where the curve or slope
    are on the top of the letter rather than the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe down stroke of
    the \"k\" is too thin, it should be the same thickness as the stem.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"3\" does have an odd design to it, but I really like it.\r\n\r\nThe new \"2\"
    is really nice.\r\n\r\nThe \"g\" \"p\" \"q\" and \"P\" seem too wide, they slow
    my eyes down when I'm reading it."

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions and support, Michael. I've made some of the changes
    you suggested. I think things with the |P| will iron themselves out a bit when
    the spacing gets more refined.\r\n\r\nI've also got a sampling of other some punctuation,
    currency marks, and diacritics. I'll be a bit busy for the next few weeks, so
    apologizes if I don't get back to things for a minute.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ApplewineSpec1_3447.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ApplewineSpec2_5858.png]"

  body: "I'm sorry Derek, I didn't express myself well. What I meant about the \"f\"
    and \"t\" where that the cross bar is not usually serifed. Look at how Palatino
    does it. \r\n\r\nI had an image but typophile isn't loading it for some reason
    so this is the best I can do for now.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino/pro-roman/glyphs.html#glyphs/535782/73|Palatino

    of the font itself, but you managed to give it a personal "flavor". http://www.norgesautomaten.cc
