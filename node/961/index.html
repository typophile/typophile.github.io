But one that can be achieved if one proceeds very carefully. <BR> <BR>Of course, the interaction with other characters in the design is highly important.  <BR> <BR>That's not to say that it's more crucial than in faces where there are more 'usual' stem terminations. <BR> <BR>The interaction just needs to be watched carefully, to avoid the optical bounce. In general, if it's not a non-aligning face, and it appears to have noticable bounce, then it would probably be safe to say that it wasn't designed properly. <BR> <BR>Even in faces like our TF Vignette, or another mentioned example, Linotype Banjoman, it's a matter of testing to see how high or low the join ought to be to look most pleasing (most innocuous, really) to the eye. <BR> <BR>I think it can be a very useful affectation. <BR> <BR>However, it seems to me that what the technique can contribute to the lower left corner of b is a more thorny issue.  <BR> <BR>Much more often, if it's not handled well in that very delicate spot, it's easy to permanently wound an entire typeface. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">You know, I completely neglected to mention one of my favorites: <BR> <BR>Ozwald Bruce Cooper's aparently unnamed brush letter (1930), the roman of which is shown on pp.158-159 of 'The Book of Oz Cooper', The Society of Typographic Arts, Chicago, 1949.  <BR> <BR>Done originally just for a 1930 Harper &amp; Brothers book called 'American Alphabets', by Paul Hollister. <BR> <BR>What's especially fascinating about this is how Cooper devised the completely different way of terminal joining.  <BR> <BR>I don't know if there was ever a name assigned to the technique (which seems to be all Cooper's).  <BR> <BR>But it's rather like a negative terminal, or a low terminal. Ending flat (effectively), but with the bowl joining very low away from the x-height.  <BR> <BR>Without sacrificing the round of the bowl (round as in Bernhard Gothic's) at all. Rather, accentuating it. <BR> <BR>Astonishing, really. <BR> <BR>Talk about a set of drawings that'll make your eyes roll back! <BR> <BR>I know that A*I revived it as A*I Oz Brush about 1990. But it appears to be somewhat different from what I can tell from Font Book specimens. Perhaps it's a little haphazard? Hard to tell whether it was fully true to the brushed spontaneity of Cooper's masterpiece. <BR> <BR>I wonder if anyone knows whether Hollister's publishing of his book introducing Cooper's letter predated the release of Bernhard Gothic?  <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR> <BR></div>
