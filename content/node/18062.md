  didn't want to or anything\u2026 I just got too busy. You know, that whole work
  thing.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm starting to shake a little over here and keep checking
  the forum for the specs on the next battle and, well, there has been nothing today.
  I'm getting worried - like It's going to be a long night.\r\n\r\nwassup?\r\n\r\n\u2014pd\u2014"

    too are feeling your pain, it is very busy in Punchcut-land (You know, the whole
    work thing :)) and we'll do our best to get a battle posted today.
