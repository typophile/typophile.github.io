  body: I agree that the sample is hand-drawn, but if you are trying to find similar
    script fonts &#40;casual flowing script&#41;, see <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg7.html"
    target="_blank">Part 7 of the Script Font ID Guide</a>, especially pages 7  to
    10. These are mostly fonts from <a href="http://artandsignstudio.com/fonts.html"
    target="_blank">Art &amp; Sign</a> and <a href="http://www.signdna.com/v2/cart/allfonts.php?id=all&amp;gp=-1"
    target="_blank">SignDNA</a>, and they have a number of heavy flowing script designs
    like this one. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/" target="_blank">Letterhead
    Fonts</a> is also another good source of sign scripts, similar to this one.
