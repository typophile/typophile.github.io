body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nSo I'm a young designer, about two years out of school. I still
  run into a lot of people my age that LOVE to talk about their hate of Sand and Curlz.
  My first guess is that they love the sound of their own voice. My second guess is
  that they love to sound pretentious. I guess this may be a little juvenile to talk
  about, given the contributors here at typophile, but I always had it in the back
  of my mind that perhaps a good typographer could make lead look like gold. I have
  a gut feeling that as awful as some of these typefaces turned out, the designer
  must have known what they were doing.\r\n\r\nDo people really have a right to pan
  these fonts wherever they appear, or do they have places in which they actually
  work? Has anyone here been forced by a client to use one of these \"forbidden\"
  fonts? Why were they created in the first place?\r\n\r\nI would love to see a \"bad\"
  font validated. I know \"bad\" font is somewhat vague, and in the eye of the beholder,
  but I think we all know all the preloaded/bundled display fonts I'm talking about."

    Most of the funky fonts are useful for just a couple of words as a substitute
    for and illustration. To quote Dr. Irwin Corey "Beauty in in the Behind of the
    Beholder".

  body: "I think that ubiquity of misuse can cause a typeface to be bad in any context.
    It is impossible to see typefaces like Sand and Curlz in almost any context without
    naturally making the connection with flyers for barbeques and things like that.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'm more interested in is whether typefaces that are not novelty faces but are
    still considered bad, like Arial, have any sort of effective use."

  body: "It is too easy for people to bond by attacking an easy target. Ever hear
    old men hate on Hillary? People can be on the same team if they can identify a
    common enemy. It is just a social nervousness. \r\n\r\nEverything is a tool. The
    second something is perceived as useless or wrong it gains some power. That power
    can be useful. Our industry tends to be very derivative, with set concepts of
    what is good. If you can cut against the grain and make something undeniable in
    its appeal that is off trend, you may find you have created a new trend."

    here, but a little addition on this point. I don't think so. A good typographer
    can sometimes allow an appreciation of lead. But it is touchy, the same as using
    a visual pun that many readers won't get. Successfully tarting something up has
    to follow the first rule of medicine: do no harm. If you can achieve that and
    add to the enjoyment of those when appreciate your pun -- or use of lead -- you're
    a good typographer."

  body: 'Avante Garde is a good example of a typeface that was verboten when I was
    in school, but recently found a revival by those who discovered its excellent
    alternates and unique ligatures set. It went from being a bad substitute for Futura,
    to being a dynamic display face (as was intended). It''s now a trendy typeface
    that pops up all over. I''m not sure that Papyrus will ever get to that point,
    but who knows? Sometimes it takes one clever designer to help the rest of us to
    see with unbiased eyes. Another example is Dave Eggers'' <em>McSweeney''s</em>
    using Times New Roman on its cover in an intriguingly complex design. TNR isn''t
    bad, just often abused and as common as dirt. And now that design aesthetic has
    been reproduced by other designers. '
