  body: Could be a condenced <a href="http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/">Akkurat
    Leicht</a>. The only obvious difference I see at first glance is the curve of

  body: I don't think that's Akkurat. Esp the numerals are quite different; also,
    look at the difference of the crossbar lengths in the E; and even in a squooshed
    version I don't think Akkurat's S would end up with such an unharmonic diagonal.
    I'm unsure what it could be, though.

    Grotesk]], but the rest of the letters look more like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/news-gothic/|News
    Gothic]], slightly squooshed, although the J is not right. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/basic-commercial-lt/light/|Basic
    Commercial Light]] is a fairly close match too (based on AG, I believe).\r\n\r\n-
