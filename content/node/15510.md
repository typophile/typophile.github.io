  Hoefler Text<strong> at a fairly big size. Looking through them, I discovered the
  then </strong>Hoefler Type Foundry<strong> logo mirrored in one of the letter slots,
  as I assumed a wink to previous printing techniques.\r\n\r\nI'm curious if any of
  You have designed or found hidden logos, licence numbers, messages or any such like
  in your work or others, subversive or not.\r\n\r\nAlso, with OpenType and coding
  the possibilities of hiding things that suddenly, like a Trojan horse. I don't know
  how to code obviously, but imagine if someone wants to write <cite>NELSON MANDELA
  MUST DIE</cite> and contextual ligatures turns it into <cite>I WANT TO HUG KOALA
  BEARS</cite>.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n\u0192"

  body: "If you are running MacOS X, try setting the word \"Zapfino\" in Zapfino using
    TextEdit. It's most fun if you do it one letter at a time.\r\n\r\nI have heard
    of OT fonts with similar easter eggs. I think Underware's Bello is one of them,
    but I don't have the font and don't remember what it did.\r\n\r\nEdit: Go to the
    Type Tester on the Underware site (http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=bello&id2=testbello)
    and type \"Underware\". It's possible this only works in the Type Tester."

  body: Also, the Apple logo character is often replaced by something else. Since
    the Apple logo is trademarked, only Apple is legally entitled to include it. I
    usually put a picture of an apple there in the style of the font. Some foundries
    put their logo there.

  body: i thought it'd be fun to throw easter eggs in OT fonts, but you can't really
    hide anything in a glyph pallette... so they wouldn't be like DVD easter eggs
    where you hafta stumble upon them or know how to access them. kinda kills the
    fun of it...

    body: Could you just break the easter egg up into multiple individually incoherent
      glyphs which make sense when properly combined via contextual features? (Along
      with decoys?)

    palette. I think it's hidden enough.

  body: Stephen, Adobe makes the glyph pallet very clear in InDesign and Illustrator.
    I wouldn't use an Open Type font without referencing the glyph pallet if I was
    creating a logo.

  body: Oh, I wouldn't either. It's always open on my workspace. But you and I are
    more informed than most. I've clued in a lot of very bright people about the Glyph
    Palette who were formerly struggling to find font extras. It's still a fairly
    new concept to oldschoolers.

    this type of font behavior replacing bad words.\r\n\r\nI recall seeing an OpenType
    font by Geraldine Wade c.1996 which replaced animal names with pics of the animals
    - eg. \"unicorn\" with a pic of a unicorn. I'm sure there were similar fonts in
    GX and related technology pre-dating this.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si "
