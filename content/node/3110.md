  body: What kind of wine? <BR>But in general I find Octavian very suitable, especially
    the italic. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

- body: Being somewhat of a <i>non-connaisseur</i> when it comes to wine I tend to
    buy wine strictly with special kind of labels, i.e. not with your average winetypography.
    There&#39;s also certain themes i try, like  <BR><i>Oh, for this weekend I&#39;ll
    only buy wine with illustrations of elks</i>. <BR>You&#39;d be surprised how many
    there are &#40;at least two&#41;. <BR> <BR>Anyway, if you really care, and want
    to do some generic wine label typography, go to a Shop Where They Sell Wine and
    take a Good Look. <BR> <BR>Ask yourself what kind of approach you want. Simple
    elegance, like a chanel perfume bottle, or is it something less classy? Fraktur?  Hand
    lettering, something that wraps around the bottle?   <BR>What kind of wine would
    <i>You</i> like to buy? <BR> <BR>Maybe you shouldn&#39;t concentrate on the typography,
    but instead focus on an illustration on the bottle, of, say, an elk? <BR> <BR>
    <BR>Best of luck, <BR> <BR>

  body: 'What is the name of the wine or winery. There is a South American wine named
    Gato. Blanco and Negro, so the main theme is a Cat. So type doesn&#39;t necessarly
    drive the theme of a label. '

  body: I&#39;d also add that it would worth some time to look elsewhere for inspiration.
    You might be surprised at what you would find at, say, an auto parts store that
    could inform type selection on a wine bottle.

  body: I recently bought a bottle of Brothers In Arms No. 6 [<a href="http://brothersinarms.com.au/wine/Number6/index.asp"
    target="_blank">http://brothersinarms.com.au/wine/Number6/index.asp</a>] and I&#39;d
    say my trigger was the unusual use of typography on the label. I&#39;ve also found
    myself buying other unfamiliar wines because of this. <BR> <BR>btw - the No. 6
    was deelish...

  body: Well, i think is a nice logo anyway. And the fact that it is a redrawn letter
    makes you pay attention to the detail. I&#39;m sure nobody would have thought
    that a Goudy &#34;g&#34; was used because of the DO of the wine. <BR>Respect to
    the helv
