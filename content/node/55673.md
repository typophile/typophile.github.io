  that will be posted in the next few days as everyone recovers from the (exhausting)
  3 day event.\r\n\r\nfor those with flickr accounts you can add your photos to the
  Robothon group:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/robothon09/\r\n\r\nHere are a few
  of the Robothon recaps I have found, please add more if you know of any.\r\n\r\nRob
  Keller's coverage: <a href=\"http://www.youshouldliketypetoo.com/showcase/robothon-2009/\">here.</a>\r\n\r\nDan
  Reynolds writes about his experience at the conference <a href=\"http://www.typeoff.de/?p=504\">here.</a>\r\n\r\nRicardo
  Lafuente has some very in-depth posts about Robothon <a href=\"http://tinkerhouse.net/log/?s=Robothon\">here</a>\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAfter
  Robothon the fourth Gerrit Noordzij exhibition was opened, the exhibition of the
  work of Tobias Frere-Jones was accompanied by a <a href=\"http://abiabiabi.com/index.php?/project/tobias-frere-jones-catalogue/\">catalogue</a>
  which was given out at the opening and will be sold by the publisher: Uitgeverij
  de Buitenkant. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/tobiasfrerejonesgerritnoordzijprizeexhibition/\">Some
  exhibiton images here,</a> more soon.\r\n\r\nThe Tobias Frere-Jones exhibition also
  made it on to the <a href=\"http://www.rtl.nl/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/miMedia/2009/week10/vr_1930_letters.avi_plain.xml\">news</a>\r\n\r\nOn
  Saturday was a short seminar on the occasion of the Gerrit Noordzij prize and Paul
  Barnes, Rich Roat, Chris Vermaas, Tobias Frere-Jones and Piet Schreuders (followed
  by a performance by the Beau Hunks). I'm sure Erik will post a link to the video
  clips of the Robothon and Gerrit Noordzij prize lectures here as soon as they are
  up.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nLate that night there was small gathering of Type and Media
  students, Type and Media alumni and some friends from Reading. Some fun was had
  with the coasters that were on the table: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/katanan/3341378046/\">here</a>
