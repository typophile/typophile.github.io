  body: "Thanks for those Miguel and Fredo, they all look great, but i feel a bit
    scared! :)\r\n\r\nNow, do you know any graphic design studios with a strong typographic
    approach or whose typography is remarkable???   i mean their use and application
    of type rather than their designed custom faces... (for that the posts from Miguel
    and Fredo are perfect)  \r\n\r\nI feel a bit intimidated by the typography studios,
    (i don't know that much about type) i think i rather start in a graphic design
    studio where the expectations about my knowledge of type won't be as high... Besides,
    i don't know if i have that much to offer back in a studio where they strictly
    design type!!!\r\n\r\nI'll be waiting for your recommendations\r\nThanks!"
