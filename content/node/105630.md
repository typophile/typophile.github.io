  trying to make a new member tag based on this image, and others like it. Unfortunately,
  someone else made this image, and I have no idea what that font is. I've tried automated
  font recognition already and searching through all the default fonts with no luck.\r\n\r\nSave
  me, hahaha. The Forum lead Administrator is a good friend of mine, and I really
  wanna do this right for him."
