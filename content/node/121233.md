  body: "Little too small to be absolutely sure, but it looks very much like a regular
    weight of Frutiger's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/|Avenir]].\r\n\r\nTry
    the 55 (Roman) or 65 (Medium)."

title: This font has been used from a card designer and he vanished. I tried many
  Arial fonts and none matches exactly, am I guessing right or this is not an Arial
  font at all?
