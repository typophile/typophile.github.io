body: "I'm doing a business card job that will be printed letterpress on a very tactile
  paper stock. I'm looking for advice on what typestyles tend to work best in that
  medium. Do high contrast styles like didones work well or should I stick to low
  contrast styles.\r\n\r\nThe client is interested in Niagara. Will an engraved style
  like that print properly in this context?\r\n\r\nI guess the crux of my question
  is whether letterpress can handle fine lines.\r\n\r\nThanks."
