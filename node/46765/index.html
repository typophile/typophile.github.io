  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been playing around with a Wacom tablet lately, figuring that it would be a lot less time consuming if I used one for projects. Seeing that the one I&rsquo;m borrowing is making my life a whole hell of a lot easier, I&rsquo;ve decided to buy one. Being that I&rsquo;m paying for collage by myself, along with a house note, car note, etc&hellip;I really can&rsquo;t afford an expensive one. Any suggestions on a practically priced one for a person in my shoes? I do mostly mock up web pages, creations in photo shop&hellip;etc</p>

<p>I have had students who love them, so much so that even I was (almost) convinced.  The ones I have been shown (sorry, I don&rsquo;t know the brand or product #) was not that bad, between $100 and $200.00.  But that was a year ago.</p>
<p>This is an interesting idea and I am curious what the Typophiles think.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Wacom tablets rule and I don&rsquo;t know how anyone can work without one. Mice suck for your hands. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t see any reason to go with anything other than the most modest version. The bells and whistles just aren&rsquo;t necessary. Both of mine (work and home) are from before the days of the &ldquo;bamboo&rdquo; models, or whatever it is they&rsquo;re calling it these days, but they are the lowest end, 4 x 5, and function perfectly. I should buy stock in that company, come to think of it. If only I could afford to buy stock in anything!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I use the Wacom Intuos 3. Its fabulous.</p>
<p>When I upgraded my computer a few years ago I first tried the Graphire, a cheaper version by Wacom. That was a big mistake! It didn&rsquo;t have very accurate control and was frustrating to use. I ended up biting the bullet and going for the Intuos and it works wonderfully.</p>
<p>The intuos comes with a mouse also that sits on the tablet and works great for web browsing and such. It has a scroll wheel in the center of rt./ lft. buttons. On the sides are buttons that will go forward or backward with web pages. In FontLab these buttons will let you do the same with glyph windows. I do a lot of Photoshop work with lettering and the pen tool is perfect for getting in tight place and touching up. If you do very much Photoshop drawing, it will pay for itself in time saved.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I actually ended up ordering one after some suggestions from my friends. It&rsquo;s one of the bamboo wacom&rsquo;s..it comes with the photoshop software, pen, and mouse&hellip;99bucks. Everyone I talked to say that for the money, it works extremely well. hopefully within a few days I&rsquo;ll be able to try it out and give y&rsquo;all some feed back.<img src="/images/old-images/base_media_4678.jpg" alt=""></div>
