  restored.  Before it gets stripped and re-painted, I want to make sure that these
  fonts can be identified so that I can make some paint masks and put them back on
  looking exactly how they did 100 years ago when this thing was manufactured (actually
  I really have no idea how old this safe is, but the customer is saying that it is
  about that old).\r\n\r\nAny help that can be offered to me is greatly appreciated,
  as otherwise I will probably have to go through and vectorize it all--I really don't
  want to have to do that.\r\n\r\nThank You.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN2769a_4231.jpg]"

    then clean it up

    really don't relish doing it that way and my client really won't like paying me
    for the time that will be involved with doing the lettering that way.  But, you
    are right, that is the only way to guarantee that it is as close to the original
    as possible.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Mike, One thing that will make the tracing easier and better is to do repair
    work in PhotoShop before you trace - missing areas can be quickly filled in etc.

    shortly and see what I can make work and then probably begin the vectorizing process.
    \ I will use the advice that you gave to fill in the missing areas in Photoshop
    before I bring it into my vector art program to do all the hard work.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again, this forum is a great resource!"
