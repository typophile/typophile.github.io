    give away the bitmap-only version, get people hooked, and charge for the version
    that has outlines with the bitmaps embedded. <BR> <BR>This is yet another way
    that bitmaps are superior to &#91;delta-&#93;hinting. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    editing or copy-fitting&#41; without having to  <BR>procure additional licenses.
    <BR> <BR>I hadn&#39;t thought of the potential application for  <BR>Web use. <BR>
    <BR>I do think, however, that in order for mass  <BR>adoption &#40;to the level
    of Verdana, Arial, Times  <BR>and Georgia&#41; the font needs to come pre-installed  <BR>on
    an OS or bundled with a browser. '

  body: ' I don&#39;t/can&#39;t know when Spiekermann had the idea, but I&#39;ve been
    saying it on-and-off here-and-there for about 2 years now. <BR> <BR>The impediments:
    <BR>1. The main ground in bitmap font design is already saturated - innovations
    like Jens&#39;s NNF cannot have great penetration in the mainstream. <BR>2. The
    next leap in bitmap design seems to still be unimplementable, technically - even
    BitFonter falters there. <BR> <BR>&#62; only a font&#39;s outlines are propietary
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure what you mean. Are bitmaps not legally protected, maybe
    because they&#39;re not &#34;software&#34;, and for some strange reason outline
    fonts are? Not that our legal systems &#40;especially the one in the US&#41; make
    any sense, but I think at best this is a gray area, especially when you consider
    that increasingly just plain data &#40;like in a database&#41; is starting to
    be seen as Intellectual Property. <BR> <BR>In any case, since the bitmaps in a
    font cannot be easily extracted &#40;certainly not if it&#39;s done through delta-hinting&#41;,
    this is a moot point. There has to be a multiple-version scheme - and naming gets
    tricky there, btw. <BR> <BR>hhp '
