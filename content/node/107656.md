  Siddur Project</a>, we've received a handful of requests for Unicode Hebrew fonts
  with interesting ligatures that I've seen in print but never before in a digital
  (Unicode) font.\r\n\r\nThe first is a bowing lamed. The second is a letter hey wherein
  the divine name \u05D0\u05D3\u05D5\u05E0\u05D9 (adonai, lit. lord/master) is spelled.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone seen a Unicode font with such ligatures? I'd also be interested in learning
  about Hebrew fonts supporting other unusual ligatures (in the private use area,
  I imagine).\r\n\r\nThank you."

    \u05D4\u05E9\u05C1\u05DD under the \u05D4? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LORD

    need  is a \u05D4 with the right width and the ability to position strings. With
    TeX based editors you can write \u05D0\u05D3\u05E0\u05D9 with a smaller font and
    use \\kern to move it where you want. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/longhe_4269.png]"

  body: "Thank you, Michel. \r\n\r\nHowever, a TeX based solution is simply not practical
    while preparing Jewish liturgical texts in word processing applications that already
    conveniently support BIDI, RTL and Hebrew text with proper diacritic positioning
    (such as LibreOffice). \r\n\r\nDavkaWriter's proprietary (non-Unicode) fonts provide
    such a glyph. From what I've seen it's always addressed at U+00E6 (Latin Small
    Letter Ae).\r\n\r\nWhat's needed is an open source Unicode Hebrew font with such
    a ligature in its Private Use Area.\r\n\r\n[[http://opensiddur.org/wp-content/images/yichud-hey.png]]\r\n\r\nAbove
    is an example from the font KerenG found in its character table at 0x8DFD."

    a ligature shouldn't it be treated as such using the appropriate Opentype feature?"

    features\u2026\r\nBut from what I understand, there are features like Historical
    Ligatures (hlig) and Historical Forms (hist) which can be better suited for giving
    access to such glyphs, rather than adding them in the PUA (also ensuring the readability
    of the text in case a different font is used).\r\nI know of two primers on OpenType
    features:\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/OpenType/opentype-features.html\r\nhttp://opentypecookbook.com\r\nBut
    for any further technical questions, the best place is probably the Build section
