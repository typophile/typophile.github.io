body: 'I just found this forum and boy am I lovin it. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the
  only branding nut out there. I will probably utilize this board some as I am kinda
  an island to myself at my job and don&#39;t really get much extra creative input.
  Anyway - here is one that I just wrapped up - I just want to get some feedback on
  it. <BR> <BR>The company sells a couple of very specific software suites &#40;ComputerEase
  - an accounting software and LaserFiche - a document management software&#41; does
  networking, and sells some hardware. They came with more of a blaze orange color
  in their design history and a logo that was pretty dated. <BR> <BR>I wanted to subtly
  enforce the idea of a computer screen through the shapes in that particular font.  I
  also wanted the logo to show support and partnership &#40;the m and v were a bonus&#41;
  as they move into a consultancy role. We also use that shape repetitively on some
  pieces as a pattern &#40;see folder&#41; and some broad solids of the orange and
  blue. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40471.jpg"

  body: 'Some points to consider, though I haven&#39;t studied you mark more closely:
    <BR> <BR>1 <BR>On the whole, it looks nice, clean and professional. <BR> <BR>2
    <BR>It may, looking at the arrangement on the whole, seem a little dated. I&#39;m
    not sure what exactly is the reason. It may have something to do with the type.
    You know, Microgramme, Eurostile and the like are very much 60ish. They are being
    used again and thus they are also 00ish &#40;possibly 90ish&#41;. I like your
    font, but they way you have arranged it, it kind of resembles the sixties. Consider
    the symbol/type size/relationship. -- &#40;This may be a personal thing for me
    ... would like to have others commenting on this] <BR> <BR>3 <BR>The version displayed
    at the top, with the symbol centered over a point between &#39;MICRO&#39; and
    &#39;VISIONS&#39; &#40;and thus asymetrical] is not so pleasing. Either center
    it or make it flush left IMO. <BR> <BR>4 <BR>Have you considered making M and
    MICRO &#40;and V and VISIONS&#41; the same colour? <BR> <BR>5 <BR>On the whole,
    I think you design too &#39;nicely&#39; ... I would to see something organic as
    a contrast, something wild. Maybe one of the two colours should be contrasting
    in tonality, something should be shown in fragment ... or something like that.
    <BR> <BR>6 <BR>I don&#39;t like, on the stationary items -- the brown part --
    the way the screen shape has been put into another screen shape. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren

  body: I love it... great stuff! My only quibble is that Mata has kinda been over-exposed
    due to it being the titling font for Spider-Man 2. And if you&#39;ve been to a
    grocery store or retail store recently &#40;in America&#41; you may have noticed
    that Sony has licensed the movie up the yahoo, from clothes to cereal to popcorn.
    <BR> <BR>But it works so well with the shape of the logo!

  body: I&#39;d agree about the logo inside the logo-shape. That&#39;s a tad too much.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a decent, nice logo. The only issue I have is that it doesn&#39;t
    seem balanced as if the logo mark is shifting to the left compared to the type
    below.

  body: In accordance with the rest of the postings here, I&#39;m not crazy about
    the unbalanced logotype placement. It either needs to be centered, or offset,
    but not sort of centered. <BR> <BR>The various printed pieces are faithful to
    the general identity/brand, but it looks like there wasn&#39;t as much design
    sensitivity as was given to the logo itself. Some of the pieces are too close
    to the edges of the page, the type is set without attention to relativity, I think
    a better font could be used &#40;refering to the info type&#41;. This kit cover/presentation
    folder in particular is a pretty nice piece, but I don&#39;t think the logo framed
    in white is working

  body: Wow - thanks for the feedback guys - I hear what you&#39;re saying - we went
    round and round with the logo placement centered versus centered over the break
    in type versus left aligned &#40;I particularly liked one version where the logo
    was not as near to the type and was  NW  of where it is now, but not aligned -
    I know I&#39;m explaining that all wrong&#41; and in the end I got outmaneuvered
    - I warned them that it would create all sorts of issues down the road, but instead
    we will be utilizing the other two versions as well to try and even it out throughout
    the adwork etc. <BR> <BR>As far as  the other pieces, thse guys are VERY straight
    laced - it was a lot of work on the part of myself and the marketing director
    to get the owners this far down the road. <BR> <BR>The original mark didn&#39;t
    have the blue outline around the triangle and &#34;M&#34; shape and we went back
    and forth on that to bring out the white MV in the negative space - still not
    sure if we made the right decision on that. <BR> <BR>Soren - the whole sixties
    thing - I think I was channeling the spirit of a textile designer from the sixties
    or maybe just waiting on my new Todd Oldham Snap Sofa - but I wish I could have
    taken it a little more funky - but believe me this is as far as they would budge,
    but I was actually going for a little of that - hope it wasn&#39;t a bad choice
    - time will tell. What parts are you talking about logo within a logo &#40;the
    cover of the folder?&#41; Yeah I kinda thought so to once it was done - hindsight
    and good friends are 20/20. Originally that layout was conceived before the blue
    outline was around the mark and they wanted to keep it that way - we did a couple
    of other versions with the horizontal version &#40;which because of the balance
    issue has become my favorite&#41; but this was what we landed on. <BR>Are you
    also talking about the color bars at the top of the pieces repeating that shape?
    <BR> <BR>Scott - Tell me more - what you are knocking at is exactly the kind of
    critique I would like - some of those small details are things I think I miss
    after looking at it for a long period of time. As far as the font - let me just
    say I had to talk them out of Arial - twice. But I am curious what would you suggest
    and is there a particualr aspect that makes them incongruant? Again - I&#39;m
    just here for the advice &#40;wink wink&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks all the info - it
    may be too late to change this one, but I can use it on my next few projects.
    I have a couple of others that are wrapped that I felt in the end were missing
    just one more level of polish and a critical eye. Plus now I can fly some new
    things by some folks that will do more than just say - that&#39;s it run with
    it {rolls eyes}. <BR> <BR>Oh and sorry for the double post - hopefully the moderator
    gods will blend them. <BR> <BR>Now that I&#39;ve rambled enough - Thanks guys
    - looking forward to more!
