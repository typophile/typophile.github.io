  whether it be the design of the site or the designer themselves?

  body: "I like the way Pentagram displays their portfolio (pentagram.com). It's right
    there on the home page, interesting design, click a thumb to see more, can filter
    by category, etc.\r\n\r\nIt's surprising to me how often design firms (especially
    smaller ones and freelancers) display their portfolios poorly, probably because
    they're so busy meeting client deadlines that they don't get around to working
    on their own sites. (The old \"the cobbler's children have no shoes\" principle.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pentagram_4018.jpg]"
