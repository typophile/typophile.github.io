  \r\nI have been having an issue with Indesign and PDF files\r\n\r\nWe are getting
  font character \"Glyphs replacing other characters\"\r\n\r\nSpecs of the machines\r\n\r\nMac
  OsX=10.5.8\r\n\r\nID version=ID-CS5 ver 7.0.3\r\n\r\nAcrobat Distiller version =
  8.0\r\n\r\n \r\nFonts we have had this issue with\r\n\r\nSabon LT Std.\r\n\r\nGaramond
  MT Regular\r\n\r\nFairfield LT STD\r\n\r\nTimesLT Std\r\n\r\nPalatino LT Std\r\n\r\nMinion
  Pro Regular\r\n\r\nVerdana Italic\r\n\r\nTimes New Roman PS\r\n\r\nAdobe Garamond
  Pro Regular\r\n\r\nCresci Regular\r\n \r\nCharacters that have been causing the
  issues.\r\n\r\nio, il, hn, hk, SY \r\n\r\n \r\nThe characters they are replaced
  with.\r\n\r\n\xDA \u0178 \xD5 \u0160 \u1EF2 \xA7\r\n\r\n \r\nWe run font cache cleaners
  such as Font Nuke, Font smasher and we even created our own from information found
  in other places where all the font cache's hide as well as suitcase's.\r\n\r\nWe
  tend to catch this issue in out PDF outputbut it does show up in the Indesign files.
  We have noticed that when we catch it in the Indesign file we can turn of ligatures
  in the Paragraph style and the characters go back to how they should display. But
  then the fi, fl, ffi, ffl, and Th ligatures are gone in the paragraph.\r\n\r\nWe
  process many jobs on a given day via 3 different machines that are setup to create
  PDF files. On total we do about 170 new jobs in a month this doesn't count revisions
  of the job and since August we have only discovered it in 11 jobs.\r\n\r\nOther
  people are having similar problems but similar to our issue its not something one
  can replicate all the time.\r\nPlease see the following link to the adobe forums.\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/message/4084426#4084426\r\n\r\n\r\nLink
  to the image of the issue on Adobe forums.\r\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/message/4093188#4093188\r\n\r\n
  \r\nThank you \r\nMatt"
