  qualified to serve the font industry, is teaching a workshop and a breakout session
  at TypeCon this year. I am excited to be able to sit down and hear about these processes
  directly from the horses mouth. It seems to me that in this day and age with all
  of the piracy that is going on something like this can only help us arm ourselves
  with the needed information to protect our work. I personally can't wait. Who else
  is attending these two sessions?\r\n\r\nFYI, here's the info for those who weren't
  aware!\r\n\r\nWorkshop: \r\nCopyright Protection for Graphic Designers and Font
  Foundries: Myth and Reality\r\nPresented by Frank Martinez (The Martinez Group)\r\nThursday,
