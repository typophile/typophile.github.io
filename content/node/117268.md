  on old printing press(not letter press though). A search of antique printing press
  forums, produces no sites with forums. The printing press museums don't do any actually
  printing of the antique machines. Here is the problem.\r\n\r\nWe are interested
  in having some Prints made from book art, about 2000 prints in total. What we are
  doing; Dan Maitz, Dave Seeley, Stephen Youll , Stephan Martiniere \"The Kings of
  Fantasy Art\" and I, Mr. T. Stout are trying to collaborate on a project from a
  novel, that involves each artist doing a piece of art inspired by the book The Vampire
  and The Rainbow. We wanted to make 500 copies of each artists work to be autographed.
  We also wanted to print to be something special, very unique, or something very
  unusual. \r\n\r\nWhat we would like to know is, what are some special, unique, or
  very unusual printing processes ( printing by direct electricity or on metal sheets,
  etc.... Not just antique print(unless very rare) we want something special for the
  fans. Also if anyone can direct us to any forums, persons, or companies that could
  help us to complete this printing project.\r\n\r\nThank in advance for any help.

    it'll be? Line drawings? Water colors? Oil paintings? Photographs? \r\n\r\nYou'll
    want to pick a method that reproduces the art accurately, or at least inform the
    artists before they make the artwork about the printing method. Otherwise you'll
    get a lot of angry artists."
