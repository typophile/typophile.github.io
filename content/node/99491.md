  save family variants of a font? Let's say I wanna make a bold version of a font...
  do I save it as a separated file? Do I save the bold versions in new glyph cells?
  What do I do?"

  body: "Each additional weight and style will require its own unique font file. Ideally
    you would then connect them through the naming metadata, which when set up correctly
    will build the relationship in different operating systems and applications.\r\n\r\nThe
    guides from [[http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=313.0|Adam Twardoch]] and
    [[http://www.kltf.de/downloads/FontNaming-kltf.pdf|Karsten Luecke]] are invaluable
    resources for how to set up this metadata in the most stable way across as many
    environments as possible.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the FontLab manual is an incredible
    resource, not only relating to the software but to more general principals of
    digital type design as well."
