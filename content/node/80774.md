  with finding a comprehensive system of templates that are well designed, use consistent
  typography in guideline notation and annotation systems across all templates, and
  can double for presentation in brand guidelines documents.\r\n\r\nWhether a commercial
  product or free resource, do any of you know of something like this?\r\n\r\nThanks!

    for presentation purposes, or for preparing artwork for the printer? There's a
    big difference in many cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, an envelope template for the
    printer would probably have the envelope in its unfolded state with all the glue
    flaps opened and the back side upside down relative to the front. In other words,
    the shape of the envelope before it is printed, die cut, glued and folded. But
    in a template for presentation purposes the envelope's shape might be represented
    by a simple rectangle.\r\n"
