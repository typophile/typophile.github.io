body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_2107_3555.JPG]\r\n\r\nThis is found
  in Vintage International (a division of Penguin Random House)\u2019s first print
  of Nabokov\u2019s <i>Pale Fire</i> novel, paperback. The poem was printed in this
  beautiful transitional, and the commentary was printed in Baskerville. I\u2019ve
  been looking for this typeface for very long. The awkwardly large space between
  some capitals and small letters make me suspect it\u2019s hand set metal type."
