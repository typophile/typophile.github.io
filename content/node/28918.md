body: "I am soon to be putting together an identity for a company that manufactures
  novelty putty, along similar lines to the 'Silly Putty' that has been around for
  a number of years. Their putty does clever things like change colour and comes in
  a range of colours including metallic and fluorescent.\r\n\r\nThey are hoping to
  retail directly via the web, through multiples such as Toys 'R' Us, and as promotional
  corporate items.\r\n\r\nSo I'm looking for suggestions for typefaces that have an
  appealing, putty-like feel yet still have enough dignity to hold their head up in
  a corporate environment. It's a tough one I know...\r\n\r\nRunning text will not
  be an issue as the typeface will be purely for logo/display use. Sorry to be so
  vague but the name is yet to be decided\r\n\r\nThank you "
