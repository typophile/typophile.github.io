body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a somewhat modern sans-serif that will go well with
  a round symbol.\r\n\r\nThe company gives out certificates in drug prescription and
  dozage to nurses. I don't want a type that has one side too thin. Right now I'm
  using Utopia, it has a nice thickness too it but it looks too ordinary. Would be
  could if it had nice small caps aswell.\r\n\r\nI'd like to try various versions
  with more and less notable serifs.\r\n\r\nI could poosibly use a sans type too but
  it can't be to soft.\r\n\r\nOr maybe some slab serifs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks\r\npeter"

  body: If the Client won't go for $130 for type then get some new clients. You designer
    guys have to get a little more creative selling type to your clients. Otherwise
    you'll be stuck with the same old fonts.

  body: "From the two named above I\u2019d definitely prefer Alfon.\r\nInteresting,
    yet, a touch too decorative in my eyes, for example the g.\r\n\r\nI have got to
    know Lexicon no2 recently. Maybe someone wouldn\u2019t call it modern in a strict
    sense, yet, for me it is.\r\nBut attention, I think it costs a lot more! ;-)\r\nAnd
    I believe its worth it.\r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: Im not a hudge fan of Emigre but they have some really nice modern serifs.
    Try Vendetta, Tribute or Filosophia.
