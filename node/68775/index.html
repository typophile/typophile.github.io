  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Woah, it's been a while since I've been on here!

I've recently been checking out/using the Droid font (Google's android OS font) in a current project. Could anyone recommend an alternative which is easy to read, that has both a serif and sans serif version?

(It's main use in the project will be for a design research summary document that will be available online (for visitors/potential clients to download and print), or printed and sent out).

Look forward to your suggestions!

Cheers in advance,
G</div>

If you want optimal presentation for both mediums - screen and print - include a print stylesheet that re-formats and uses a print font(s). Those are going to be much easier to find. Top-notch screen fonts that are readable at body text sizes are still a comparatively rare breed.
You might want to look into Ascender's new font service and use one of the ClearType fonts (and there are others to choose from too.) It's inexpensive, but you can have the pleasure of paying for the ClearType fonts all over again.

If you are talking about using Droid, I am assuming you're thinking of linking the fonts using @font-face. Or are you talking PDF? In which case Droid doesn't make a lot of sense to begin with.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your reply Richard, certainly a lot to think about!

Granted screen fonts aren't great on paper by their nature, so I agree about it's potential as a print font. However, the project isn't going live for a few months (around May/June) so we're looking towards the Pro version of Droid (which is on its way) for print. This will be used in a PDF document, rather than linking the fonts (or including a print stylesheet). I should have mentioned that in the initial post!

Although the online presence is [currently] in Droid, the PDF summary documents could be set in something different. But I was wondering what other font families have both a serif and sans serif version? I couldn't think of any off the top of my head, and still can't.</div>

Corporate is looking like an option. If there was a 'solved' button, I would click it.</div>
