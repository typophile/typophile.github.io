  body: 'Greg, keep off the caffine, it only gets easier. Try tea, it has caffine
    but it also has chemicals in it that counteract the caffine''s effect. This summer
    I always had Ice tea and Lemonade (homemade) in the frigerator. Also drink lots
    of water. Coffee with caffine hasn''t passed my lips in 3+ years. '
