  year, got out pronto. Well, not \"got out\"--it was so boring that I simply forgot
  about journalism and took nothing but liberal arts courses from then on. But one
  journalism course I loved was basic typography: we were led into a basement shop
  and turned loose on California job cases, printers' knots, solid-brass \"sticks\"
  and pica gauges, and clamshell presses. In short, it was a too-short course on setting
  type by hand, and I loved it. One thing that has stuck with me all these years is
  the rule or notion that for each size of type there is an ideal or maximum column
  width beyond which legibility suffers. I used to have a sheet that gave the ideal
  width for each of a dozen or so fairly common type sizes, and I will be grateful
  to anyone who can steer me to a replacement.\r\n\r\nI mention this because it seems
  to me to be be common magazine practice nowadays to set type too wide. For example,
  in the re-designed NYTimes Sunday Magazine, columns in the same-size type (looks
  like 9-point) are sometimes 15 picas wide and other times 23. The latter are (to
  me) far less readable than the former. I'm convinced that 23 picas is significantly
  beyond the \"ideal\" width, and I want to confirm my impression.\r\n\r\nAny help
  will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n(FYI, I liked proofreading, too, and in my professional
  life once caught a wrong-font period on an upside-down mechanical. I did not, however,
  find any use for my skill in hadset type. By the time I graduated the publishing
  world had graduated too, into the new world of high tech: Linotype machines!)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I not sure about any hard and fast rule. The closest one I remember is Edmund
    Arnold's (I think) rule that the ideal length of line could be found by using
    1.5 to 2.5 lower case alphabets (39 to 65 characters in a line). The lower range
    was for newspapers, and many books will be set with the higher range.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It is difficult to appropriately define a universal set of rules for this
    because not another factor that needs to be put into consideration is the typeface
    itself and the colours used (eg.is it white type on black background). Edmund
    Arnold's rule only applies to newspaper publishings where there is a constant
    use of typeface, in which case it was Times and Bureau Grotesk during his work
    with newspapers such as the Boston Globe and National Observer.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    i was once told by my typography lecturer that there is a mathematical formula
    that is used to work this out for each typeface that takes into account the X-height,
    cap height and baseline. But I failed to remember it.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the
    best way of choosing the correct column width is by trial and error. To print
    variations and deciding on the best one. Or I might be wrong and rambling for
    no reason. =p"

    Felici</a>:</dt></dl>\r\n<dd></dd>\r\n<dd><strong>Point Size & Measure</strong></dd></dl>\r\n<dl><dd></dd></dl>\r\n<dd>Point
    size and measure are married to each other. Optimal line lengths, for example,
    are often expressed in terms of how many characters or words will fit within the
    measure, and this is a function of point size. You can calculate the appropriate
    point size for a given measure in different ways. Here are some of the more commonly
    proposed guidelines:<ul><li>the optimal line length is between one and a half
    and two times the length of the lowercase alphabet</li><li>the optimal line length
    is nine or ten words (figure an average of 5\xBD characters per word)</li><li>27
    characters is the minimum line length, 40 the optimum, and 70 the maximum</li></ul>A
    guide that I prefer compares the line length in picas with the type size in points.
    Because it uses simple math, you don\u2019t have to count individual words and
    characters. In this scheme, a measure (in picas) three times the size of the type
    (in points) is the absolute outer limit, and it is too long most of the time.
    Thus, 10-point type shouldn\u2019t be set over a measure exceeding 30 picas. The
    ideal ratio is about 2 : 1 or 2\xBD : 1, which translates to a measure of 20 to
    25 picas for 10-point type. When the ratio approaches 1:1 (10-point type over
    a 10-pica measure, for example) good type composition becomes almost impossible.

  body: I'd add that leading plays rather a large part, solid type (10/10) will be
    much harder to read on the same measure than type well leaded.
