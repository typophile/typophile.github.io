  body: "smile\r\nJust had a discussion with my girlfriend about this topic.\r\nIt
    came up because of the word modern in regards to fonts.\r\nwhat is a modern font?
    I think people just wanted\r\neverything faster and faster, so there was no time
    to draw\r\nnice dropcap letters, there was no time to do something to\r\nperfection...which
    evolved to a point where you\r\ncouldn't reduce letterforms anymore and it seems,\r\nnow
    we start saving on letters, simplify a whole\r\nlanguage...but where is this going?
    do we simplify a\r\nlanguage to a point where we're not using words any\r\nlonger
    and just grunt at each other?\r\n\r\nsmile\r\n\r\nby the way: as a none native
    english speaker txt language is a pain\r\nin the ass. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: LOL..let's not beat her over the head with it. Maybe she was in a rush to
    post before class? That said, your essay should have carefully refined point,
    rather than hitting such a big subject as "Does Typography matter?" which will
    probably take you 6 months to write.
