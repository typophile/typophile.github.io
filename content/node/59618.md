  was going to do the type in Illustrator and stroke a path with an art brush. Can
  anyone suggest any other strategies? And specific brushes?"

  body: There's a whole range of brushes you can download on the internet, but what
    I'd do is use details of the font you're using for the type (e.g. I, l, |, -,
    _, ... are all ideal for making strokes). If you use those as your basis the result
    will look much more coherent.

  body: I'm not making a logo at the moment. I just need to know a strategy for creating
    this radical retro style type because it's a style I want to get into.
