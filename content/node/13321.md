body: "Could anybody tell me what are the specific names given to parts of a character,
  if indeed they are named, e.g. the descender of a \"g\", the horizontal cross through
  an \"f\", etc.  \r\nAre there different types of curve, lean or point/apex and is
  the dot of an \"i\" just a dot?\r\n\"Serif\" is about all I know! \r\nThanks, Syd"

    up about the [[eye]], [[ear]], [[terminal]], [[ascender]], [[descender]], &c.\r\n\r\n...or
    you could if it were working. *pouting*"
