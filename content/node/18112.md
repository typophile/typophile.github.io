  body: HK, please email me directly. I'm in contact with a group of foundries who
    keep one another posted on things such as this. If you would rather not, watch
    for Thomas Phinney, he works as part of the type design group at Adobe.

  body: "This is indeed a troubling issue, when you mentioned this I went and did
    a quick search on popular bit-torrent sites (I do not use them at all FYI) and
    found Adobe Font Folio 10 available for download to all. This is not a good sign,
    however I wonder who downloads from these bit-torrent sites. Are they professional
    graphic designers or just random bit-torrent leechers looking for something to
    play with? Either way it's unacceptable.\r\n\r\nWhat can Adobe (and other Type
    foundries) do to eliminate this? or is there anything we as a type community help
    this issue?"

  body: "Thanks! Hmm,that\u2019s a comprehensive form.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I don't
    think it\u2019s effective against BitTorrent or other popular forms of internet
    piracy. I was wondering if there was really anything they (or we) could do to
    curb this.\r\n\r\nIf you're unsure what BitTorrent is, here is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittorrent\">wiki</a>.
