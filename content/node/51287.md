  body: "I would need to consult my Korean typeface specimen books, which are in my
    office, but I am still at home. Clearly, it is a heavy sans serif design on which
    a shadow effect has been applied. We licensed a similar design from Hanyang in
    the 1990s, and the font is HYKakHeadlineStd-Bold. Here is a sample, using the
    same characters as shown above:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hykakheadlinestd-bold_6372.jpg]\r\n\r\nDr.

  body: "I don't know if you need an exact match, but if you do, your sample isn't
    in HY Headline Bold (sample below, condensed to 90%), although it's certainly
    a similar style.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hangullll_5133.jpg]\r\n\r\nMost
    Korean foundries have their own versions of \"Headline (\uD5E4\uB4DC\uB77C\uC778)\"
    designs of this style, such as HY Headline, Rix Headline, etc. They may be offered
    in angled (<em>gak</em>, \uAC01) or round (<em>dunggeun</em>, \uB465\uADFC) versions,
    hence the HY Kak Headline, <em>kak</em> being an alternate romanization of \uAC01.\r\n\r\n\"Headline\"
    faces are also called <em>jemok</em> (\uC81C\uBAA9) faces, so you may also have
    to look through some <em>dunggeun jemok</em> (\uB465\uADFC\uC81C\uBAA9, round
    headline) faces offered by different foundries.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to
    find an exact match. It's not one of the usual suspects (Hanyang, Baekmuk, Sandoll,
    etc.) and I've exhausted the few specimens I have. Online samples are too small
    and most often don't include the glyphs \"\uD55C\uAE00!\". If you need an exact
    match, I can investigate further."
