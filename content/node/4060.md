    search?

  body: Yes. I have searched numerous font sites and searched for blackletter fonts
    via Google. <BR> <BR>This font is vaguely similar to Linotext, Old English or
    perhaps Cloister Black. My problem is that I need to find this EXACT typeface.  <BR>
    <BR>I am continuing to search the web.

  body: Kirk, I think you may have to deal with the real possibility that this is
    a custom lettering job. That G seems absolutely simplified from any blackletter
    G I can find. The &#39;a&#39; is also very different from most blackletter fonts.
    A lettering artist would have only had to make 5 letters to create the whole word,
    and a font would never have been needed. I even looked at Photo-Lettering types,
    which could have been the source if &#39;19??&#39; was earlier than about 1988
    when digital types started coming into wide use. My catalogs of film types probably
    don&#39;t show everything, and the other source, the Solotype Catalog, doesn&#39;t
    show a match either.  <BR> <BR>If it has to be exact, why not just use their existing
    art?

    he designs a lot of those.
