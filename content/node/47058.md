  body: I like Adelto set in Cocon at the top, but the bottom does not seem to match.

  body: "Hi there SUF!\r\n\r\nYeah it does not seem to run through correctly, as we
    will be selling high-end funriture, bespke products and building services, we
    want to look contemporary and modern (cocon) and also luxurious (the tagline)
    \ i might not have the tagline, but it just helps with the brand, lets people
    know what we are about, can you think of a font that would be better suited? All
    suggestions and ideas are welcomed!!\r\n\r\nThanks for your input,\r\n\r\nRichard\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adelto.co.uk"

  body: "I think it looks great, but I agree with SUF that the font for the strapline
    doesn't quite look the right font, being just a tad too 'sharp'.  If you can try
    some other serif fonts I'm sure you'll find one that works better.  I'm also wondering
    if the strapline could be a little closer to the main logo, but i'm sure you tried
    all these things before settling with the layout you currently have.  I was just
    thinking maybe a little more equilibrium between the tracking of the strapline
    letters & the space between the strapline & the logo.\r\n\r\nGlad you feel you
    can still come here for opinions.\r\n\r\nJH\r\n\r\n"

    suggest one to you as he might know a good complement for Cocon."

  body: Well  have to say glad you picked this one out of the original bunch :)  Looks
    great though, great color choice. Not a heavy black, but not a really light gray.
    Adds an element of sophistication. As for getting "nit picky" I think another
    font for the tag is in order as everyone else has said. I also want to see it
    a tad darker. Only a few shades, nothing too drastic. Or same shade and a slightly
    thicker font. I just think it sort of gets lost especially being a little far
    from the main part of the logo.
