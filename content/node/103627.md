  before, and I can't seem to locate this font.  I find things that are close, but
  the capital F is what throws the whole thing, as it's got the curve in the top portion,
  as well as the disconnected lower case letters like \"a\" and \"d\".  Thanks for
  the help!"

  body: Looks like a rounded version of Blippo, Pump, Hippo etc. But none of those
    seem to have a "round" version.
