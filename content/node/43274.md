  publications available for free download from [[http://www.pdf-mags.com/|Pdf Mags]]\r\nIt
  gives people the chance to publish a magazine or zine without the uphill struggle
  of paying for print,distribution and amusing advertisers! Lovely, having worked
  in magazine world for a while, it's nice not feel owned by the bloodsuckers! \r\n\r\nI
  have noticed though, that although many nice mags, virtually no font or typography
  magazines. Theres a 'select by category' bar in there and under fonts, there appears
  to be just one. \r\n\r\nI thought i'd give all you typonuts a heads up! as this
  section is crying out for some beautiful type pdf magazines. Maybe even a Typophile
  publication. \r\n\r\nanyhow. Enjoy if you haven't seen this site before.. \r\n\r\n "
