  body: "This looks like an embroidery font that does not seem to match any retail
    font.\r\nIt seems to have been based on 19th century fonts styles ranging from
    \"Antique\" [Egyptian] to Clarendon.\r\nThe serif treatment on _S_ seems to be
    the key to the source fonts.\r\nPerhaps the closest source might be Kinghorn 205
    Med  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kinghorn205MedAsHMNZS_4685.gif] http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/talbot/kinghorn-205/
    which has  strokes and serifs all of a roughly equal weight similar to the lettering
    in the Cap Tallie. There is also a condensed version. \r\nThe reverse contrast
    -- top and bottom thicker than sides -- shown in the top of _S_ in the Cap Tallie
    might be a quirk of that the digital instructions for that letter.\r\nAlso consider
    Antique Central Heavy  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AntiqueCentralHeavyAsHMNZS_5180.gif]
    \ http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aboutype/antique-central/\r\nif you want reverse
    contrast you could consider [img:sites/default/files/old-images/PTBarnumAsHMNZS_5815.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/p-t-barnum/ which suggests the _S_ but
    the vertical strokes are too thin.\r\nDon"

  body: "The best match would be a Clarendon with strokes and serifs all of a roughly
    equal weight, which would differ from an Antique or Egyptian in that some of the
    terminals, such as those in _E_ and _L_, are tapered.\r\nPart way there is Patrick
    Griffins Clarendon Text Bold\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ClarendonTextBoldAsHMNZS_4966.gif]
