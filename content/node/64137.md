  learn a bit.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picsahoy_by_brianskywalker_6135.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  title is a font called Manuscript Gotisch, which looks quite piratey. The text that
  says 'image hosting' is set in a more open, less condensed, less ornamented face,
  Fette Trump-Deutch, because the other is very wily at smaller sizes, the details
  of it.\r\n\r\nEverything else is Baskerville. \r\n\r\nI did the design, wrote copy,
  and coded the layout in css/html. Tools used_ Adobe Illustrator CS2, CotEditor,
  a bunch of web browsers."

    type-centric aesthetic has to do with image hosting. '

  body: "@Aluminum\r\nThanks. With a name like 'Picsahoy', the first thing hat really
    came to mind, other than Chipsahoy cookies, was something to do with pirates.
    Blackletter looks piratey in the right contexts. An icon like an anchor, or a
    Galleon, was going to be used, but that never came through.\r\n\r\nYou might thing
    that you need photos or something on an image hosting site, but I was told that
    really what users want is a quick login or an upload box right away.\r\n\r\nBri\xE4n"

  body: The aesthetic is really nice, but the type gets a bit hard to read. I first
    see "Picshop" or "Picsahop".

  body: "2nd what aluminum said.\r\n\r\nAs a personal portfolio, this would be great.
    But not for image hosting.\r\n\r\nImage hosting is all about providing a seamless,
    reliable service, digital service. You don't want customers doing a double-take
    and wondering if they accidentally clicked on the wrong site. And the \"analog\"
    background is a big no-no, imo (unless you are going for the lo-fi image hosting
    market).\r\n\r\nAnd I would say never use blackletter on a mainstream site, unless
    you are a beer company."
