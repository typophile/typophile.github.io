  inspired by some hand lettering I did for a logo. I know there's still a lot of
  tweaking to do, and I would love love love any feedback!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nCassie[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture44_3560.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture45_5918.gif]"

  body: PS one of the things I'm having an issue with is the g. The y is also a little
    wierd in that its descender is not as long as it should be. Would it make sense
    to have the g and y have one descender length and the p, q and j have another?

  body: "I think you have a really nice start. Just a few things I really noticed:\r\n\r\n-
    the e, k, o, v, w, x, z are the same thickness throughout the letter, and the
    other letters have some variations. They seem to be from a different typefaces,
    at least to me.\r\n\r\n- the w also seems a little wide and leaves a really bad
    space in the word \"anyway\" that I do not believe you could fix with kerning
    pairs.\r\n\r\n- maybe the t works better at smaller sizes but at the size you
    provided it seems to drop below the baseline too much.\r\n\r\n- the fl ligature
    looks odd where the ball in the f and the l collide. The purpose of ligatures
    is to really make the transition smooth and elegant."

  body: "The bottom of the y seems a little clunky.\r\n\r\nCan you show us how you
    see this being used? Intended use will have a great deal of impact on the direction
    you would want to take this. The clearer you are about this the better the face
    will be."

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nHere's the original logo (color) that I did,
    and then a version of what it would look like now that I've actually spent time
    on the letterforms (b & w). It would also be used as a display type on stationery
    and collateral. I'd really like it to be legible/readable at text sizes, although
    I know it won't be able to get too small since it is a little funky.\r\n\r\nMichael:
    I know, I really struggled with that fl ligature. But I looked at a lot of other
    fonts with ball terminals, and that seems to be how the fl is treated. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture46_5980.png]"

  body: "I'm not sure the angled terminals on bdhklmnpqru go with the bouncy feel
    of the rest - it's like a combination of X-Acto blades and bubbles - but the difference
    I suppose adds to the liveliness. I would experiment with the m, n, and r at least.\r\n\r\nIf
    y is giving you trouble: did you consider doing a y that is u-shaped with a curving
    descender instead of the diagonal form?\r\n\r\nI agree that the fl ligature isn't
    working - I would abandon the idea of a ball terminal on a line that's not actually
    terminal.\r\n\r\nI think all of your ligatures need to be spaced out more.\r\n\r\nI
    like this font - it's fun. It says to me: Las Vegas, The Price is Right, Sherwood
    Schwartz shows, 60s stewardesses, Acapulco honeymoons."

  body: "Below is an image from Gerrit Noordzij's \"the stroke\". The purpose of the
    image is to show how easy it is to break up a word and make it hard to read by
    making the space between letters stop relating to the counter-space or space inside
    letters. I suggest that you look at the white spaces and get them to start to
    balance. In general your interletter space is too small to be comfortable. As
    letters get physicaly ( optically really ) larger you can let them come together
    a bit more and you might need to add space at very small sizes. But in even in
    these cases this 'rule' still applies just to a different degree. You might have
    to make your counters smaller  ( they are very big) as well as adding space between
    letters. Doing this will make the massive gap between y+w less bad but you should
    also fix that - probably by making the angles of the diagonal steeper.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/whitespace_6611.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Sometimes, in words such as \"exotic\", there isn't enough flavor to carry
    the word. I wonder if this isn't one of those times where more is better. For
    instance, should the o have a tiny loop? Should the n have a tail? Should the
    b and d have curls? I guess why not a little more character on all the blank letters?\r\n\r\nThe
    it ligature isn't working for me. It looks almost like an ampersand when small.\r\nThe
    ri ligature isn't working for me either."
