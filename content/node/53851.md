  signs because there is a variety of New Orleans signage. Most signs, in my opinion,
  is a cross between Las Vegas and Jazz. I have noticed that New Orleans based businesses
  use a lot of serif typefaces. Our signs are more expressive and free compared to
  other cities. Other cities that has local businesses use more conservative typefaces.
  Being from New Orleans, I realize that many businesses use flashy, noticeable signs.
  Neon lights are even used for local businesses. I think that is why many businesses
  in New Orleans become so successful because when people pass by and see their signage,
  most people want to try their food just by observing the signage."
