  ... for those who don't know how it looks...\r\n\r\nI know that many of you here
  knows about fonts more than fonts designers itself, so I neeed little help from
  you.. \r\nIs there, anywhere, a font that is Metroflex clone, or Metroflex double,
  or anything that is as similar as it can to this type. \r\n\r\nMy problem is that
  Metroflex wasn't made in opet type format, and as I live in country with language
  full of speicial charachters (\u0161\u0111\u010D\u0107\u017E\u0160\u0110\u010C\u0106\u017D),
  that's why I need OT.\r\n\r\nAny sugestions are more than welcome\r\n\r\nTnx,\r\nMirko\r\nSerbia"

  body: "Hi Mirko,\r\n\r\nactually, there\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=metroflex+ot\">OpenType
    version of Metroflex</a>.\r\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t solve your problem: what
    you need is CE language support. You could try contacting <a href=\"http://www.garagefonts.com/foundryinfo.html\">the
    foundry</a> (or <a href=\"http://www.schmalfett.de/\"> the designer</a>). Chances
    are they can add the desired characters, or maybe grant permission to let a third-party
    typedesigner do the extension for you. Among others, <a href=\"http://davi.cz/\">David
    B\u0159ezina</a> and <a href=\"http://www.designiq.eu/\">Filip Bla\u017Eek</a>
    are specialists in the design of Central-European diacritics.\r\nF"
