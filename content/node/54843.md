  that I have made in honor of the letter C. I searched magazines for anything and
  everything that began with the letter C, and this is what I came up with.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nThis
  Collage depicts a Chick Chatting on her Cellphone as her Convertible Collides into
  a Covergirl Clutching her Champagne Colored Chance Chanel as the Contents of the
  Cranium of a Conair Carrying Cutie (including Cosmetics, Curve, Cats, and of course
  the  letter C) spills and Crashes onto the Car."
