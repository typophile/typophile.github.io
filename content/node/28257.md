  and biathlon statistics from 1938 to present (believe it or not). All tables. We
  tried both Smart Cells  (woodwing) and Table-/Cellstyles pro, but they were both
  no good.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know a good plugin for handling tables in Indesign?
  I've been working quite a lot in html, in really miss the simpliccuty from that
  \"world\".\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nAlex"

    who has a web design background. From my (print-based) perspective, designing
    tables with InDesign is far more simple than with HTML, even with only the built-in
    table functions.*\r\n\r\nCan you show us an example of what the tables should
    look like? Or what you need the plugin to do?\r\n\r\n* In fact, if you don't mind
    if I \"turn the tables\" on you for a bit - I'm looking for a visual tool that
    will help me build HTML tables!"

  body: "hi stephen,\r\nlast things first: in html, i do all tthe table styling via
    stylesheets. whenever i update my .css, i refresh the browser window, and see
    the changes instantly. \r\n\r\nthe tables we're working on are really complex,
    with loads of exceptions, warying widths, and quite a few russian gold medalists
    with too long surnames for our layout.\r\n\r\nwhat i miss in indesign, is the
    ability to assign classes or styles to tables, rows, cells etc. \r\n\r\ntablestyles
    pro is supposed to work like this, but it seems far to unstable for me. also,
    it doesn't provide all the attributes that css does (padding, margin, typographic
    options etc.).\r\n\r\nalex"

  body: "Padding, margin, typographic options etc are all available in InDesign's
    tables, without a plug-in. Nearly anything you can do with a regular text box,
    you can do with a table cell. \r\n\r\nAs for styles, that I don't think is available.
    You can adjust any cell, row, or column just by selecting it and changing options
    either in the table palette or dialog box. I assume you have done this, but wish
    to adjust the same column on multiple tables at once. I see your dilemma.\r\n\r\nSomething
    tells me we could teach each other quite a bit if we were only in the same office
    for a day. Now, for that ticket to Oslo..."
