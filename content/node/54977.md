  look at the word \"Elves\" you can see the distinction between the upper and lower
  case \"E\" quite clearly. Also, the text \"SAGA OF THE STORM\" at the top of the
  image appears to be actually typed with the Caps Lock on. I've never seen the font
  at a large size and this is about the best I can do in terms of an image. If it's
  any help, the image is from a 2001 screenshot.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Warlord
