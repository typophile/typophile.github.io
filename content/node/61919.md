    Japanese kanji names. Do you help translate the names and sections to English?

  body: "It's still not abundantly clear what you're asking. Are you asking someone
    to translate/transliterate this, or are you trying to find software that will
    recognize the characters to do it automatically?\r\n\r\nAnyway, here is my own
    stab at the titles on the left side: \r\n\r\n\u6B7B\u795E\u56F3\u9451 = The Title:
    \"Bleach\"\r\n\u6F14\u51FA = Director\r\n\u4F5C\u76E3 = Shortened form of \u4F5C\u753B\u76E3\u7763
    = Animation Director\r\n\u539F\u753B = Original Creator\r\n\u8272\u6307\u5B9A
    = Color\r\n\r\nAs to transliterating the names associated with these four titles,
    I can tell you that Japanese ones are a whole lot of fun, especially given names.\r\n\r\nI
    also looked for information about the 3rd Bleach movie, and the names don't match
    up to the titles. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach:_Fade_to_Black,_I_Call_Your_Name
    and http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/bleach/\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior Computer

  body: "Be VERY careful when translating Japanese names. \r\n\r\nOften, the Kanji
    are pronounced very differently from identical Kanji that appear in other Japanese
    words. Maybe sometimes there is even more than one possible pronounciation. There
    are special dictionaries for Japanese names, and if it's important to get it right,
    I'd recommend to consult one of these dictionaries. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand,
    if it's a film, maybe you can find the romanizised names somewhere on the internet,
    then you don't need to translate them.  "

  body: "There is a massive difference between 1) asking someone, or a group, to translate
    and/or transliterate text from one language to another as a one-time or one-off
    request, and 2) doing what you're doing, which clearly amounts to significant
    work or effort, and is thus extraordinarily unreasonable and incredibly inappropriate.\r\n\r\nAs
    others have suggested more than once, you need to hire a genuine translator, or
    contact a translation agency. If I were Akira1975, I would ignore your requests.
    In fact, you should feel quite lucky for the extent that he has helped you thus
    far."
