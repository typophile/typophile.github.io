    but it looks only close to me and /c is completely off...\r\navant garde': [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/akzidenz-grotesk|Akzidenz-Grotesk]]
    ultra tightly tracked should do the job\r\n\r\nEDIT: after further inspection,
    may be I'm not so wrong with Futura, /c does not look so off. I was probably abused
    by sample quality and tight tracking. BTW, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sh|Scangraphic
    SH]] version of Futura might the lightest Futura you could find (or at leat I'm
    aware of)."
