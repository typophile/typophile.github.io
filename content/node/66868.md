body: "<strong>May it be, that there is the following bug in Quark XPress 8 (Windows)?:</strong>\r\n\r\nIf
  an OT feature contains the language statement \"language DEU;\", Quark XPress ignores
  all the following features. The feature itself (the one, that contains the language
  statement \"language DEU;\") works.\r\n\r\nIn this case the font was built with
  FontLab and did contain one languagesystem statement only, namely \"languagesystem
  latn dflt;\". (More to the point, that\u2019s the default statement of FontLab,
  isn\u2019t it?)\r\n\r\n<strong>And I think, there is another bug:</strong>\r\n\r\nIf
  a feature file contains the statement \"languagesystem DFLT dflt;\" only (font built
  with MakeOTF [AFDKO]), but not the statement \"languagesystem latn dflt;\", none
  of the features work, at least not in German.\r\n\r\n<strong>Oh, maybe another bug:</strong>\r\n\r\nQuark
  XPress seems to dislike substituting spaces in features. Example: While \"sub space
  x space by x;\" would not work, \"sub slash x slash by x;\" works as intended.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone verify one or more of these bugs?"
