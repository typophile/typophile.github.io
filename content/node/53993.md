body: "For some reason, photoshop is acting like I have EVERY FONT OPEN *(ie; only
  able to show fonts starting with letters \"A\" through \"F\") - though in Fontbook,
  I clearly have only the essential fonts turned on, with everything else turned off.
  \  My system fonts folder is as it should be and neither Illustrator nor InDesign
  are acting like this... \r\n\r\nWhat could be making Photoshop think that all fonts
  are open when they are not?   \r\n\r\nNOTE:  I know Fontbook isn't the best, but
  I'm not a big fan of Linotype FontExplorer...  \r\n\r\nAnyone ?"

  body: "Hi\r\nI had the exact same problem. It was because I had too many fonts for
    Photoshop and mainly Fontbook to manage properly. Once I had installed Suitcase
    everything worked in the best perfect order. You most likely have far too many
    fonts...?"

    for previewing fonts.  I'm surprised that Mac can't do a better job of creating
    a native application with the power of Suitcase. "

  body: "I know, Fontbook is crap.  but still...\r\n\r\nThe last time this happened
    I checked fontbook and, but some mystery, every font was indeed turned on.   During
    that instance, both Illustator & Photoshop had the same issue.  Not this time.
    \ Fontbook has only 50 fonts turned on, and Illustrator works just fine...\r\n\r\nI'm
    stumped. \r\n\r\nM@"

  body: "Fontbook sucks, it really does, but most problems can be solved by cleaning
    it up once in while. I'm using fontexplorer and i'm pretty happy with that, especially
    after all the problems i hadin de past  with suitcase. but i still have to clean
    it up once in while.\r\n\r\n(ps. i try to avoid using type in photoshop as much
    as possible, it just doesn't work as well as in for instance illustrator.)"
