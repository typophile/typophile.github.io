  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hi guys,
I'm a student of design at Politecnico di Milano.
I will make a video aboutGeorgia  font, but I don't have enough info about it.
I'm searching the web, but find more info about Carter and poor articles about Georgia, asking to teachers but they told me always the same short infos:

"It's one of the best serif screen type,designed by Mr. Matthew Carter for MS after long studies and experiments about screen res."


Can you help me with info and good links?

thanks,

Andrea</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Great topic! Maybe one day you can make it into
something as famous as the Helvetica movie!  :-)

Here's one thing - an interesting old interview:
http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm

In terms of history, like Claus says it's related to Miller,
and they're both what's called "Scotch" type - you might
like to read up on that in chapter 21 of A Lawson's classic
"Anatomy of a Typeface".

And if you have the time/patience to sift through a great deal of
writing you might find some interesting things here on Typophile,
but use Google's search, like this: "site:typophile.com georgia"

Lastly, a big part of Georgia's essence is of course related to its
on-screen quality, so you might do some research into bitmap
fonts, hinting, etc. not least by searching Typophile, but also
via Microsoft's superb type section:

thanks so much for your speedy answers!:)
Clauses thanks for the video! I never see it!
Hrant, thanks for the links and the tips about search! The interview was my most interesting source:)

If you have more tips you're welcomed!

thanks again!

p.s.= A friend of mine has told me about a book called "A matter of type" but I'm unable to find it! I think to have the wrong title..anybody knows the right one?

		<div class="commentbody">Caro Andrea, un consiglio se mi permetti, specialmente se è la priva volta che scrivi su questo forum, non presentarti con "hi guys" e in minuscolo. Poi controlla gli spazi (mi riferisco a "aboutGeorgia", "type,designed", "title..anybody"). Questo è importante anche per i tuoi studi di design.

Alessandro, sì hai pienamente ragione è la prima volta che scrivo e mi scuso per i refusi, gli errori e per il modo in cui mi sono presentato. Cercherò di fare più attenzione d'ora in avanti. Grazie anche per il link, ma anche la pagina sul Georgia della Microsoft l'avevo già letta. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">In regard to Georgia/Miller.

I think Georgia was commissioned by Microsoft in TrueType format in the early-1990s. I know Miller (which is somewhat identical, in regard to basic letterforms) was not available then. I think in 1995 or 1996, I had asked Matthew if he had a PS1 Mac/PC convertible roman with a companion Greek (there was nothing available at the time) and he said he had the beta Miller and Wilson Greek but they were not sized to each other and Miller did not have an italic at that point. What I needed was a full roman and italic (with all Latin forms and characters that had been used by the Aldines—including arcane incunabular) and a Greek. Carter bit the bullet and provided the needed typeface/s as Manutius, which was later commercially available as Miller and Wilson Greek (without all the alternate characters). Manutius was decommissioned with the completion of the project in 2000/01. As I recall Carter ran most of it through Font Bureau.

I think Manutius is referenced in Typographically Speaking or some other recent issue devoted to Matthew but I have not otherwise seen mention of it.

With Matthew's permission though, I wrote an article on it for Printing History (Journal of the American Printing History Association). Includes some typographic specimen showings of the book project, The Aldine Press.

		<div class="commentbody">You might want to look into this... 

http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=5819

Some chaps at a gallery/studio in Seattle, wanted to do some kind of font exhibit during TypeCon and I suggested that Matthew's Microsoft work might make for a good subject. When I contacted Matthew he noted that there's very little source material, drawings etc., for these fonts and that there’s a lot of misinformation about them floating around out there. He thought telling the story of these fonts might set the record straight, so a possible approach they’re looking at is interviews with the people involved, along with visuals of the fonts themselves. We’re also keeping John Berry in the loop, re. a possible book or article related to this.
