  body: The lined font may be Prisma by Rudolph Koch. <a href="http://typophile.com/node/15473">James
    Goggin</a> and [[Lineto]] will release Prisma in various styles later this year.
    In the meantime, if you don't mind going '70s, there's Rian Hughes' <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=DET0000260">Dazzle</a>  and
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/pump_triline/">Pump
    Triline</a>.

  body: The first image uses <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/romic-sh/"
    target="_blank">Romic</a>. Predigitally, there were italics for several weights.
    Digitally, it seems that only the Light weight has an italic.
