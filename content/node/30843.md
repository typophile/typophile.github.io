  similar to as shown on the image? I like this font so much, old one. Thanks in advance

    contain all the suspects, of which there are many.\r\n\r\nI think the answer is
    one of the Monotype Modern Extendeds but don't quote me.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/30542"

  body: "This looks a lot like a specimen of what is now <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=202580&grab_id=0&page_id=26136&query=modern&SCOPE=Fonts\">Monotype
    Modern Wide</a> (it was very likely originally sold as Modern No. 8 or somesuch,
    but you'd probably need to go to a contemporary specimen book to get the exact
    citation).\r\n\r\nHowever, the digital version is a large optical size, and the
    scan you posted is a smaller one. You won't get the effect.\r\n\r\nFortunately,
    the Computer Modern faces Michel mentions are reasonably similar, and gloriously
    <em>do</em> come in a complete family of optical sizes. In fact, they deserve
    credit for being one of the first optically scaled families in digital form."
