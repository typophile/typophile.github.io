    (at least in Polish edition) as a text typeface, among Chaparral, Charter, Gentium,
    Minion, Scala and Garamond.\r\n\r\nIn \"Twelve Angry Men\", you can see something
    very similar to Calibri, but warmer. I don't know if it exists as a font, and
    if so - can it be used in book setting. Just by the way."

  body: Calibri for a book sounds weird. Are you looking for another condensed roundy
    humanist sans-serif or something more texty?

  body: "Just to wrap it up, I just had a private discussion with Mr. Brown.\r\n\r\n>What
    is it about Calibri you don't like?\r\n\r\nThe problem with Calibri is that text
    looks \"fat\" in offset print, especially at typical text sizes (9\u201311 pt).
    There is nothing wrong with the design but it's just not designed for print. So
    this\r\n\r\n>You Can use Georgia or Arial Black..\r\n\r\nwouldn't work either.\r\n\r\nMr.
    Brown offered his client some samples in TheSans (\"another condensed roundy humanist
    sans-serif\"), Myriad Pro, and one other sans serif he couldn't recall.\r\nThe
    client went with Myriad, so my guess would be the other fonts just showed 'too
    much personality' :D"
