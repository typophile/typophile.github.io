  bought the font \"Arno Pro\" from Adobe (Designer is Robert Slimbach). And I think,
  that the german quotes are wrong (see the attachment). What do you think?\r\n\r\nI
  wrote to Adobe Support, an they said, they can see only a little discrepance and
  they think everything is fine. I wrote back, that I don\xB4t think this is right
  - I\xB4m waiting for the answer since almost 2 months! I didn\xB4t find the \"type
  department\" by Adobe, so I couldn\xB4t ask them. \r\n\r\nThanks for support.\r\nGreetings\r\nFlorian"

    with Double Quotes in Arno Pro</a>.\r\nMiguel Sousa from Adobe chimed in, so the
    Type Department is aware of this bug for 15 months now. I don\u2019t know if there
    is an update available yet.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s really a pity, since it renders Arno
    almost useless for German typesetting: The \xBBguillemets\xAB are too extravagant
    (or \u2018historically authentic\u2019), and the \u201EAnf\xFChrungszeichen\u201C
    don\u2019t harmonise.\r\n\r\nSee also this rant on <em>spatium</em>, a German

    a f**k up! Fifteen months? What on earth are they waiting for? It's an embarrassment.
    If one were to use an \"English\"/\"American\" abf\xFChrungszeichen (close-quote)
    and baseline-shift it to fall to the bottom of the line, I suppose this could
    work as a temporary fix. But hardly a solution for a face that someone licensed...!"

    \r\n\r\nYes, it is really too bad. I bought the font 3 months ago - so, Adobe
    didn\xB4t fixed it in 12 months! Is it so difficult? I don\xB4t belive it! It\xB4s
    so a good font (in my opinion) - and it is well paid. \r\n\r\nI use the \"guillemets\"

    certainly not the answer that the Type department would give you, since we're
    aware of the bug and have fixed it already in version 1.012 (dated 8 December
    2008) as you can read on the [[http://store1.adobe.com/type/browser/html/readmes/ArnoProReadMe.html|font's
    Release Notes]].\r\n\r\nSince you licensed the fonts 3 months ago, I don't understand
    why you got an old version, but I'll try to find out. Meanwhile, I'll contact
    you directly to resolve your problem. Sorry again for the inconvenience."

  body: There's no easy mechanism for getting font updates. I wished the Adobe Updater
    took care of fonts as well, but it doesn't. And the Customer Support seems to
    not be that helpful when it comes to fonts. So, for lack of a better solution,
    please [[http://typophile.com/user/1844/contact|contact me via Typophile]].

    to research the problem and contact Adobe. But nothing happened, and they did
    not answer to any further enquires about the progress. \r\nThis is a pity, as
    the support for updating already purchased fonts is usually hard to evaluate with
    most vendors/foundries, and this example here just does not shed a good light
    on neither the general Adobe Support, nor Myfonts.com\r\n"

  body: "Oh, I don\u2019t actually own the font, but I would expect that a big vendor
    would care a bit more to offer an up-to-date version of a major font from a major
    foundry. Apparently not so, as they don't reply to any further inquiry (after
    they promised to look into it) and did not update the font either for a year now.
    \r\n\r\nAs for modification, this is only possible for the pros here in this forum,
    I wouldn't know how. Anyhow, my complain was that vendors could be deal the \u201Cupdating\u201D
    issue with more responsibility. \r\n\r\nHow do we know which version of a font
    we would by at which vendor?"

  body: "@ Peter\r\n\r\nAlthough the bug was fixed after ten months, the reason might
    be, that the bug lately was reported. And if somebody does not reply, this does
    not necessarily mean, that you are ignored. In this case I simply would ask a
    second time. I never had such a request to Adobe, but somehow I doubt, that they
    intentionally ignore their customers. At least this does not coincide with my
    notion of Adobe. (But I admit, that I am an Adobe junkie, since they have got
    me hooked on Photoshop 5.) And in contradiction to most if not all other foundries,
    Adobe publishes release notes of their fonts, which is commendable. Additionally
    there are a few people active on this forum, that work for Adobe and that probably
    recognize bug reports, if they are posted here.\r\n\r\nBut generally I agree with
    you with regard to update information: Licensees should be informed per mail,
    if a font is updated.\r\n\r\nEdited: I just see, that someone wrote, that the
    bug was reported 15 months before the fix. This would be definetely too long,
    especially because it was a heavy bug in my opinion."
