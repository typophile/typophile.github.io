  I can't find this information on dstype.com. Thinking about using it as the supporting
  typeface for all communications on an ID project I'm doing. I used Mercury for the
  logo, but the client can't afford to shell out $1,200+ for a typeface (it's for
  my church, tight budget). They will need to use it in-house, so they'll need to
  buy everything that we specify.\r\n\r\nI like Glosa because it reminds me a bit
  of both Scotch Romans and Dutch Fleischmanns. It feels quite appropriate for my
  (Presbyterian) church. Anyone know the backstory? I see Dino's icon lurking down
  at the bottom...perhaps he would be so kind as to elucidate for me :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMatt"

  body: "Matt,\r\n\r\nWith Glosa I intended to design something with no exact historical
    reference, I wanted a typeface that seemed to be traveling through the years from
    the types cutted by Fleischmann to a more contemporary approach. Obviously it's
    possible to find some references in the details like the perfect ball terminals
    and sharped serifs. Above all, I wanted the typeface to be extremely readable
    and rigid, yet modern and fresh.\r\n\r\nDino"

  body: "Matt,\r\n\r\nWhere are you getting $1200.00 as a price for Mercury? There
    are many, many choices of bundles to choose from. Look at the [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100017&cpuCount=1&variantTypeID=2|product
    page]] for Mercury with one workstation. Do you need to license the fonts for
    several workstations? Do you require every display and every text cut of the design,
    in all 4 grades? I'm mystified when people express interest in a typeface and
    then reject it because of price without investigating all the options. There are
    very few type families out there with a $1200.00 pricetag. Most typefaces are
    available in single weights or as basic families with 4 styles. "
