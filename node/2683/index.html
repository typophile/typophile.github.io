		<div class="commentbody">James, I personally don't think that's completely true. A lot depends upon HOW you look at it and what you EXPECT to see. If you see it upsidedown (think about a brochure laying on a table), you'll be surprised about how it will look then. Then it might not 'look good' anymore. Invert a character and you'll have the same effect. A lot of mistakes you will not see in small sizes. But use it big and you can be shocked. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You expect to see a perfect font, so automatically I think the brain 'corrects' the mistakes. It's the same with grammar mistakes. Some you don't see because your brain correctes them, but they are there.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's in the nature of fonts that there are a lot of ways on how to apply them. If a font contains some very small curve-mistakes that would mean that you limit the user in their creative application of it, because they could not use it bigger. That a font might have been optimized for small sizes does not mean that you can't use it big, or inverted, or vertical, or only the counterpunches, etc. I for myself do that very often in my work.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So for specific applications I agree with Dukes statement, but it seem to me to be only half of the truth. In this statement I miss the 'but&hellip;'. ;-) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">How you look at something and what you expect to see are all problems and experiences that make up the design process. My paraphrasing Duke here was in response to the original thrust of the thread that reversing your glyph would some how show you the countershape in a more critical environment. Personally I dont think any one enviroment is better than the other to evaluate a glyph shape, except for the environment that the type is designed to function in. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think a common mistake is evaluating a glyph at some monsterous size when the type face is suppose to function at 10-48 point.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not sure what the 'in reverse' test would tell you about a design intended for typical black on white use, other than that it probably isn't optimal for white on black. Luc(as) de Groot and Erik Spiekermann have both developed fonts that are specifically intended for white on black or backlit signage, and these designs are optimised for this purpose. In particular, if you have two signs side-by-side, one black on white and one white on black (or similar high contrast colours), you need to make the letters in the white on black slightly heavier and sturdier in order for them to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->look<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the same weight as the black on white.</div>
