  do you think of deviation kerning?  And is the 18x8 font readable?  I'm aware that
  it's a mish-mash; that's because I tried to differentiate the characters (in code,
  legibility can be more important than readability).  Does the 'e' fit?"

  body: "This is a cool idea!  However, I'm not completely sure I understand how it
    works.  I compiled the code, and ran termk, but I don't quite understand how the
    spacing is adjusted.  Does this work as a combination of kerning and ligatures?
    \ For ligatures (assuming ligatures are only made up of 2 characters), how do
    you decide whether to combine on the left or the right side of a character?\r\n\r\nSomewhere
    you mention that the calculation of spacing is done using dynamic programming
    and runs in O(n) time.  Could you explain it more explicitly?\r\n\r\nOne thing
    that I noticed using termk on the command line and in editors is that changing
    one character can have an effect very far away---for instance, when typing \"hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhi\",
    when the 'i' is typed, all of the 'h's shift right one pixel.  For editors, it
    might be worth considering how to force changes to be local to minimize visual
    disturbance. I presume this is why many WYSIWYG editors use ragged right, instead
    of full justification.  ;)\r\n\r\nBest wishes, Stephen\r\n"

  body: "sim: the typeface for the samples (except for the 18x8 one) is the xterm
    'Default' font, with some modifications (the ligatures, for instance, I drew from
    scratch).\r\n\r\nsgh: The basic procedure is the kerning; the ligatures are done
    afterwards as contextual glyph substitutions conditional upon spacing.  For instance,
    one of the rules in the 'ligatures' file is \"f-i** fi\", meaning \"an 'i' preceded
    by an 'f' kerned close, followed by anything, is replaced by the glyph from 'li_fi.pbm'\".
    \ Some of the ligatures are three-character, and the ligatures file consists of
    a series of rules whose order in the file determines precedence.  For instance,
    higher up the file is the rule \"f-f-i ffi\", which uses a different glyph for
    the middle 'f' of 'ffi' to that which would be used for the 'f' of 'fi' otherwise.
    \ When making the ligatures, I have been careful to ensure that any two compatible
    ligatures have a combined three-character ligature (not always the same as the
    ligatures that make it up), such as fth.  There is one exception, Fth, because
    the 't' of Ft is smaller than normal; in Fth only the th is ligated.  I should
    add that technically many of the so-called 'ligatures' are really only glyph substitutions,
    because the characters that comprise them are not joined together.\r\n\r\nThe
    algorithm to calculate the spacing makes use of the fact that the only thing that
    'matters' to a character spacing-wise is the position of the character before
    it.  So, it works along from left to right, at each point holding a table of the
    best score for each of the three positions of the last character (-1, 0, and +1
    px).  Then, for each of the three possible positions of the next character, it
    works out the new score (so that's 9 combinations, and for each it just adds one
    kerning-pair-score to one score from the table), and finds which score is best
    for each next-character-position, and those new best scores go in the table.  All
    of this takes constant time per character, so traversing the whole string should
    take O(n) time.\r\n\r\nWhen it gets to the end, it just has to pick whichever
    of the three scores is best, and work backwards along the string reconstructing
    the deviation of each character.  The current implementation does this by attaching
    the deviation values for the whole string to each of the three table entries,
    which means those values have to be copied for the table updates - which means
    the current implementation is actually O(n^2) - but it should be possible to store
    a kind of 'trellis' that can be traced backwards in O(n) time.  I just haven't
    got around to putting in the effort since it's already fast enough for 80 columns.\r\n\r\nThe
    action-at-a-distance effect is difficult to get rid of - or rather, forcing changes
    to be local would tend to give very poor kerning.  For instance, when you start
    typing your hhhh... it doesn't know whether you're going to follow that with iiii...
    or mmmm..., so it has no idea whether to give you plenty of space (by pushing
    all the h left) or plenty of anti-space (by pushing them right).  So, you find
    you've typically only got about half as much 'flexibility' to work with.  Certainly,
    it could be done, but I find that one rapidly gets used to bits of the display
    'wobbling' as you type - it's not as distracting as you'd think.  (Playing NetHack
    with it, on the other hand... now /that's/ impossible)"

  body: "ec429:  Thanks for the explanation!  I think I understand now.\r\n\r\nI wonder
    if a similar effect can be achieved by using (lots of) ligatures (or contextual
    substitutions) in a monospaced font.  Then it could be used by standard terminals
    and editors.  The downside of this approach is that it doesn't have the global
    optimization that you currently are doing with deviation kerning.\r\n\r\n<cite>(Playing
    NetHack with it, on the other hand... now /that's/ impossible)</cite>\r\n\r\n:-)"

  body: "sgh: My guess is, without the global optimisation you'd really struggle to
    get anything good, because most of what you want to do is narrowing: most monospace
    fonts are designed around the em, with anything narrower being stretched (hence
    the huge serifs on i and l).  Consequently, if you can't stretch other spaces
    out, you're going to be unable to have a decent kerning of things like i, l, f;
    they'll simply end up with too much space around them.\r\n\r\nAs for use in standard
    terminals and editors, the current method could be implemented in existing font
    rendering engines (by people who understand how those engines work), though anything
    that only re-renders part of the line when things change will encounter problems.\r\nIf
    you wanted monokerning in a GUI text editor, you'd probably have to modify the
    editor to render whole lines at once, in which case you may as well just make
    it use monokern directly like termk does.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you know how to code,
    I suggest you try experimenting with ways to force locality and see whether it
    works; personally, I don't think locality matters that much, since when I'm editing
    text (or code) I have a lot of regressive eye movement anyway (because I'm constantly
    re-evaluating what I'm typing).\r\n\r\nI suppose it might help if there were some
    way to smoothly move or fade the text to the new position when it moves, but that
    would be rather CPU-intensive (and might cause problems with small fonts which
    would just blur into a grey mush)."
