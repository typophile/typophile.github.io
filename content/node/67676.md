body: "I need some help! I'm trying to find a good font treatment for the \"#1\" in
  the logo. This isn't a stand alone identity, it is a companion piece if that makes
  sense. So far I've found Olicana http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-g-type/olicana/smooth-regular/\r\n\r\nI
  like it, but it doesn't blow me away.  I'd like to find something comparative to
  this script font but any and all suggestions would be awesome. The file attachment
  looks a little blurry b/c I did a screen capture of the olicana font before I decide
  to purchase (if I do.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: If it's just a one-off thing, just create your own using a brush in whatever
    preferred vector artwork program. Then you can really make it unique and interesting
    (as well as tailor it as needed for specific uses).
