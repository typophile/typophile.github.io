  body: "[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/life|Life]] could do the job but it's far
    from matching with main difference on /2 spine and /1 top bar. It also reminds
    me a bit of [[http://e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/t/trooper-roman.html|Trooper
    Roman]] (digitally available reinterpretations as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtrooper-foundry/trooper-roman|Trooper
    Roman]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/toledo|Toledo TS]], [[http://www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/Troover.htm|Troover
    PT]] and Talon Bold FBK).\r\nGot some better samples [[http://www.ebay.com/itm/Skys-Decals-1-72-ISRAELI-AIR-FORCE-F-16-TAIL-MARKINGS-/381206108367|here]]
    and posting a reworked sample, that may help other identifier. Note this type
    is available as plain and stencil (with main difference on /7 spine).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
