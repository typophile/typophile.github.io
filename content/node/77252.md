  I'm working on. Our youth  ministries are named \"Upsidedown youth ministries\"
  and I'm creating a logo for our youth services which are called \"invert.\" I want
  the logo to be a vertical ambigram that can be read upsidedown. \r\n\r\nI've got
  the design that I've spent a bit of time in the problem is that the letters don't
  seem to all give the same feeling so I'm needing some suggestions. Tear it to pieces
  please, but remember, it has to be able to be read upsidedown exactly the same.\r\n\r\nThanks
  much!\r\nR"

    these John Connolly book jackets.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gates_3693.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/nocturnes_4553.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
    not really a big fan of ambigrams unless they manage to avoid that typical goth/metal
    look that the distortion of letter forms tends to push them into. I think this
    would be lot better if you tried a much cleaner, geometric, monoline look. If
    you just want to adjust your current design I would remove the arrows and shorten
    the left stem of N which when mirrored on the R will help that to read better.
    At the moment it looks more like \"Invent\". "

  body: "Good point. I thought I had gotten away from the look once I changed from
    a previous stroke. In my study of ambigrams, I did prefer the cleaner look instead
    of goth (or else I could have been done in a few minutes with http://www.flipscript.com/ambigram-maker.aspx)
    but I was fighting with the make-up of the word.\r\n\r\n\r\nI adjusted the \"invert.\"
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Final-Invert-Logo_6066.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nI probably
    won't release the design until I get it like I want (which may be doing a complete
    redesign). Excuse my ignorance, but what do you mean by monoline?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_3510.gif]

  body: "Clever idea, but I'm not sure I'd know it said \"invert\" unless someone
    told me.\r\n\r\nSome other approaches might be for the logo to contain the word
    twice -- once regular and once as a mirror image upside down -- or maybe have
    just some letters be inverted.  For example...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/invert_3819.jpg]"

    a decent logo in the form of an ambigram because a) its never that legible and
    b) it often comes out looking like a death metal band logo.\r\n\r\nHeres my effort

  body: "I'm starting to see INHERIT in the newer versions. I think you should forget
    the ambigram and do something bold and clearly readable. INVERT in a bold sans
    with perhaps the N or R reversed. There might be some inspiration in this thread
    [[http://typophile.com/node/77215]]. Establish the visual identity this way and
    keep your ambigrams on the back burner to use as a one-off for an appropriate
    situation. \r\n"

  body: "One of my favourite ads to feature an ambigram was from brake line manufacturers
    Hel Performance. Most ads in bike mags feature either plastic 'crotch-rockets'
    or scantily-clad women. This one broke the mould and credited us with intelligence
    and typographical sophistication in one! The advertisement featured a beautifully
    crafted ambigram that reads DEVIL and ANGEL depending on which way up the page
    is held. The ad requires the user to actually turn the mag upside down to read
    the second half of the copy. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to post images but you can
