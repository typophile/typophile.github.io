  body: I am not a font designer. Theory looks good to me, too. In "Morning News"
    the space between the r and n looks small. It may look more like "Moming News"
    at text size. (Unless it was hand kerned for this graphic.)

    set with -2 in Sketch, and yes, it appears close, but it would be not as tight
    in a regular setting for body text."

  body: To my eye the /N/ seems too wide, and I wish its upper left corner related
    more clearly to /M/'s. Top terminals of /C/ and /G/ and both of /S/ look like
    they could stand more weight. Dollar sign is too dark. Was it intentional to have
    the upper bowl of /g/ not come up to the meanline? I would definitely align the
    bowl, rather than the ear, with the meanline.

  body: "Eliason, thanks for your comments. The typeface was optimized for the screen
    experience as text, not necessarily as titles. This means I made concessions and
    adjustments based on the impression in small sizes (a pixel height that gives
    an impression of what would be 10 to 14 points in print). I am considering a Display
    version, but if I would make one, it would be at the far end of the project.\r\n\r\nI
    thought the glyph N was roughly within roman Antiqua proportions, but it seems
    a tad too wide. The left shoulder has been deliberately designed differently than
    the M shoulders, for better rendering in small sizes. \r\n\r\nI went with a classic
    dollar sign instead of removing the inner lines, as some recent typeface designs
    have introduced. I\u2019ll revisit the dollar sign\u2019s look, especially in
    small sizes.\r\n\r\nI will revisit the lowercase g as well. I liked the slightly
    oval upper bowl and expanding it to the top will probably make it rounder. I\u2019ll
    see how that goes."

  body: "I think you really need more weight in the /r/ terminal, the /T/ has too
    short unilateral serifs at sides of the bar, serifs at /s/, /S/, /z/, /Z/, /c/,
    /C/, /G/ and right serifs at /E/, /F/ would need some xtra volume (lenght) too
    (as eliason wrote). I would recommend to make the right side of the bottom serif
    longer at /F/, /P/,/f/ and /r/ to add more visual stability to the letters. And
    the swash at /Q/ could be a little thicker, at least in comparison with the /f/
    terminal.\r\n\r\nJan"

  body: "MDrucker, Eben Sorkin\u2019s Merriweather has quite a different character
    and glyph proportions. There are also differences in details, like the closing
    stroke in shapes of a, d, p, b, etc. Look at how the incoming stroke meets the
    main stem in the lowercase a (bottom curve). The main characteristic of Theory
    Serif is probably the proportion of the glyphs, which tends to be wide, like with
    Sabon or Plantin.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if I can complete everything I had in mind,
    but my plans include a complete Serif family, a Sans Serif family as well as a
    Monospace family. The Serif would include Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic,
    but the Sans and Monospace families would additionally include Medium, Black and
    Light versions.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that I\u2019ll make Theory Serif Regular and
    Italic available under Google fonts, the bold versions can be licensed commercially.
    The same could be done with other families of the series."

  body: "Thanks, yaneczech, for your comments on the serifs. This point has been addressed
    numerous times since I started working on the font and I believe it is a characteristic,
    a style of this typeface that I don\u2019t want to homogenise too much. I don\u2019t
    intend to mimic Sabon and other Garamonds, I want to create a modern one, more
    minimalist and reducing serifs to a minimum. My origin with this design, the starting
    point, was the idea to have as little and minimal down- or up-pointing serifs
    as possible. The endings of E, F middle strokes were just enforced, they don\u2019t
    have serifs for this reason. I improved the down- and up-pointing serifs while
    working on the font, but because it is meant for screen reading, I don\u2019t
    want to accentuate them more.\r\n\r\nThe weight or volume of the top terminals
    of C, G and S have been slightly increased, following elian\u2019s advice, but
    the length of the serif has not been changed.\r\n\r\nAs for the lowercase r, did
    you look at it in the word \u2018Theory\u2019 or in the alphabet? The combination
    \u201Cry\u201D is a ligature in \u2018Theory\u2019.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Actually, my point was in unifying of serifs to keep more shape consistency,
    not to copy other styles. For me there are two different serif types. For instance
    your /i/ letter has relatively distinctive serifs, both top and bottom. On the
    other hand, the /s/ letter has rather triangular serifs \u2013 the connection
    is much more smooth, at least in smaller sizes it appears so, and they lack of
    spurs (unlike /z/, /T/, /E/...).\r\nThe /r/ letter is problematic because of its
    empty space underneath the terminal. To make it more balanced and legible I would
    suggest to enlarge the terminal a bit (and maybe moving the connection to stem
    slightly down). To that /r_y/ ligature: I'm not sure if it is necessary to create
    ligatures for these cases. I think it would be better to make one version, something
    like an average of the original /r/ and that one from the ligature.\r\nHave you
    tried the typeface with different rasterizers in small sizes already? (e.g. in
    Photoshop)\r\nOtherwise it looks nice, I like /N/ and /eszett/. :)\r\n\r\n"

    the black outline shows the new, refined shape of the lowercase r. Underneath
    you see the old shape (green) as well as the previous shape from an older version
    (I keep the last generation in the mask layer)."

  body: "Yes, Jan, I have tried it in different sizes. I appreciate your detailed
    explanations and recommendations. \r\n\r\nTo explain my conceptual (and visual)
    idea, I think of the serifs as two dimensions:  \u2013 |\r\n\r\nBecause this typeface
    was designed for screen first, I tried to shave off as much as possible from the
    vertical serifs in every instance, so this would affect the glyphs C, G, F, E,
    S, etc. in the uppercase range and c, s, etc. in the lowercase range. I then \u201Cworked
    my way up\u201D steadily expanding these serifs to the point where I felt \u201Cthis
    is just enough\u201D, trying to avoid to make them more distinct. This is of course
    tricky, because such details are important character influences. I think there
    are three serif types in Theory Serif, because the curved terminals are different
    than the ones in the lowercase i, but they are consistent throughout all curved
    terminals throughout the font.\r\n\r\nThere was also a weight problem: terminals
    with no distinctive vertical serif looked too light, the glyph was unbalanced.
    So adding weight (broadening the respective serifs) helped, and that is easier
    with curved letters, like the upper terminal of c, s, etc.\r\n\r\nAs for the lowercase
    r\u2014I had changed the flag to be a match with the flag in the lowercase f.
    This was on recommendation of Claus Eggers S\xF8rensen and Vernon Adams. I quite
    like it now and if I bend it down a little (to make it more distinctive, as you
    write) I need to change its unique shape. I found this an elegant solution that
    renders nicely on screen.\r\n\r\nGiven your advice, I have already visited the
    shapes of E, F, C, G, S, and let the serifs end on the same height level. I adjusted
    their weight as well for the reasons I just laid out."

    of the Regular cut of Theory Serif is close to completion. I am currently working
    on accents and glyphs in Greek and other languages.\r\n\r\nThe typeface has seen
    a complete redesign of most characters, particularly the serifs, with glyph width,
    stroke width, all numbers have been redesigned and more kerning pairs were added
    (including numbers, punctuation and space kerning).\r\n\r\nThere has been extensive
    testing with screen reading in various resolutions. I am using ReadKit (a Mac
    RSS reader app) to do most of the testing. This typeface was primarily designed
    for on-screen reading. You can always see the font in action on my website (http://core-ux.com).
    It\u2019s the body font throughout the site.\r\n\r\nThe next step will be the
    design of an Italic cut, which will probably take another couple of months, followed
    by bold versions. When all four are completed, I may add old style figures, but
    I first have to learn how to add them as an Open Type choice within the same font."
