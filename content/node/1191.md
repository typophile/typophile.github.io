  body: I&#39;m sure we had this one before, from the same poster, no less. But I
    can&#39;t remember whether there was actually a positive ID. It&#39;s very similar
    to Peignot, but it&#39;s definitely not that font. I imagine we decided that the
    thin font was Univers, but again, I&#39;m not sure. Yves or Stephen will remember
    better.

    we -quite regrettably- never succeeded in IDing  <BR>it. The condensed caps on

    movie posters and websites: <BR>Condensed credits on movie posters are usually
    set in <BR>Univers Ultra Condensed, and if you see some classic  <BR>looking all

    the &#34;only&#34; problem is that this one is Outline. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/special-alphabets-p04/#stylelist"

    discovered is that it is supposed  <BR>to be very similar to Peignot, just like
    Chesh said. <BR>It&#39;d be great if somebody could post a scan or any  <BR>other
    visual reference. <BR> <BR>Jean Fran

  body: I found a reference over at Bowfin to a foundry called Type Revivals. They
    had a face called Renoir that looked similar but the specimen was limited. Can&#39;t
    seem to find the foundry through Google. Atomic carries the foundry&#39;s output
    but no specimens to be found there and no Renoir.

    there are few like this in the Encyclopaedia of Typefaces but not the same, at
