  Any suggestions of fonts that are still simple enough to please the client but more
  unique, new or an example of one you have used. Thanks!

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.houseind.com\">Neutraface</a> has it's own unique flavor
    though because it evokes a certain architectural era (that happens to be hip right
    now). It's not a great general workhorse typeface. Don't get me wrong, if I wanted
    an art deco influenced face with contemporary appeal, Neutraface would be the
    one.\r\n\r\nIf what you're looking for is \"simple, block type\" I'd suggest <a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11353.0.0\">Zwo</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FB.116838.0.0\">Benton
    Sans</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11231.0.0\">Kievit</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=metroflex\">Metroflex</a>
    or pretty much anything from <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fonts&searchID=43&searchby=manufacturer\">LucasFonts</a>

  body: "joe-\r\nyou're absolutely right, those are much better examples of  \"simple,
    block type\".\r\n\r\ni was more responding to the 'tired of defaulting to gill
    sans bit'.  \r\ngill sans was my ol' standby for ages when i needed a classic,
    clean, sophisticated, handsome type.  There are thousands of sans that fit that
    description, but in the  bolder weights the distinct personality of gill sans
    (with it's perfect circles and consistent stroke thickness) was hard to match.
    \ I ran across neuraface a few years and found it to share a very similar geometric
    sensibility as gill sans... just interpreted a little differently.  \r\ni think
    of neutraface as being gill sans slightly more eccentric sister. \r\nit appeals
    to the same type of clients and projects that would call for gill sans, but the
    deco element adds a little vintage flair.\r\n\r\nhowever, you're right, it's not
    really what i would call a general workhorse typeface.  i just like using it specifically
    as a gill alternative."

    Chad, if at first glance it looks perfectly round, there have been optical adjustments

    nice pungent modernist aroma then Neutra is a good choice. And, you can tone it
    down if you license the entire opentype family by using the text versions with
    the alternates as opposed to the display versions. But, it isn't humanist it is
    definitely geometric.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you want something more humanist in a
    sans, and a little off the beaten humanist path, and still want that pungent aroma,
    check out [[Anisette Petite]] from <a href=\"http://www.typofonderie.com/\">Porchez

    italics -- not obliques which seem to be more in keeping with grots -- thanks

    quirks that make it annoying -- the lowercase t -- you really should look at Bliss
    from <a href=\"http://www.typography.net/\">Jeremy Tankard Typography</a>. And
    while you are there definitely check out Shaker too.\r\n\r\nI'm with Paul on Stainless.

    i would argue that \u2013 (except for a few kooky places like a and e) -- the
    stroke thicknesses are in fact quite consistent in gill sans\u2026\r\ncertainly
    more so than futura!\r\n\r\ncompare b, p, or q for example.\r\nfutura takes a
    geometric approach to the letters, preferring a neat, circular eye (eye? Is that
    right?) putting the negative space of the stroke a priority over the stroke itself.
    \ As a result, the stroke is steeply tapered at points.\r\ngill is more interested
    in keeping a steady, consistent stroke that, yes, tapers subtlety at joints but
    quickly restores the established width... in return it\u2019s curves are soft
    and flabby compared to futura, but the stroke retains it's established thickness
    much more than futura. \r\n\r\nas it's 'geometric sans serif' classification implies,
    futura certainly has the look going for it, but for some reason i tend to associate
    the humanist sans, particularly gill sans, with a more mathematical perfection.

  body: "Well, fontobsession, at least you weren't defaulting to Helvetica or Myriad!
    \r\n\r\nIf you were looking for something contemporary to Gill Sans and Futura
    (before they told you about Neutraface) but different, I would have said Goudy
    Sans...\r\n\r\nAvenir is a great suggestion - like a remix of the best of Futura
    and the neo-grotesque pattern, but how come nobody mentions the very workable
    Trade Gothic or Frutiger families in this discussion?\r\n\r\nMost clients can
    be persuaded to see the necessity of an update to Modula or Meta or Officina or
    even DIN (which I think is still dead fashionable despite having no italics...)\r\n\r\nOr
    how about Syntax, the world's most underrated humanist sans serif?\r\n\r\nIMHO,
    Gill Sans and Futura are the defining faces of the early twentieth century and
    represent two really contrary ideas about type design. They also came (by overuse)
    to represent the graphic vernacular of two entire nations; the mid-century joke
    was 'Q. How do you do British graphic design? A.Set it in Gill Sans and print
    it in racing green.'\r\n\r\nThey BOTH use optical adjustment to tweak the letterforms
    into appearing like they're monoline, but they follow radically different patterns
    of construction. Each idea has its strengths and weaknesses, which can be revealed
    by examinining the progression of heavier weights in the family - by the time
    you get to Gill Elefant or Futura Extra Bold, it should be apparent that neither
    of them is perfect.\r\n"
