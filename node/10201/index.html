  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Any advice on the best way to start a logo design business?  I'm not shooting for anything big (right now), just looking to target smaller local businesses&ndash;so that I can build a portfolio in order to work with larger ventures. <BR> <BR>Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Even with small companies/clients you will still need a portfolio to show what you can do. <BR>I would suggest doing work in your neighborhood. As folks may not be able to trust your skills (as you can not show them a lot of past work), they will know you as a neighbor with certain personal qualities, trustworthiness and perhaps even a recommendation from a mutual associates. At this stage pro-bono work doesn't hurt. Get that portfolio filled up. Also it is a good idea to document your work. <BR>Keep a journal and write down all the issues at hand with a job, the clients's budget, the time frames, challenges, intended audience. Keep sketches and all files related to the process. You can use this later to do &quot;case&quot; studies. These days a client may become just as confident in your skills by seeing why you created 10 jobs a certain way (wioth documentation) vs. the final result of 50 jobs without any reasons given. Also never underestimate the value of a nice portfolio case. Consider Pina Zangora, Lost Luggage, Shrapnel or Prat or a sweet case.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The best way to get started is create some eye catching logos that work for the specified client.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter how big the client is; what&rsquo;s important is how hard your work hits the nail on the head.  Then create a PDF portfolio of your logo work.  Circulate it online by targeting small companies that have amateurish logos&ndash;business types frequently don&rsquo;t know how to approach the issue.  A good hook is a temporary special offer; flat fee for logo, business card, letterhead and envelope.  Remember, though, your logo develops equity with time, so don&rsquo;t sell yourself short.  You will only get to bill for it once, so make sure you are fair to yourself.  More about this on my website under articles; &ldquo;Entrepreneur&rsquo;s First Choices . . .&rdquo; this article provides some selling tips you may be able to use.  Don&rsquo;t limit yourself by region; the world is your marketplace now.
Good luck.<br>
