    but I hate caps... And I hate my english too!

    Sans</a> seems almost to be an update to Benguiat Gothic. Is that what you had
    in mind? <BR> <BR>It will not show up at MyFonts.

  body: Thanks you! I was sleeping... <BR>In my mind it&#39;s more something like
    Handel Gothic [<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/handel-sans/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/handel-sans/</a>],
    rounded. Do you think that&#39;s existing?

  body: Not sure if you mean rounded strokes, or rounded letterforms. If you mean
    the letters, then how about <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/phatphonts/equaliser/"
    target="_blank">Equaliser</a> from Phat Phonts, or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cavalero-bt/"
    target="_blank">Cavalero</a>?
