body: "Hello,\r\nWe are Novo Typo / Typopixo from Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\r\nWe
  developed a code to make multi-color fonts (multicolor-pixels in png format in unicode)
  useable as webfonts. \r\n\r\nThe website for this new project is online for testing
  now. We are looking for high quality multi colorfonts to extend this collection.\r\nWho
  will be\_interested in selling your typefaces via this website?\r\nIt will increase
  your market, audience and sales for webfonts. We did some testing with typographers,
  designers, webdevelopers and programmers and the response is very enthusiastic and
  promising.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in a collaboration we can send you a link
  to the website, a personal login-code and detailed information about the technique,
  contracts and EULA, etc.\r\n\r\nTo convince you of our good intensions and the quality
  of our technique you can send us some multicolored png\u2019s with a transparant
  background. We can put them on the test-website so you will get an idea how it all
  works. Of course, if we don\u2019t come to an agreement we will trash all files.\r\nIf
  you are just curious how our technique is working, just send us an email. We will
  be happy to send you an inlog-code and some information about this new project.
  Please feel free to attend us on people who might be interested in this project.\r\n\r\nLooking
  forward to hear from you,\r\nbest regards,\r\n\r\nNovo Typo\r\nBeautiful typefaces
