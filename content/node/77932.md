  trying to build my final fonts using makeotf. I am using Fontlab\u2019s \u201CGenerate
  Font\u201D capability to create the PFA files I need to use with makeotf. When I
  do this a few of the composite glyphs are not being decomposed. Is this just another
  Fontlab bug or is there a way to fix this? Do I need to just generate my PFA fonts
  using VFB files that have no composite glyphs at all?"

    I didn't notice that before. But is that a problem? makeotf seems to decompose
    them all later, there are no composites in the resulting OTFs."

    you sure, that you don\u2019t mean autohint.exe? Autohint.exe accepts PS OTF.
    Your question on the <a href=\"http://forum.fontlab.com/hinting/importing-hints-from-compiled-fonts-to-fontlab-t7793.0.html;msg26267#msg26267\">FontLab
    forum</a> was related to the autohinting. And I have explained there, how you
    can use the autohint macro from the AFDKO with Flexhint generation."

    Then make your pfa. If you don't want to save that .vfb, don't.\r\n\r\nAso, there
    are several pfb_to_pfa utilities out there, so if you really want a .pfa, you
    could make one from the .pfb . . ."
