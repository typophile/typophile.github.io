  are dealing with the same font on both lines or not.\r\n\r\nEurostyle Next seems
  close, but does not match it exactly.  Microgramma is probably closer, but the bar
  and tail of the lower-case t line up differently.\r\n\r\nAny help with font ID here
  would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nhttp://i1179.photobucket.com/albums/x388/S_Jeff/logotextIDmed.png\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5259.text.ID.med.png]"
