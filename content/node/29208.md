    Add Caslon, Gill sans, ff Din and maybe plantin?"

  body: "Hi Thomas, it's an interesting question.\r\n\r\nLike Nick, having taught
    the local equivalent of Type 101 for some time now, I realise that my interests
    in teaching type history are at odds with a student requirement for the practicalities
    at beginner level. Although I recommend Bringhurst, Spiekermann <em>et al</em>
    on reading lists, most of what these authors have to say goes straight over the
    students' heads, so I must reaffirm what Nick and Paul say on this.\r\n\r\nA far
    better text at this level, IMHO, is Colin Banks and John Miles <a/href=\"http://www.linotype.com/2305/pleasuresofdesign.html?PHPSESSID=cdfbc6c620ce6c3729a847e0d7b8ecf0\">
    Pleasures of Design</a> which has been revised and is on the Linotype site in
    their Font Lounge area. \r\n\r\nAlthough they list 8 categories of type style;\r\n\u2013
    Old Face\r\n\u2013 Transitional\r\n\u2013 Modern, or Didone\r\n\u2013 Slab serif\r\n\u2013
    Sans serif\r\n\u2013 Decorative and Display\r\n\u2013 Script and Brush\r\n\u2013
    Blackletter\r\nwhich basically follow the Vox-based/conservative lists offered
    by the early respondents to your post, they don't subdivide the old face,  sans
    serif or blackletter categories. Crucially, in the practical exercises they use
    only the simplest faces, a sans (possibly Univers), and a serif (possibly Melior)
    \u2013 anything else would be counterproductive. \r\n\r\nHowever I think it's
    important that the traditional Vox classification gets mentioned <em> before </em>
    the more recent schemes suggested by either Nick above or the FontShop online
    that 'capture their (student) fancy' \u2013 the issue here is that everyone needs
    to know the standard terms of reference, before they reinvent the categories to
    their own satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe assignment I teach requires students to research
    and come up with their own choices for showing examples of what these categories
    look like. And then layout the results in a 16 page booklet. Perhaps this is the
    'killer reason' for using new, contemporary faces instead of the tired old standards,
    because (theoretically) it changes the learning mode to an active one.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Futura, it really is <em>not</em> better known as Verlag, nor was it designed
    by a communist (not that that should be any reason to discriminate against the
    typeface anyway). Both of you should read Christopher Burke's excellent <a/href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Paul-Renner-Typography-Christopher-Burke/dp/1568981589/sr=1-1/qid=1162687678/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2755155-9326530?ie=UTF8&s=books\">Paul
    Renner: The Art of Typography.</a>\r\n\r\n<em>What\u2019s the difference between
    a Garalde and an Aldine?</em>\r\n\r\nIn case this hasn't become apparent from
    the other posts, loosely speaking an Aldine is a Venetian (or Humanist) type from
    the Aldine Press of Aldus Manutius. Therefore the older kind of Old Style faces,
    approximately pre-1520 and generally Italian. Garalde is a compound name belonging
    to Vox, formed from GARamond and ALDus and refers to the next historical development
    of the Old Style faces approximately post-1520 and generally French...\r\n\r\nThe
    redsun timeline that Tiffany refers to above is just <em>not</em> accurate enough
    for me; I am fed up with students going there and then telling me they have found
    either a typeface or a category called 'gerald'! It also implies that the styles
    have discrete cut-off points in their development, which is patently untrue. Wish
    they'd update it."

  body: 'i''ve thought about this a bit more and i think that the reason Bringhurst''s
    classification system resontates with me is that it puts type into a larger context
    of historical art periods. When studying humanities in college it was interesting
    to see how the architecture, art, music, literature, &c. all incorporated the
    same sensibilities, i can see in my mind how the teacher might have incorporated
    types into this scheme as well, but unfortunately this aspect of culture was left
    out! (what a travesty) Since my education is not in design, i''ve never had the
    privelage of sitting in any typography classes, but i can see that too many faces
    might overwhelm a young student trying to grasp the basics. Rather than Helvetica,
    I''ll take Thomas'' idea a bit further and say perhaps limit the students to 1
    [[superfamily]] such as [[Thesis]]. If it were me, i might choose [[Fedra]], but
    maybe that''s another sub-discussion we might have: Which superfamily might best
    serve students learning typography in an intro level class?'
