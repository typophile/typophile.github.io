  many options but not this exact one. How about the base font used without the bevel?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    Refrigerator, as an alternative for the base.

    that is specific to some machinery of theirs or even some pre-digital system.\r\n\r\nPrismatic
    is another term for this effect, especially in the sign industry. [[http://signdna.com/shop/index.php?main_page=index&cPath=1_10&zenid=35d97d8e3f19671a9dad6b394bb72893|Sign

    a full character set for any of them.\r\nLetterhead Fonts' [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/quadrex.php|Quadrex]]
    is fairly close if you use the alternate A. They have a tutorial on creating a
    [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/tutorials/prismaticeffects/index.php|prismatic
    effect]]. You could apply that to something like one of the heavy weights of [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/tutorials/prismaticeffects/index.php|Agency
    Gothic]]. \r\n\r\n"

    to see on the web site, but the printed sample in their catalog gives the idea.\r\n\r\nHoefler
