    from an ordinary shvah which is defined as a shvah-na?

  body: "The Radak says the t'nu'ot ge'dol'lot, and t'nu'ot ke'tan'not, define what
    is and is not a shvah-na and shvah-nach.\r\n\r\nSome people mistakenly thing that
    a t'nu'ah is a sound pattern, and can not define what is and is not a shvah-na
    and shvah-nach by analysis of context. Of course, this is an incorrect understanding
    of what is a t'nu'ah.\r\n\r\nAccording to the view of Rabbi (Shlomo) Zalman (of)
    Henna (Henau), a shvah-na and shvah-nach can in deed be defined by analysis of
    context.\r\n\r\nAs Prof. Aron Dotan of Tel Aviv University (retired) told me explicitly,
    \"everything is in the nikkud\".\r\n\r\nRabbi Zalman Henna defines a shvah-nah
    as a shvah which follows a t'nu'ot ge'dola, and shvah-nach as a shvah which follows
    a t'nu'ah ke'tan'nah.\r\n\r\nHere is his chart from Henna's book, \"Yesod HaNikkud\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tnuot_6354.JPG]"
