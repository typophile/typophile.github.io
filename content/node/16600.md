  Advertisers are using it like it is going out of style and clothing designers are
  using Blackletters as if they are logos. \r\n\r\nI asked Armin at Under Consideration
  if he should revisit a blog he did in April on the poularity of Blackletter. He
  responded by saying, \u201CBlackletter is at its peak on mainstream, it can, sadly,
  only go downhill from here. It became too trendy for its own good.\u201D\r\n\r\nHow
  can a typeface that is over 500 years old be considered going downhill?!!\r\n\r\nWhy
  is Blackletter so popular right now? Where did this stronghold on popular culture
  come from? And don\u2019t tell me that the Germans are the influence.\r\n"

    is not a \"typeface,\" but a whole family of scripts. Some styles are more popular
    than others, with the [[textura]] variety being the forerunner and maybe [[fraktur]]
    coming in at second place, but a lot of blackletter is still fairly obscure, imo.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    blackletter is so popular now for the same reason that other scripts are: i think
    it's a backlash against the \"techno\" style: whereas evertything used to be cool
    if it were futuristic and seemingly made by machine, people now want to be able
    to feel the influence of the human hand in their design. Of course, scientific
    studies could prove all my ramblings above are just bunk, but that's my gut reaction."

    I think its popularity has proven to be cyclical over the years.

  body: "Yeah, Chris is right. I actually think that we talk about blackletter quite
    a lot. I know that blackletter is all over the place now, but I don't think its
    a new fad\u2026 I think that fad has been running more or less pretty strong since
    about 1991. You might as well go and ask Miles Newlyn why he drew Savage Black\u2026
    maybe the \"trend\" is even older\u2026 Didn't Licko start Totally Gothic is in
    1988?\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause for the blackletter fad is, it certainly is *not*
    the Germans. German designers won't touch the stuff with a ten-foot pole. This
    is US driven, primarily, although the stuff can be seen all over North, Central,
    and South America, plus the UK and some of continental Europe."

    section here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/forum/11 _\r\nBut something is wrong with
    it - it's missing\r\nmost of the content! Please fix it guys.\r\n\r\nIf blackletter
    is indeed a fading fad now, maybe that means it's high time to take it deeper?*
    Also, I hope the Germans jump in - they should in fact be leading the movement.\r\n\r\n*

  body: "I saw an interview on MuchMusic (Canada's MTV) about 10 years ago, I think
    it was with a metal band from Sao Paulo. Anyway, the guy said Blackletter was
    like Europe's ethnic thing, now that the Latin had become globalized.\r\n\r\nThat's
    the same way the Siberian (?) throat singer who did \"Levee breaks\" said that
    Led Zeppelin was, from his perspective, world music. Or Memphis Minnie at least.\r\n\r\nSo
    blackletter is historic, ethnic, gothic (in every sense).\r\n\r\nThe present vogue
    is not necessarily nasty gangsta/satanic/ethnic/historicist though, a lot of it
    is pure formality, to do with the fabulous flourishes. Go Marian! (Same vibe as
    Spencerian flourishing.)\r\n\r\nIt's such a rich vein, capable of holding so many
    meanings. "
