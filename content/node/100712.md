  body: There's at least 4 different font here but I guess you're talking about the
    one used for main logo "peski". Anyway, you'll probably not like what I'm going
    to say but looks custom to me. You could take any generic sans of your choice,
    from Futura (Bitstream and Berthold versions look closer), Twentieth Century,
    Neutraface, Avenir or Century Gothic (used to write "NEWS" on right). Start with
    oblique (or not), shear it (or not), add an outline stroke to round it, extend
    /k ascender (depending on base font), recreate /p (probably the hardest) and /i
    dot (from /i?).

  body: "I think the \u2018P\u2019 is simply the capital, lowered and with the vertical
    stem extended downwards. Then the customisation is pretty simple."
