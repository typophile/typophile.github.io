body: "I am in my 2nd yr of a BA Hons Graphic Design course and was wondering if anyone
  could give me tips on how to handle the disseratation and what topic taht would
  be interesting to focus on. It can be based on advertising, branding etc. Anything
  taht we want. i was thinking of doing advertising and how advertisers target different
  products at male and female without any regards to gender stereotyping that was
  an issue in the 1960's and beyond i.e. washing up liquids aimed at women but now,
  the recent one shown in the UK for Fairy (name of washing up liquid) is the famous
  chef Ainsley Harriet so therefore, women are not the sole target audience. I have
  one issue though an taht is for an advertising essay we had to do, i have done it
  on a product with similar ideas but thsi woulod be in more depth. Do you think that
  i should leave the idea and choose another because having similar ideas in my portfolio
  won't do me any good. What do you think? Can you think of anything else? \r\n\r\nOption
  2) Should i focus on a a particular brand and its branding including all the advertising
  campaigns etc and compare and contrast how they targeted their audience before and
  how they do it now? There HAS to be a reference to the present times so what do
  you think. I need help. "

  body: It could be typography too as long as it can relate to this present moment.
    What about rejected adverts? Why tehy had to be banned etc. Is there enough to
    write 6000 word essay? OR how sexism and sexuality is used in advertising, art
    work etc and its power of influence? What do you think? Thanks.

    I\u2019d recommend that you do your dissertation on a subject that you have views
    on or interest in, if only to keep it from becoming too much of a chore. I also
    wouldn't worry about your portfolio, a dissertation counts towards your college
    work but it really needn\u2019t be in your portfolio mentioning the subject in
    an application letter might be useful but potential employers are unlikely to
    ask to see it.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "typequake and timd, I think the confusion is that on the eastern side of
    the pond, there's not a categorical difference betwixt thesis and dissertation.
    \ On the western side, thesis is for Masters, and dissertation is for Doctorate,
    and generally for Bachelors whilst occasionally called a thesis as well (much
    to the chagrin of Masters candidates, as BA \"theses\" are rarely more than about
    20-25, the average term paper for MA students), it's often called an honours research
    paper or something to that effect.  In HS it's often that or an \"extended essay\"
    as I believe the IBO's terminology is.\r\n\r\nOne thing that has always interested
    me that you might be able to work in to, especially if you're a fan of RRT or
    Stylistics/Narratology is perhaps looking at the effect of typeface on readers
    in books or advertising.  Take a genre (thriller novels, beauty product adverts)
    and examine the fount choices.  Back during the <em>vanguardia</em> of Latin America,
    one of the primary theoretical break-throughs was breaking the quality of the
    text into three distinct qualities:\r\n<ul><li>Semantic</li><li>Phonetic</li><li><strong>Graphic</strong></li></ul>\r\nThat
    is to say, while traditionally only the semantic quality had been looked at and/or
    used for the creation of poetry (phonetic was only used inasmuch as the poetic
    required, e.g., creating rhyme or rhythm), but by focusing in on the phonetic,
    for instance, they were able to create poems that superficially had little to
    no semantic meaning (aka \"gibberish\") but had a phonetic quality that was beyond
    anything formerly written.  The graphic quality gave birth to the concrete poetry
    that Latin America is so well known for, but it extends beyond the simple arrangement
    of the words.  (An author that mastered and used all three together is Vicente
    Huidobro.) For example, in a paper I was writing on electronic poetry, a genre
    which many established critics are still unsure of, I used Ibarra as my fount,
    because it was based on old Iberian printing presses.  Subconsciously, the readers
    of my paper, most of whom would be specialising in far older poetry, say, Garcilasso
    de la Vega, or G\xF3ngora, would instantly relate the older \"true\" poetry with
    the electronic poetry on which I was writing.  \r\n\r\nApplying it to modern day
    advertising or book/pamphlet design could really give you a lot to talk about,
    and you'd be able to easily fill up 6k words in analyses. \r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro

    my mind that as a second year student, you feel the need to ask typophilers to
    help with a focus for your dissertation. \r\n\r\nIn my area of studies (creative
    writing) you are expected, by 2nd year, to be able to come up with a thesis and
    direction for your papers on your own. If nothing else, your studies are supposed
    to teach you to think critically for yourself, not simply execute a paper based
    on other people's ideas. The hard part is *always* struggling with the direction
    and focus and logic of what you want to say. You may get through your degree by
    asking others to feed you the ideas, your teacher might even not have a problem
    with you doing so, but this practice will not serve you well in the long run.
    \ \r\n\r\nSit down, work out a connection or concept or argument you want to make,
    draw up an outline for your paper, write a thesis statement, and post *that*.
    You'll get better feedback and you'll be able to say you did the thinking on your
    own.\r\n\r\nK."
