body: "I've been working on a texture enhancement mod for The Legend of Zelda: Majora's
  Mask, but I ran into trouble sourcing the font that appears in most of the game's
  menus. The same font also shows up in the menus for Ocarina of Time. Unfortunately,
  since these games are quite old now, all the textures with this font are at a pretty
  low resolution, which might make identifying the font more difficult, but I've provided
  as many examples as possible to aid in the search.\r\n\r\nI've included three images
  to help identify the font. The first image is a screenshot of the game with an example
  of the font. The second image is a collection of all the textures I could find in
  Majora's Mask and Ocarina of Time that contain the font. The final image is a makeshift
  alphabet of all the characters I could find of this font using the game's textures
  (The red characters are in a different font. These were characters I couldn't find
  in any of the game's textures).\r\n\r\nI should note that it's quite possible that
  because this is a Japanese-developed game, this font could be a Japanese font that
  includes Latin characters. The font used in these games for character dialogue,
  Chairo, turned out to be a Japanese font, so I wouldn't be surprised if this was
  one too. Probably the most noticeable things I found in this font is the unique
  way the tail on the \"Q\" juts out from the bottom and how the characters have a
  pretty uniform width.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for any help you can give!\r\n"

    body: Now I feel a bit silly, having found Chiaro before for the dialogue font,
      and somehow not realizing that that it's the same font as the menus. I guess
      I didn't notice because of the difference in resolution and each character being
      separate in the textures for the dialogue. Sorry about that.
