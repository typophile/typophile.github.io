body: "I am working on a cover work for a release titled ; Jammic n Flip - In My Mind\r\n\r\nI
  have been going through my suitcase and came across this Russian font which coincidently
  matched this as Jammic is half Russian half Korean.\r\n\r\n\r\nwas wondring if there
  are any Russian speaking typophile memebrs who can tell me if the image included
  make any sense? if not why? and perhaps a recommendation for a alt Russian font.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
