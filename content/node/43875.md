  variety is coming back to the Web. With the release of Safari 3.1 for MacOS and
  Windows, Apple\u2019s web browser now supports font embedding for websites. Now
  millions of web users can view websites the way they were intended to be. \r\n\r\nSafari
  3.1 for Windows and Mac supports the embedding of \u201Csfnt fonts\u201D (TrueType,
  OpenType PS, OpenType TT) using the font-face declaration. Technically the fonts
  are not embedded in the website, but they are simply linked like an image file.
  Thus the fonts need to be stored on a public server. Since you cannot upload commercial
  fonts to a public webserver, you are limited to freeware fonts. \r\n\r\nFDI fonts.info
  believes in the future of web fonts, so we decided to provide webdesigners with
  a set of high-quality web fonts supporting a wide range of character encodings.
  Graublau Sans Web regular and bold were designed by Georg Seifert. The fonts are
  optimized for screen use and support a wide range of character encodings, for example
  ISO 8859-15 (Western), ISO 8859-2 (Central European), ISO 8859-3 (Turkish, Maltese
  and Esperanto), ISO 8859-4 (Baltic), ISO 8859-5 (Cyrillic), ISO 8859-7 (Greek) and
  ISO 8859-10 (Scandinavian). Both fonts may be embedded in any website free of charge.\r\n\r\nDownload
