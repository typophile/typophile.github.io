  to meeting once a week at a local pub to continue our discussions about type. (Also,
  some beer drinking is involved.)\r\n\r\nThis is a general invitation for any others
  in the Calgary area who would like to accompany us. The conversation isn't always
  about serifs and such, and there are other people at the table who aren't typophiles.
  Everybody is welcome. Bring a friend, bring a spouse. Bring a biker gang. No appetite
  for beer? Still welcome.\r\n\r\nOther typophiles passing through the city (yeah,
  right!) are also invited.\r\n\r\nInterested? Feel free to contact Linda Cunningham
  or myself for details."

    evenings, around 6:00\r\n<em>Where:</em> The Cat & Fiddle pub (16th Ave. & 5th

    come over and introduce yourselves.\r\n<em>Fun-Time Activities:</em> This week
    I'm showing up with Veer's latest promo. It's a jigsaw puzzle. And what could
    be more fun than sitting in a pub, assembling a jigsaw puzzle??? (Or maybe Veer-folk
    could show up to explain why they think badly done photo collages  make good marketing
    pieces.)\r\n"

    and there's a lot of things to do. Granted it isn't the city-wide party it was
    15 years ago. But I would recommend it as a good time to visit. Bring raingear,
    though. The weather is Calgary is very fickle in June.\r\n\r\nAnd stay away from
    the crazy people."

    to city slickers.  :-(\r\n\r\n(You can still learn to milk a cow at Stampede,
    except it's a full-sized, plastic cow so no one -- cow or human -- gets hurt.
    And if you go into the barns, there's all kinds of signs around saying no one
    is liable if anything happens, and \"don't forget to wash your hands when you
    leave.\" That sure wasn't how the west was tamed: a century ago, men were men
    and sheep were nervous.)"

  body: "A short report after a successful meeting:\r\n\r\nWe managed to assemble
    a goodly portion of Veer's jigsaw puzzle. We were hampered by the overall painted
    artwork on the surface of Table 49. It interfered with the {same color palette
    of the} puzzle. There was some beer drinking and throwing of jigsaw pieces involved.
    But the typographic bits of the puzzle got done. \r\n\r\nWe're sending a package
    off to Veer which includes a large portion of the puzzle (assembled or not), some
    beer-stained coasters, and possibly a few well-gnawed chicken bones.\r\n\r\nLex
    was unavailable because of previous commitments, so we put his name to the courier
    waybill."

    of a classic summer biz style would be the pink/powder blue seersucker suit. And
    a bow tie. When I first arrived in T.O. in the 1970s, there would still be a few
    around on Bay St. The summer version with shorts and a straw hat, maybe even a
    boater (very Mad. Av.) was way cool. But I guess you could wear seersucker with
    cowboy boots and a Stetson? No doubt Veer has a stock shot..."
