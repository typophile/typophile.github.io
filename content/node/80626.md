  font. \r\n\r\nHowever, is it possible to replace glyphs in one OpenType font to
  glyphs from another OpenType font. Is there a python script available for that?
  Or is there some other way to achieve that? Thank you in advance."

    I'm not talking about replacing glyphs via Fontlab. \r\n\r\nI want to be able
    to replace specific glyphs in already generated OTF from a different OTF that
    are in the same folder for example. I know that if I apply a script I can change
    f f l to a ligature ffl in one particular font. But is it possible to control
    a font with a script from within a different font,.. being able to replace, let's
    say, a lowercase \"g\" from one font with another \"g\" from a different font?
    I hope this explains. Thanks."

  body: "Nycgraphiste,\r\n\r\nwithout a high-level font editor such as FontLab Studio,
    it can be quite tricky. Especially with OpenType PS (.otf) fonts which rely on
    the compression of the CFF table through subroutines. \r\n\r\nIt's possible, using
    the FontTools/TTX Python toolkit, but it requires quite a lot of low-level knowledge
    of the OpenType font format. \r\n\r\nOne solution might be to try compiling FontForge
    as a Python module (which unfortunately I haven't been able to do on a Linux server),
    and/or use the UFO/GLIF format to exchange the glyph data. \r\n\r\nIt's not trivial.
    But yes, it can be done. "

  body: "Twardoch,\r\n\r\nI meant doing it in Fontlab Studio. So how is it possible
    to do it via FS? Is it rather complicated or not to attach such a script to a
    font that would work on other fonts, because I'm not an advanced (or intermediate)
    scripter?\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that there is a specific OpenType font created
    for a particular brand. The concept is to use different fonts (in publication
    materials) alongside the custom font but some of the glyphs (characters in the
    brand name) will always be replaced with the corresponding glyphs from that custom
    font. Cheers."
