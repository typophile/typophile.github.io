  a presentation I am working on. I have looked and rejected Clarendon, Caslon, and
  Goudy Old Style.\r\n\r\nThe serif is mostly used for pull quotes, etc. Not really
  for primary content. A crappy example here: http://nathanherald.com/tmp/unit-plus-baskerville.png\r\n\r\nThanx
  for any and all suggestions."

    Meta Serif may work better.\r\n\r\nAnd Unit Slab! \r\nI don't know how I missed
    that, it's beautiful. \r\n\r\nThanx a lot for the suggestions."

  body: "Christian Schwartz, discussing the direction for Meta Serif with Erik Spiekermann:\r\n\u201C[M]y
    grand plan (and the underlying reason why I think Meta Serif should be an Antiqua)
    is to draw Unit Serif as well, and let that one be a real Egyptian. [\u2026] In
    the end, I think we\u2019d end up with a serif and slab that could be used together,
    and they\u2019d be compatible with both FF Meta and FF Unit.\u201D \u2014 <a href=\"http://metaserif.com/story/\">metaserif.com</a>\r\n\u2018Unit
    Serif\u2019 later was released as Unit Slab \u2013 after Meta Serif. But yes,
    Unit (Sans) came before those two.\r\nSee also FontShop\u2019s blurb for the <a
