    downside is that it has the most abominable interface design of the twenty-first
    century."

  body: Under OPTIONS &gt; General Options &gt; Open and Save, fill in <strong>Auto-Save
    Fonts Every 10 minutes</strong>, and check <strong>Create Backup File</strong>.
    Then, manually save the file at regular intervals, which will keep the .bak file
    up-to-date.

  body: What about [[https://www.dropbox.com/|Dropbox]]? 2 Gb for free, and it automatically
    saves the last ten versions or so of every file. It has saved my day several times,
    and 2 Gb is a plenty of space for .vfb files.

  body: Hi, Yep I had already set backups and saving every 10 minute. I use something
    called Chronosync to do daily syncs. Have now set it up to sync every half hour
    whilst working on fontlab. The only explanation must be that it crashed at the
    precise time it was saving, leaving half a file or something, which osx could
    then not read. Thanks for the advice anyway.

  body: I use a local git repository for almost anything worthy, it is not a backup
    system per se but I just do a commit after any significant piece of work and can
    return back to any revision any time, for real projects I combine that with [[http://groups.google.com/group/linux.dev.kernel/msg/76ae734d543e396d|Linus
    backup law]] though not ftp exactly :p.
