body: "This is kind of a long shot, but I came across a site for a designer that is
  attributed to have started highly ornate typography designs. He takes simple serif/sans
  serif titles then adds ornate swirls/elements, etc. ...I wanted to show it to coworkers
  but I can't recall his name or site or where I found him (through a publication
  or blog). I know the description is vague but if anyone has ideas, please let me
  know. The closest design I could find that slightly resembles his work, but not
  to the extreme of what he does is the new Beatles \"Love\" logo (minus the silhouettes).

  body: Wow, you guys are good! Beware tho that (if subway ads are any indication)
    the swirly silo vaguely psychedelic look is going to feel very 2006/7 pretty soon.
    Current ads for the School of Visual Art and Samsung's Share a Soundtrack ad campaigns
    both use this style with flourishes, candy colors, flowers, etc almost to the
    point of being indistinguishable from each other.

  body: "Yes, that might be indeed. But the good thing about Si Scott is that he draws
    it by hand, on paper or transparents.\r\nThe style is probably going to be imitated
    a lot the coming period, but those will probably be inferior to the handdrawn
    originals."

  body: Yeah, I always like Marian Bantjes her work. Also alot of hand lettering going
    on in her work. I agree that she improves her work all the time, more so then
    Si Scott. But who knows what he comes up with in the future.
