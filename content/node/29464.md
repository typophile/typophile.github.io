body: "hi everyone,\r\n\r\ni am designing a logo for a small company called Analysis
  Factory which provides dashboards to other companies for quick data visualization;
  i.e. to monitor the finances of the company. The clients can update an Excel spreadsheet,
  and the dashboard shows them the current charts and graphs in an interactive dashboard.\r\n(http://analysisfactory.com/solutions.htm)\r\n\r\ni
  have done a logo that they immediately liked, so now i am trying to narrow it down
  and work out the details. please review the 4 options (4 pages in various colors)
  and offer some suggestions for improvement. as far as kerning, i know i still need
  to do that!\r\n\r\nthe client wants a stacked version and a horizontal version."

    the one sans-box as I don't see the box really adding anything.\r\n\r\nThe type
    is nice too. Is that Helvetica Rounded? It's trendy, but I have a soft spot for
    it.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like is the balance between the mark and the type.\r\n\r\nIn
    your first set, the mark is too large in relation to the type. In your second
    set, it's too small in relation to the type. I think you need to aim for something
    in the middle. Also, perhaps give the mark a bit more space in relation to the
    type. Give it some breathing room.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Are you locked up with the typeface? When looking at your small jpg's seemed
    good at first glance. But after I saw it was helvetica rounded it just felt a
    little too playful for a serious company. Every time I see helvetica rounded I
    think of \"playschool\" or toys in general. \r\nIf you are locked up on the typeface
    I might try to match the roundness of your icon corners, meaning make the icon
    rounder. If you are not locked up you can try another typeface that matches that
    shape, a bit more squared but round. Or you could even bring regular sans  typeface
    and then play with making it's corners rounder. Could be interesting and I would
    try a wide typeface to match the width of the \"F\" on the icon or again try to
    match the icon to your typeface.\r\nOverall looks interesting, play more with
    the type, stack it, try \"TitleCase\" since it looks like you have an Upercase
    \"F' in your icon instead of lowercase etc.\r\nWhen you place the icon next to
    the icon horizontally it reads \"Fanalisisfactory\" be careful with that, perhaps
    stacked on the side but align the bottom to the \"x\" height of your type.\r\n\r\nGood
    work, hope this helps.\r\n\r\n\r\nKco"

    Not futuristic, but also not retro.\r\n\r\nThey have come back to tell me that
    they do like page 2, which Ratbaggy noted above as working well. \r\n\r\nBelow
    i am attaching some more font explorations (I'm not telling you which font is
    which because it shouldn't matter, as long as it works!). \r\n\r\nI still think
    VAG Rounded works well.\r\n\r\nAs far as color, they like either red or blue.
    which do you guys prefer and why?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/af-bw_4861.gif]"

    \u2013 ie. the side angles appear to differ and give the illusion of (a slight)
    perspective if the right side of the F was extended out fractionally it might
    help, then perhaps introduce type that echoes the angles of the marque to create

      use uppercase A and F and the rest lowercase (Analysis Factory), maybe this
      creates more unity between type and mark (consisting of uppercase).  Just a
      thought, though...\r\n\r\nI still don't like VAG (to playfull) but I can't think

    to use this typeface or another that is similar, the mark should be positioned
    differently. Maybe just raise it a little (bottom of the mark in line with the
    crossbar of the \"A\") and nudge it a bit to the right so the spacing look right.\r\n\r\nAloha!"

    agree that the type must be kept lowercase, and I don't think any of the suggested
    replacements yet work as well as your original choice.\r\n\r\nA few things I might
    suggest: For the unframed stacked version, you might try shifting the type to
    the left a little to align the division between words with the corresponding division
    in the mark. For the unframed horizontal version, swap the words' colors, diminishing
    the \"Fanalysis\" problem and helping to associate each word with its counterpart

    \r\n\r\nBelow is the best thing I could think of. Foundry Monoline (http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_monoline/monoline_medium.html).
    It is similar to Eurostile, but better (in my opinion). It's strokes are fairly
    equal and balances well with the icon. It is structured but has slight curve like
    the icon. It also isn't distracting from the logo.\r\n\r\nI would customize the
    font by taking the tail out of the \"t\" and maybe making the stem and descender
    in the \"y\" straight to match the icon.\r\n\r\nYou need to move the icon from
    the center. Everything is so symetric and boring. Moving it to the left gives
    it energy and motion.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/foundry-monoline3_5684.gif]\r\n"
