body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nSo, I'm working with plain old Utopia in news copy right
  now. It is set 9/10 and the columns are 120 points wide. There are plans for a redesign
  later this year, and I had originally thought to just upgrade to Utopia Opticals,
  but wondered if there weren't other options for text setting. Sometimes the 9pt
  Utopia feels too wide (Is roughly 5 words/29 characters per line too tight?), and
  I'm reluctant to make the type smaller.\r\n\r\nSo I have been searching and I've
  come up with:\r\n[[http://fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/kepler_std_semicondensed_caption/|Kepler
  Semicondensed Caption]] (Onscreen this looks to be a better size/grade/weight than
  reg)\r\n[[http://fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/typetogether/karmina_ot/|Karmina]]\r\n[[http://fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/shinntype/pratt_pro_family/|Pratt]]
  (Only a pinch narrower as I see it)\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tipotype/quiroga-serif/|Quiroga]]
  (Too nontraditional?)\r\n\r\nKnow of any others?\r\n\r\nRecommendations or suggestions
  are welcome. The plan is to pair this with Proxima Nova as the sans, if that matters."

  body: "Utopia has quite long descenders compared with many news faces.\r\nPratt,
    for instance, has both shorter ascenders and descenders than Utopia, so will produce
    a more open look than Utopia at 9 on 10, or may be set at 9 on 9.5.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/worldwide.html\">Worldwide</a> is condensed. You
    could set it 8.5 on 9.5 and have a similar apparent size to 9 on 10 Utopia, with
    considerably more copy.\r\n\r\nFor something different, <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/goodchild.html\">Goodchild</a>
    is a news Jenson, and has a greater characters-per-pica count than Utopia.\r\n\r\n(Shinntype
    news text faces.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    good results with this in the past. Another try is Greta Narrow. '

  body: "Aaron \u2014 Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll like these stylistically, but
    both <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/newspaper/fonts/serif/text/BureauRoman/\">Bureau
    Roman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/newspaper/fonts/serif/text/MillerDaily/\">Miller
    Daily</a> are narrower than Utopia at the same nominal size. FWIW.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BureauRomMillerDailyUtopia_4498.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n(You
    can finetune the overall color with different grades. I just happened to pick
    Two for comparison.)"

  body: "Thank you all for the suggestions.\r\n\r\nNick \u2014 I had not considered
    Goodchild for news. I very much like the look of it. Are you planning a pro release
    of it? Any dailies using Goodchild that you're aware of that might be on Newseum?\r\n\r\nIgor
    \u2013 I hesitate to scale the glyphs, because I'm already allowing my H&J settings
    to scale glyphs \xB14%. I suppose just scaling all the type from the start would
    be more consistent. Squishing it slightly just feels off to me.\r\n\r\nKent \u2013
    I like the warmth/softness of BureauRoman. Unfortunately, both families are out
    of the budget range for our modest weekly.\r\n\r\nIs roughly 5 words/29 characters
    per line too tight? A rule of thumb I was taught in school is 1.5 lowercase alphabets,
    which would be 39 characters. I improved the text last year by taking it from
    9.5/11 Utopia down to 9/11. The paper had not changed its body style to reflect
    the narrowing columns (as a result of narrowing web widths).\r\n\r\nThanks again."
