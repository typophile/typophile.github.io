body: "Any thoughts on deciding on a method for breaking poetry across pages without
  altering the flow of the poem?\r\n\r\nI'm designing a book-length poem in sections.
  The line, verse, and section lengths vary greatly, which is the cause of my difficulty.
  I've tried many methods of breaking the pages, but none are entirely satisfying,
  either causing uneven space at the page bottoms or widow/orphan lines and short
  verses. I'm wondering if anyone has a helpful way to think through this, or perhaps
  examples that are worth looking at. \r\n\r\n(In contrast to my poem, all the printed
  poems I've looked at either have sections of similar length, allowing a consistent
  number of sections per page, or no verse-breaks within sections, allowing the text
  to flow naturally to the next page.)"

  body: Could you talk to the poet about it? The varying lengths of the different
    components may have been a structural and rhythmic choice on their part, not unlike
    how a designer makes decisions about layout and pace in their typography. By talking
    to them, you'll be able to make a better interpretation of their creative intentions,
    and use that interpretation to inform your own decisions.

    be mistaken for endings.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, verse typography has conventions
    for this, by capitalizing the first letter of a line, putting paragraph spacing
    between verses, and using raised caps or small caps at the start of sections/the
    whole."

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions. They are all excellent ones, but unfortunately
    not quite what I was after; I think I need to explain my problem more clearly.
    First of all, I am the poet\u2014so my lack of objectivity may be part of the
    problem! Essentially this is just a variation of the orphans/widows vs. uneven
    pages dilemma, but the downsides of each option are magnified due to the particular
    form of the poem. \r\n\r\nThe issue is not clarity but a smooth reading experience.
    Large spaces at the bottoms of certain pages visually gives more importance to
    those breaks, even though other elements in the design make it perfectly obvious
    that this is not intended. The alternative of separating a first or last line
    from the rest of its section also takes away from the experience of that section
    as a single unit. (The section lengths range from about one quarter of a page
    to a whole page.)\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not trying to achieve square pages, just pages
    that end in the same general range. The best solution I\u2019ve come up with is
    to force a page break early only to avoid the following two situations: 1) having
    a verse break across a page; or 2) having a single first or last line of a section
    alone at the bottom or top of a page.  But it still doesn\u2019t look great to
    me, as most pages end close to the bottom margin but some over an inch higher.
    (It\u2019s a 6x9 in. book) Perhaps going past the margin in those cases would
    be preferable, but I\u2019m not crazy about that either.\r\n"
