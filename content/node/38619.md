  that we're having.\r\n\r\nWe have a new font from HTJ - it's the font Gotham in
  OTF, we are using for a client.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we have made some documents
  with the font, using Gotham Book, Gotham Ultra and Gotham Bold.\r\nSuddenly after
  a couple of days, the Gotham Book is displayed as a Gotham Black Italic on the screen
  , on print and PDF.\r\n\r\nHowever when you select the text, InDesign shows that
  it is a Gotham Book (as it's supposes to be). But text is Black Italic!\r\nNow if
  you choose the \"Find font\" menu in InDesign the Gotham Book is named \"Gotham\"
  not Gotham Book or Black Italic!! Only Gotham. Wired. And if your try to replace
  the font - nothing happens.. even if you replace the font to eg. Times.. the font
  is replaced to Times. When trying to replace back to a Gotham Book, the displays
  as Black Italic.\r\n\r\nAny way, so we tryied to copy the contents to a new document,
  same, the problem is carried forward. However if you make a new text box in the
  new document, and aplly it a a Book it displays fine (only that text box) until
  you save the file and opens the file again, then the new textbox is Black Italic!!!!\r\n\r\nWe
  have found that exporting the document to an INX file and open the INX in InDesign
  again the fonts are correct. But this is not a solution since this we have a huge
  amount of documents that we copy from.\r\n\r\nWe're using Mac 10.4.9/10 and InDesign
  CS (not CS2 or CS3). Same things happens and on a windows pc. We have cleared every
  font cache, testet on 10.5 and a fresh install of 10.4 - moved all fonts out etc.\r\nWe
  have opened the documents in CS2 and CS3 - here the problem is gone and everything
  is fine. We're using some automatic stuff which only works in CS...\r\n\r\nAnyone
  have any idea on wy this is happening?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nThomas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    with you since October 19, is that correct? Our last note in the file says that
    we haven't been able to recreate the problem here, using the same builds of the
    software.\r\n\r\nThomas Phinney at Adobe has confirmed that there is a bug in
    InDesign which relates to weights called \"Book,\" but I don't know that this
    is connected with the problem you're having. I'm asking Andy in my office to follow
    up with you to see if there's a way we can confirm that this problem is, or is
    not, related.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nJonathan Hoefler"

    same\" as \"regular\" can get confused, such as \"book\" and \"regular.\")\r\n\r\nAlthough
    of course there are bound to be InDesign bugs I haven't heard of, I have not previously
    heard of this issue. At the very least, it is not a common problem across other
    fonts and installations.\r\n\r\nHave you tried purging all font caches, both Adobe
    and OS X?\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Th. Ph. -- I don't think it's a related bug either, but I was hoping that
    he might run some tests to confirm. But if new documents aren't exhibiting the
    problem, I'm really unsure how to proceed. I suppose purging the font caches couldn't
    hurt.

    you work on something else?"

  body: I had exactly the same kind of problem (Bold being displayed as Bold Italic)
    on CS1/Win2000 with several of my fonts, which I solved with the INX export/import
    trick. So I assume it is not related to that particular font.

    the above chart (kindly posted by Thomas to the Build forum earlier), note that
    for the horizontal grouping \"400 regular\", 900 heavy (also the value for Ultra)
    is outside the range.\r\nTherefore, perhaps the application does not consider
    Ultra to be part of the \"Book=400\" family, and is looking for a \"Regular\"
    to go with Ultra, and the next number down, Black Italic (800), is being designated
    thus.\r\nAnd, as a Gotham \"Regular\", it takes precedence over Gotham \"Book\",
    as the Regular of the family to display."

    you did for me, however I ended the test with Andy. \r\nSince there was no more
    to test. And not really any clue to what was going on.\r\n\r\nYour are correct
    in a new document the font works, however somewhere in the start of the process,
    \r\nthe font should have been changed. I can't reproduce that.\r\n\r\nTo Thomas
    Phinniy:  Are any ways repair a InDesign document, without doing the INX thing?
    Or some other way of getting this font out of the system in InDesign?\r\n\r\nFor
    the INX part, the thing is that we have also been experinece problems when INX'ing
    the file, some textboxs might get smaller and and you get the overflow icon, which
    means there are more hidden text in the box, this is manual task to go through
    the documents...\r\n\r\nAnd yes were have tried everything in Mac OS X. Purging
    fonts from the application, caches folders etc... notthing seems to work.\r\n\r\nThanks

    a "corrupt" text frame into a new file, or even when I copy/pasted text into a

    paste into a new document, Thomas? You seem to be able to reproduce the problem.'

    happened, the text may have been formatted with a font that didn't have a style
    name for the regular weight before being switched to Gotham. Is there a known
    bug in InDesign CS that could cause this, considering the fact that it doesn't
    occur in CS2 or CS3?\r\n\r\nIs there any way to get InDesign CS un-stuck from
    looking for the font family \"Gotham\" with the style \"\"? In Thomas' case, attempting
    to replace the font in the Find Font dialog doesn't work, once you try to either
    find an instance of the font or replace the font nothing happens.\r\n\r\nThank
    you!\r\nAndy"

  body: "Here is some information that might shine some light on the issue (but I
    don't know what the exact problem described here was).\r\nIn InDesign, we wanted
    faces to be somewhat independent from the families. We didn't want the older style
    \"bold\" & \"italic\" toggles because they were too limited, but thought some
    separation between the 2 would be useful with character styles, etc.  (<em>Today
    I think I would not have them separated at all.</em>)\r\nAnyway, in some fonts
    the regular face is called \"Regular\" in others, \"Roman\", in some it is an
    empty string. If we have text with \"Helvetica\" as the family, and \"\" as the
    face, we want it to work as expected when changing the family to \"Bembo\" which
    doesn't have a \"\" face, only \"Regular\".  So, ... there are some synonyms for
    regular:\r\n<strong>Roman, Regular, Book, Plain, Normal, R</strong><em> (for J
    fonts)</em> \r\nWe have a similar list of italic synonyms:\r\n<strong>Italic,
    Oblique, Slanted, Cursive, Inclined</strong>\r\n\r\nIt sounds like there might
    have been strange issues with the default face (default = empty string). "

    \ Won't do that again.\r\nThere are definitely bug fixes & heuristic improvements
    made to this area for CS2 & CS3 -- I couldn't list them off the top of my head,
    but this has been a problematic area over the years. \r\nHere is some additional
    detail that may explain it:\r\nFor each font family (e.g. Gotham) we create a
    table in the document that maps each face name to a postscript name. It sounds
    like in CS the table got screwed up somehow and the blank string got mapped to
    the postscript name for \"gotham black italic\".  INX recreates this table from
    scratch. The bug appears to be that this table is bad. (Copying text to a document
    that never used gotham can copy the bad table.) Perhaps the document was modified
    on a machine without a full installation of the font?\r\nEither way, it sounds
    like the correct answer is to upgrade if possible.  \r\n"

    with style-linking in typical Windows GDI applications which limit themselves
    to four-member families, and has nothing to do with behavior on Mac OS, nor with
    InDesign on any platform.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I am wondering if any of this is related to another misbehaviour in InDesign
    I noticed this week. I had to generate a number of fonts in Mac PS Type 1 format
    where roman and italic members are stylelinked. Some of these fonts have the words
    'Pi' and 'Exp' in their familynames (e.g. 'Myfont Exp' and 'Myfont Pi').\r\n\r\nThese
    fonts function perfectly in regular Cocoa apps like Pages and TextEdit and also
    in Microsoft apps like Word X. But in InDesign CS/CS2/CS3 (and other Adobe apps
    too) the font menu did not display them properly. The other fonts I generated
    are perfectly fine - 'Myfont Txt-Regular' and  'Myfont Txt-Italic' have one entry
    in the font menu with 'Regular' and 'Italic' in a submenu\u2013 but the ones named
    Pi and Exp have seperate entries in the font menu, and are not stylelinked at
    all.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that Adobe apps treat Exp and Pi fonts as something
    special, and I am curious what that is."

  body: "Hello All, \r\n\r\nFirst time post. I am very interested in the font knowledge
    that is abundant on this site. I have a similar problem with the font family of
    Gotham. Except my issue is we receive the files from a publisher in PDF format.
    They are using CS2 and exporting from it to pdf. We are a little different from
    print in that we need fonts to be searchable and the need to be able to bookmark
    the text. For some reason we are experiencing more problems lately with bad encoding
    of some fonts. Gotham is on top of our list recently. Every time we try to highlight
    and paste the text or bookmark it, it is creates bad characters. \r\n\r\nWhat
    happens when we bookmark the Gotham font, is Acrobat's 8 version of bad font.
    It's the alien in a box. This is an issue that we are coming across more and more.
    A little background on the PDF's is they are untouched in the sense that we are
    not distilling, optimizing, enhancing, or any other compression. We are using
    the original files exported from InDesign CS2.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help or suggestions
    it would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nErik\r\n"
