  in the letterpress pre-print market:\r\nwww.bleisetzer.de\r\n\r\nBut although I
  am a writer of short stories and others and I am just preparing my new literature
  blog at www.preussen-blog.de (its not ready yet, sorry.)\r\n\r\nRight now I am working
  on an essay about the smell of languages.\r\nI for myself associate e.g. french
  with love & erotic, finish with a motor bycicle and so on... I think its always
  depending on what you individually learned in your first 20 years and what your
  special country culture says to you, what you associate to a language.\r\n\r\nBut
  now the question, where I'ld like to ask for your help:\r\n\r\nWhat do you as a
  non german associate with the sound of german language?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for your help. I hope, I do not disturb too much with my OT question.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

  body: "The main German media stereotype when I was growing up (England in the '50s
    and '60s) was the sadistic Nazi/SS officer in war movies that demonized Germans.
    And Hitler ranting. So I have been indoctrinated with the impression that the
    German language is harsh and evil. The Tool recording plays on that, with words
    that are completely innocuous made to sound like a satanic ritual.\r\n\r\nCar
    ads here (Canada) are disgusting, with their clich\xE9 of the humourless German
    engineer. It's not just Japanese or American manufacturers who exploit that stereotype,
    but some German too, e.g. Audi, with a seriously guttural man's voice saying the
    tagline \"Vorsprung durch Technik\" (Progress through technology).  \r\n\r\nAs
    an aside, I find that English spoken with a German accent is very pleasant. That
    may well be because of the Germans I have known in recent years, in my dealings
    with FontShop.\r\n\r\nEven more of an aside, I thought Kate Winslet's German accented
    English in <em>The Reader</em> was brilliant.\r\n\r\n"

    and Dutch seem harsher (and the former moreso). Of course, it is entirely possible
    that English sounds the same to a Francophone."

  body: "> fran\xE7ais aux hommes\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a slightly different saying
    but I won\u2019t quote it here\u2026 ;)\r\n\r\nSeriously, the clich\xE9 about
    Germany/Germans I\u2019m generally confronted with is either ridden by the image
    of the brutish Pickelhaubenmaschinenmensch (wow, this word sounds like machine
    gun staccato!) or the one of a slightly deranged dreamer who\u2019s getting bitchy
    as soon as you\u2019re talking about his nationality. Actually, I can identify
    with both, getting something positive out of both these clich\xE9s.\r\n\r\nThe
    scent of German is dominated by motor oil and decay. Maybe due to the fact that
    motor oil and decay smell somehow stronger than the scents renowned as more \u2018humane\u2019.
    Or maybe because we lack the ability to mask the bad smell properly by spraying
    rose petal or bubble gum scented air freshener.\r\n\r\nAlso check this great film:\r\n\r\nhttp://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7688523464781787807&ei=7qmYS4_jJqLe2wLAp63ZAg&q=faust+film&hl=de&view=1&dur=3#"
