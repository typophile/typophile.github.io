  body: Also like FF Hydra. I've been struggling to identify this for the Book Cover
    Archive as well. Guessing it's custom.

  body: Thanks for the input. I think you're probably right Stephen. I love the "squarer
    finish" and I think that "R" is great. Maybe I need to ask Mr. Tobin himself.

  body: 'Glad you like it! Yes, it''s custom (working title: Faina). I''ve only really
    finished the caps of the condensed medium weight seen above but it''s already
    come in handy on lots of book covers. I''m also working on a wider version where
    the boxy corners get more pronounced. I hope to complete bold versions of both
    condensed and extended fonts (caps only) and interpolate a lot of options from
    there.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/faina-hambur_6007.gif]'
