<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This card is for a seasonal outdoor restaurant. The idea was to present it as a postcard and to be printed on a brown card stock. <br>do you think the 2nd example with "live music...." and "now open" is too much? I want the recipient to see it as a postcard and for its possible use as one. <br>thanks for any comments. <br>david.<center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif align=left alt=application/x-macbinary>front of card<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/card_front-11895.unk target=_blank><b>card front</b></a> (117.0 k)</td></tr></table></center><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif align=left alt=application/x-macbinary>back 1<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/card_back1-11896.unk target=_blank><b>card back1</b></a> (98.4 k)</td></tr></table></center><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif align=left alt=application/x-macbinary>card back 2<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/card_back2-11897.unk target=_blank><b>card back2</b></a> (128.0 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody>Make up your mind about the typefaces! Just Matrix Script and Base are enough, I think. The front of the card is quite minimal compared to the back, and yes, I do think the back is a bit too much. Remember the orange is going to become quite muddy when printed over the brown stock. Do you really think people are going to use it as a postcard?</div>

<div class=commentbody>whenever I hear of someone using multiple Emigre <br>fonts I'm interested to see what sort of mess they've <br>gotten themself into. I agree with Keith, the front is <br>minimal, and I think it works. try to carry your delicate <br>minimalism to the back. <br> <br>I'm confused as to why you felt the need to introduce <br>Base 9 when you already have Akzidenz Grotesk (my <br>first-glance guess) to contrast Matrix Script. again, I <br>agree with Keith; dump Base 9 and play that post-mod <br>italic off of your nice 19th cent grotesk! <br> <br>one more thing, if this is a standard size business card <br>(which it appears to approximate) then I don't think it's <br>viable as a postcard by USPS regs. <br> <br>oh yeah, last thing, where did that second italic come <br>from? dump that one too and use the grotesk in its <br>place.</div>

<div class=commentbody>alright, one more thing. if you're planning on hitting the <br>orange twice, the outcome should be nice. otherwise, <br>keep Keith's advice in mind when designing and <br>presenting to avoid a surprised (read: upset) client.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the front, and although I don't mind the two sides having different moods, I also don't like the back as it stands. Also, on the front I would set the "the" in a smaller size of the "HUDSON BEACH" font, not the script. <br> <br>As for who would use it as a postcard, I think the cafe itself could use it that way effectively; there's something romantic about getting a postcard. As long as it's not from a dentist. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>If that is a standard business card size, you can't mail it in the US. The machines will choke on them and the post office probably would refuse them outright (learned this the hard way with my wedding invites ;o) <br> <br>The days of 'anything with a stamp can be mailed' are long gone. <br> <br>Check with your local post office and get the latest mailing standards booklet from them before attempting to sell the client on the idea of making these as postcards. <br> <br>Also, if it is standard business card size, the important info on the back (phone number/address) seems to be incredibly small. <br> <br>As for colors, there are few paper vendors that produce duplex papers (different colors on each side). Not sure if there is a brown/orange out there, but you may want to look into that (should reduce your printing to one color, so it may save you a few bucks over a double-impression of orange). <br> <br>The logo is great.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks everyone for your input and advice, very much appreciated and i will make some changes. Thanks Darrel, it would be pointless for me to continue the card as a postcard, the restaurant will have the cards on the tables and i thought maybe a few could have stamps already on them, it was an idea. <br>thanks again. <br>david.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I could be wrong (anyone else have any thoughts on this?...), but I'm not sure that your double hit of yellow will be as intense as shown on your comp. The ink is still semi-transparent and will probably darken on that chipboard stock. Maybe you should try opaque white with a dry trap of yellow. Ask your printer.</div>

<div class=commentbody>if its used as a post card that the restaurant is sending out - whereby they are appying the postage....who's gonna see "breakfast, lunch and dinner, weekend brunch" <br> <br>even if left on the tables for customers - its a bit much to suggest (even graphically) that they pay the postage and send back the card...which counteracts the idea of promotion.</div>
