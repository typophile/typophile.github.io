  Albanian alphabet is one of the ancient writing systems of the Caucasus region.
  It is said that is was created by Mesrop who is known to have also invented the
  Armenian alphabet. It was almost forgotten for centuries but rediscovered in the
  20th century, namely on palimpsest manuscripts kept in the St. Catherine\u2019s
  monastery on Mount Sinai.\r\nIn 2007 I had the honour and the pleasure to make the
  inauguration font for the edition of that source. This font was also used for the
  recently launched new Albanian block (10530) of Unicode. The new font now released
  is based on that encoding.\r\n\r\nGo to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_Albanian_alphabet#Rediscovery|Wikipedia]]
  for further reading."

    be perhaps useful ;)

    any settings. It certainly looks like something Mesrop would have made. It might
    even help shed light on the initial renderings of Armenian, before it became Hellenized
    at the hands of scribes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
