  so I used to use this font a lot on MS Paint on Windows XP.\r\n\r\nThrough upgrading
  and such, I lost the font, though I remembered it was termed \"Metro\". Quick searches
  showed me quite a lot of fonts share the name, so I gave up looking.\r\n\r\nHad
  some renewed fervour today, and of all things, found it searching google images
  and coming across it on ufonts.com, where they termed it \"Metro Regular\". Downloading
  it, MS Paint continues to identify it as \"Metro\".\r\n\r\nSo, I guess I've already
  vaguely identified it; I just want to know is there any details behind this font
  that would help me not lose it, considering \"Metro\" is a fairly unhelpful search
  term. Any specification?"

    Later on Peignot's designer hung himself (FYI on the same night that I was born
    - not important :-) because he didn't get enough respect from a certain font house.
    So maybe don't use the illegal clone - buy the real thing.\r\n\r\n* http://atypi.org/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    article in tipoGrafica magazine]] very interesting! (and - ironically- not very
    legible, in this 4-column-PDF format, at least not in my 18.5\" screen)\r\n\r\nI
    suppose I like it so much, because although I had to work from time to time in
    other areas of computing and IT technology (to make a living) my primary interest
    in the last 20 years is machine vision & image pattern recognition. Understanding
    human vision is for me the most valuable source of information to derive new algorithms
    for machine vision.\r\n\r\nI have a lot of questions.... I doubt this is the most
    appropriate thread but I can't give up the temptation to ask one or more questions.\r\nWhat
    is the Mas Lucida project?\r\nis a font:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/maslucida.gif\r\nor
    it is something more, like trying to measure the readability of many experimental
    fonts?\r\n\r\n...and the primary question which popped-up in my mind while reading
    your article is, how easy is to design a font having as primary goal to improve
    readability and at the same time to make the font \"beautiful\", \"elegant\",
    etc - you know all these things that are part-subjective but they have also a
    deep root in archetypes and current aesthetics, and are changing so slowly?\r\nIs
    it possible that our eyes could finally convince our  mind that readable is beautiful?\r\n"

    to follow automatically the columns. The footnote references are also clickable

    worked nice in Safari is causing trouble in Firefox. You now select the hand tool
