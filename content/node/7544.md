  body: U&#43;00D0 is the codepoint for the capital Eth, which usually looks just
    like the capital Dcroat, U&#43;0110 &#40;though the lowercase forms are quite
    different&#41;. In a font which encodes the same glyph to multiple codepoints,
    a single glyph, with either name, might be mapped to both codepoints. <BR> <BR>In
    Adobe&#39;s fonts, we avoid encoding the same glyph to multiple codepoints, just
    to deal with the uncommon situations where one has glyphs but not the original
    text. However, this is not an absolute necessity in font development. <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T
