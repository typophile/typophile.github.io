<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi. I'd very much like to know which font this is but I've been having some difficulty in identifying it. Have found many which somewhat look similar even, but, none yet matched, so I was wondering if anyone here could please help?... Thank you so very much. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25012.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>I would agree with Mike (he posted his before I finished writing mine :-). A lettering artist would not have done an "i" like that. The difference in the lowercase "e"s could just be bad reproduction.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think I could probably make Adobe Palace Script SemiBold fit with a bit more work. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25031.jpg alt=Gyllene> <br>The T has clearly been seriously altered. The whole thing has been converted to curves and lc x-height, baseline shift and squooshing</div>

<div class=commentbody>jack K. davidson: "a lettering artist would not listen to the music of the Swedish band Gyllene Tider either : )" <br> <br>Now I'm blushing... Oh dear... Actually... I was rather hesitant, to post my question here, and for two reasons: 1) because I feel that I'm all too ignorant in the typophily subject to even deserve the right to bring my questions to those in this forum, and 2) because I am a little bit too shy to... well, I'm just a rather shy person... guess I just wasn't prepared for something as jack K. davidson's comment... <br> <br>Anyways, with this I even forgot to say the main: thank you so very much for your replies. Yes, I have actually tried also with Palace Script, yet, indeed the "T" doesn't quite match... Then again, and regarding the 3 "e"s not to be exactly the same, well, that image which I uploaded previously, it is actually made with a dingbat font which reproduces the original logo, and I don't actually know whether the person who created this dingbat font used the original font itself as source, or only the image of the original logo itself, so perhaps this may be why for the slight differences between the 3 "e"s?... <br> <br>All in all, here's the logo in an original picture: <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25039.gif alt> <br> <br>And again, thank you for all your help.

<div class=commentbody>Once more, thank you for the kind help and welcome. :-) Even more as, in some way, it is hard not to feel as too much a "noone" in this field to even think that my questions have a place in this forum... It just feels as if my occasional curiosity is way too irrelevant to be brought to such experts, if you know what I mean?... Then again, and seen as I have had no luck with sharing my questions in other forums on the subject, so that's why I dared to ultimately "step in" to Typophile's... So again, sorry for the much bringing me here being merely the curiosity of mine to finding out about some fonts appearing in some records of mine, I mean, I can't help feeling this being too insignificant at the eyes of you... I mean, I don't even know what lettering is!!... :-P And, as running my eyes through a couple of other threads,the feeling only grew, you know, that feeling like: "Geez... I am so small in what I wish to ask... and they are so big in what they answer... should I... should I at all dare to bother them with my mere curiosity?..." Which leads me to once again say thank you, thank you for the kind welcoming words. :-) And even to maybe then take the opportunity to question about a few other of those fonts in those records which keep having me curious, if I may?... I would have a doubt first, though, as I don't know whether I may/shall go on using this same thread for my further questions, (even more now, after its subject/title having been changed), or if I should actually rather start a new thread for each of the fonts I wish to ask about?... I'd appreciate if you'd please clear me on this. And thank you once more, for all help. :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Again, thank you everyone, for all the kind words. :-) Oh, and as for having not registered from the start, well, that was only because, as I said, my appearence in this forum is most likely to be rather occasional I guess... Well, either way, still, registration is done. :-) <br> <br>And, jack K. davidson, no, no need to say sorry, absolutely, not at all, please! :-) I mean, it wasn't even about your comment in itself, which I fully respect. (Your words only stated an opinion. Something to which every person is entitled to. Or ought to be anyway. Sadly enough our world doesn't always roll in the right direction, but, that's another story of course...) It was more the fact of... well, of someone (in the case, you) recognizing the "source" of the logo I presented... It just felt like, in that moment, the spotlight had turned on, pointing right at me, and saying: "So, you like Gyllene Tider!", if you understand what I mean? :-) And, truth is, I am not that much fond of being in the spotlight really... :-) As I said, actually I'm rather a shy person... discrete... reserved... And although yes, indeed I do follow and enjoy the work of the Swedish music artists Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson, also true is that I keep it as something... well, personal... personal to the point of blushing, when it is noticed, yeah, oh dear, do I feel ashamed... :-) So I guess in the end the blushing did "denounce" me, huh? :-) Yes, you reckon right, caught me there. ;-) Sandra is the name. (Although... a guy is entitled to blush too... isn't he? ;-)) And also to you I thank for all the kindness. But please, please don't say sorry, there's no reason for that. At all! :-) <br> <br>And so now, and if may, I'd then like to request your help on trying to identify another font. Off to start a new thread then. And thank you. :-)</div>
