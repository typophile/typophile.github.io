  body: I would say it all depends upon the client and the market. I would also say
    that if you need general numbers your numbers seem good enough.

  body: Tim, its all about your time. In the late 60s into the late 70s they made
    type with no leading and kerned dog into god &#40;super tight&#41; then came the
    ulta loose revolution double line spacing and loose spacing. I&#39;m seeing a
    swing towards tight spacing again, but, I hope, not tight leading. Its about content
    and not design, I hate to say it but its true.
