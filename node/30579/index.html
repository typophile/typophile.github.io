  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Well I cant get mad, but im very disappointed. . . CS2 SUCKS on the intel based Macs. I work from a dependable g5 desktop and just purchased a new macbook pro laptop. Aside from transferring my activation back and forth every morning before I go to work, CS2 is perhaps the most unstable program I have ever used when running on the Macbook pro. Illustrator crashes every 20 minutes or so, and dont every try to use the pathfinder toolbar. . . bad juju. InDesign crashes on certain saves, and when page counts exceed 50 or so.</p>
<p>I cant live with out these programs, as im sure many of you others out there cant. I would expect a little more support from Adobe for these issues. Some sort of a fix seems almost necessary.</p>
<p>Anyone else having as much trouble as I am?</p>
<p>Is Rosetta a program running behind the scenes on the Macbook Pros that allows the older programs to be compatible (barely) with the newer OS.</p>
<p>Adobe claims CS3 will be ready in Spring and that Leopard could also be a fix. But I have no idea on that release date.</p>
<p>Anyone who can console me would be my hero ;)</p>

<p>Just seems likes theres a gap in the thought/marketing process leaving a lot of people sort of holding their breath for cs3. Ive been editing lots of high quality .raw to .psd or other files in the beta photoshop CS3 and its not only impressive but fast.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I —completely— share your frustration. As an owner of 2 intel Macs, and a heavy user for some time of Adobe programs, it makes me cry every time I see Illustrator CS2 crash because I decided to use the pathfinder. Any program is highly unstable, and when you have a big job / file, it will simply freeze or crash. Even if you aren&rsquo;t doing anything, just letting Photoshop CS2 sit idle, it will crash, sooner or later. It&rsquo;s abysmal.</p>
<p>I am in love with the CS3 beta, but I really, —really— hope they speed the release of the complete Creative Suite 3, which is slated for Spring this year.</p>

<p>I second that. It&rsquo;s easy to blame the third party developers because it seems to be their applications that are causing the problems, when really a lot of blame can go to Apple. Although I&rsquo;m a Mac user, Apple seems to move too quickly without giving their developers enough time to catch up with their changes. The same sort of thing happened when they introduced OS X a few years back. If the keep doing it, it&rsquo;ll bite them in the a$$ eventually.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Wii, Nintendo had a similar problem back in the day when they decided to stick with a cartridge based system instead of compact discs. They lost a lot of their 3rd party developers and went from number one, to now trying to catch up to Sony and Microsoft for market share. A hardware change is a big deal to developers. Apple needs to start paying attention to this because people using Adobe products is major factor driving Mac purchases.</p>

<p>Adobe doesn&rsquo;t fix bugs unless they&rsquo;re security related. If you want bugfixes, you have to buy the next version. Hell, I&rsquo;d probably still be on CS1 if Adobe had ever fixed all the horrible Illustrator bugs.</p>

<p>Though I do not own an Intel-Mac ( yet ) and I am not using Adobe software - apart from the old PhotoShop Elements 2 ( because I need some PhotoShop- only plugins every now and then ) and Acrobat Reader , I think this issue is indeed to blame on Adobe rather than Apple&hellip;
I am a heavy 3d- software user and my main 3d app. - Maxon Cinema 4d - was among the very first applications to have a Universal binary version since January 30, 2006.
Others were soon to follow and even software from very small developers was soon updated - like Graphic Converter to name one.
As - IMHO - 3d software is not less complex than PhotoShop or Illustrator,  I think Adobe played &quot; the tough guy &quot; here and showed they were BIG enough to withstand all this&hellip; Pity. They shouldn' t have left their enormous userbase in the cold &hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The crashyness of the programs I use has varied over the years.
Since OS X, I have generally had fewer crashes and freezes, and the beautiful thing is it&rsquo;s just the program that crashes, not the entire computer. And the program reboots real quick.
So sure, you might lose some work if you haven&rsquo;t been saving (but many programs have auto backup facility). If you know the prog is a bit dodgy, you will be careful with saves.</p>
<p>The worst ever was the version of Quark that crashed when you moved the cursor a little above the menu bar. I had huge horror stories with the introduction of both System 7 and the Power Macs. Getting used to OS X wasn&rsquo;t easy, but it had so many new features which made up for the problems. Apple going Intel has beeen relatively smooth, for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m running CS on an Intel Mac, and it&rsquo;s slower than on the G4 I was using, but streaming content on the Internet is brilliant. I knew CS would be slower, but it was time for a new computer.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t expect Adobe and Apple to sync their product releases, so I don&rsquo;t think there is any blame here. And the upgrades come fairly frequently, so just sit tight for CS3 which will be Intel-native, ennit?</p>
<p>I hope that was some consolation James.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re quite wrong there; just because Cinema 4D has limited functionality that makes it easy to port doesn&rsquo;t mean that the same applies to any other software, note the continued absence of universal binaries for Maya and Lightwave.</p>
<p>Some of the Adobe apps really were to complicated to be compiled with XCode when Apple when to x86, which is the big reason for Adobe not rereleasing CS2 for X86. Adobe lays it all out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>

They also recommended that I hold off buying either or until CS3 had been released. 
I bought it anyways because I needed it for school, but I havn&rsquo;t had many problems. The occasional crash here and there but very inconsitent. The only concrete problem was Bridge taking its sweet time, and Version Cue not working at all. Good thing I only bought the student version.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Guess I&rsquo;m lucky to have only CS, because it works just fine on my Macbook.. in my opinion it&rsquo;s way faster than sinlge-G5. Indesign has crashed couple of times, seems to be mainly because of font related problems (ie. fonts not installed and trying to print). I&rsquo;m not using too much Illustrator, but the Pathfinder works ok.. never crashed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently transferring my CS2 Windows license to OSX.. but I&rsquo;m seriously considering about ever installing it because all these crashing and performance issues I keep reading. :/</p>

Does anyone even use Version Cue? Their documentation sucks. I studied everything I could, and still couldn&rsquo;t figure out what the hell I was supposed to use it for.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have used version cue for a few select projects. . .problem being that if you want to use it you sort of have to change any old file folder organization conventions that you have developed or choose to follow.</p>
<p>The nice thing about it is perhaps being able to restore to a previous file, or keep progressive work files, one after the other. Takes up file space, and I can honestly say I never used it.</p>
<p>It does have some nice editing abilities and grouping. Viewing the whole project file in one folder, through a program, and opening in specific programs with just a click.</p>
<p>Sort of like a polished turd to me. . .</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I use Illustrator daily on my G4 (1.5Ghz) - 90% of my work is created on it. I just went to a store today to order a Macbook Pro, but the price was not very friendly with the options I wanted. Even though I knew there were many problems with CS/CS2 on intel macs, I did not know they were that bad. I guess I&rsquo;ll hang on until CS3 is out then. Please Adobe, make it quick!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can chime in here&hellip; Because of a rapid growth situation in my art department, we&rsquo;ve been forced to purchase several new macs. We&rsquo;ve added intel iMacs, Macbook Pro&rsquo;s, and most recently, a few Mac Pro&rsquo;s. The major kicker with CS2 really seems to be RAM. With the first round of laptops and imacs, we didn&rsquo;t max the RAM out, and can&rsquo;t run illustrator and photoshop both without one crashing the other. Today is my 3rd day of working on a new Mac Pro Quad 2.66, upgraded to 4GB RAM. It&rsquo;s a compltetely different story. Some things seem to be even faster than my dual 2.0 G5 2 GB RAM. The iMac is much better off with a RAM upgrade as well. It also seems like rosetta (no matter the mac) runs best if it&rsquo;s been restarted from time to time. The PS CS3 beta has been too buggy for me to continue with, and i&rsquo;m happy so far with CS2 under rosetta. If you&rsquo;re stuck working with an intel mac at this point&hellip;shove as much RAM as you can in the thing and plug away until &ldquo;second quarter 2007&rdquo;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Iv had a few beers, so you might need to clarify. If I allocate more ram out to Illustrator it wil lwork better? My Mac Book Pro has 2 gigs of ram. Are you talking about allocating ram or upgrading ram?</p>
<p>Bottom line is that my office is a 5 minute drive. I now get to work from home because my g5 tower does a lot better than me taking my mac book pro to the office (damn windows).</p>
<p>On another note did anyone see the Vista previews. . . all of it seems sort of like following behind OSX and its uselss special features. One thing that really stuck out was the live desktop. . . the breifly touched on it (via cnet) and although its just pretty its a nice feature.</p>
<p>Cheers. . . its time to watch Jack Bauer save the world</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You can&rsquo;t allocate RAM to specific applications in OS X, at least not easily and with a deep knowledge of BSD UNIX performance tuning. But there&rsquo;s no need to do so on OS X, in the old Mac OS that was available because the system lacked memory protection so applications tended to stomp on each other&rsquo;s RAM and crash the whole thing.</p>
<p>But running OS X does take a lot of RAM, I honestly can&rsquo;t get much done without being constantly aggravated on less than a gig, for design work I need two gigs. It&rsquo;s especially important with Rosetta; she&rsquo;s a big fat cow of an app and tends to graze her way through pastures of free RAM, leaving massive heaps of crap in her wake.</p>
