  body: I find the Belarus team jersey's use of Benguiat charming, although it's too
    bad they chose to write "Belarus" in Latin.

    \"to beat\".\r\nActually I think it's a space character.\r\n\r\n@Jongseong\r\nDid

  body: I wasn't commenting specifically about Nick's picture but just relaying what
    I had observed about type on another team's hockey jersey. You can probably just
    do an image search for "Belarus hockey jersey" on the web if you're curious.
