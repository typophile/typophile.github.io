  body: "Yes. OTMaster provides direct access to individual TrueType/OpenType tables,
    so it is especially useful for editing aspects of a font once one has progressed
    from a tool like FontLab to the .ttf or .otf as the source format, e.g. when using
    VOLT or VTT.\r\n\r\nIf you run Microsoft's Font Validator test tool on a font
    after VOLT work, you may find some errors reported, including the maxContext field
    of the OS/2 table. These can be corrected using OTMaster."

  body: "John,\r\n\r\nCan you cite a few examples of errors?\r\n\r\nYou are saying
    that the work order is:\r\n1. FontLat to .otf or ..ttf\r\n2. Microsoft's Volt\r\n3.
    Microsoft's Font Validator \r\n4. OTMaster\r\n\r\nCorrect?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I usually run Font Validator iteratively, so that I can step back and fix
    any errors resulting from one tool before proceeding to the next, so:\r\n\r\n1.
    FontLat to .otf or ..ttf\r\n2. Font Validator\r\n3. Microsoft's Volt\r\n4. Microsoft's
    Font Validator\r\n[...possible other tools e.g. VTT for hinting...]\r\n5. OTMaster\r\n\r\nVOLT
    doesn't update the OS/2 table macContext field when it compiles the GSUB and GPOS
    tables. Font Validator will report this as an error and will also calculate the
    correct value; then you can use OTMaster to update the OS/2 table.\r\n\r\nOTMaster
    can also be used to do things like add a format 14 cmap table if you have a font
    with Unicode variant selector codepoints. You can also copy and paste tables between
    fonts using OTMaster; I find this particularly useful if I have added glyphs to
    a font directly in VTT and then need to replace the post table with an updated
    one.\r\n\r\nThe more tools there are in your workflow, the more useful a tool
    like OTMaster becomes."
