<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>hello,
i'm working on a catalog, which will have the german text and the according english translations side by side. i'm currently using «guillemets français» (respectively for german typesetting the »other« way round). for the english translations, however, it even does not seem to be an alternative option to do so.
but before having different looking quotes, i'd like to ask, whether it is allowed by any reason to use these quotes in english texts.
opinions?

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Using guillemets for English text is extremely rare - I've only seen it like twice.
But I think it's also extremely NICE! Please don't give up on it.

<div class=commentbody>Depends on what you mean by "allowed": is it suggested by any English-language style guide in North America? Nope.
I think you might get some direction from looking at classical recording liner notes: as an example, I've pulled out my 1983 (remastered 1997) Teldec recording (0630-18952-2) of Handel's <em>Messiah</em> that has notes in English, French, and German. The French and German quotes use guillemets as you've specified, but the English use " -- the North American ones, not the British.
While I will agree with Hrant that they look nice, you risk confusing your readers if you use them: FWIW, I wouldn't, but YMMV.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I speak fluent French and am fairly comfortable in German, and therefore use the guillemets in both directions as you mentioned above (and in French, use them almost every day).
However, even though I am very fond of those languages and <strong>adore</strong> using the guillemets for their shapes and the strong associations that they carry for me, I agree with Linda.
If you are addressing an audience that is not very familiar with European languages, they will be confused. If you are addressing Europeans, won't they <em>also</em> be confused, because they will be expecting to see the “ ” symbols?
To my eye -- and thinking about how skillful design can support and underscore the language -- it seems perfect to set these things »auf deutsch« and “in English” to give each language its strongest flavor. Oder?

<div class=commentbody>The only context where I would consider doing something like that seriously is if I was making a catalog of french or german stuff for sale and I was seeking to signal the french or german feeling of the good s in the text. And then only if I thought my audience was going to 'get' the joke. Actually if I was doing something maybe an art piece where I wanted to deliberately make the english major type crazy I would be all over the bird's feet then too. Or for a punk-emo-hystrionic CD/album cover.... But yeah, if I was really trying to sell stuff to americans... I wouldn't do it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is really surprising to me. I did desktop publishing for 5 years at a translations company and worked with language producers from both Germany and France, among other countries. We <strong>never</strong> set German quotation marks using guillemets -- we used curly quotes (set in reverse order, of course).
We only used guillemets when typesetting French, never for German <strong>or</strong> English.</div>

<div class=commentbody>During the time (1976-77) that I spent studying with Friedrich Neugebauer, and assisting him on projects, he <em>always</em> used the reverse guillemets. Personal preference, perhaps? A more Austrian usage? Something harkening back to ur-times?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I didn't get into the "allowed" business because the way I think and live that tends to not work out for me. :-) But I was sort of implying that it's so extremely rare because people totally don't expect it. <cite>On the other hand</cite> how much confusion are you really liable to cause? Especially in a bilingual book - not your average boondocks lit. And if there is any confusion, would it last more than half a minute?

I'm all for that, it's just that the English quotes are so lame when
it comes to: spacing; and differentiation with the apostrophe.
> doing something like that seriously
Well one of those places I've seen guillemets used in English is a pretty "serious" work: G Knuttel's "The Letter as a Work of Art", set exquisitely in De Roos Roman.

C'mon, Hrant, there's a time and a place for paddling upstream (and this ain't it!): that you've managed to cite a grand total of <em>one </em>really specialized and/or serious book that uses guillemets in English proves to me that the "rule" is there for a reason, and the breakage thereof is the obvious (and needed) exception.</div>

<div class=commentbody>For a long time the long s was a rule, too. But eventually a few important individuals synchronously decided to ditch it, and made English a little easier to deal with in the process. Don’t even get me started on the various indications of new paragraphs that have come and gone. Who knows, maybe swapping our quotes for guillemets is a shift whose time has come?
Of course, if the clients are not willing to pay for it, the point is moot ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Come on, Linda, that sort of mentality leads to total stasis - you know that.
Sure, you shouldn't try to change a "rule" on a whim, and there are better and worse places to try such a change, but this really seems like a decent place to nudge things in a better direction. For a designer it's almost a cultural responsibility to push the envelope, isn't it? Otherwise it's just another office job.

<div class=commentbody>I'm not saying <em>never</em>, but I just don't see this one going the way of the great auk anytime soon.
There just isn't a plausible rationale for it, for starters. Heaven forfend, I've pushed envelopes all my life, and not-so-long-ago, gave a client a total of 22 choices for using their address in publications. That there were slim rationales for ten of those, and only legitimate (and, I might add, legal postage regulation) choices for two, I merely shrugged when they picked "something else."
(That they couldn't even be bother to be consistent with their choice is what led me to bail out of what you might label as <em>just another office job.</em>) :-)
There's bleeding edge, and then there's just plain dumb -- using guillemets for English is, right here and right now, the latter, IMO.</div>

Well, 99% of readers don't expect a new font, but we still make them.
Really, it's not just what they expect, but what [we think] they need.
> "Attempts to introduce them into North America

I'm curious, where would one see these attempts?
Eben, their lower degree of distraction (after the initial -and I feel short- period of... acostumbration :-) is the main reason I like them! In fact in the case of those quotemets I remember I actually didn't notice them at first - and I'm a font freak!

Sure there is; in fact there are two - which I've mentioned:
1) No confusion with the apostrophe. Think of a plural possessive in quotes, like this: "dogs'". This is especially true for the British practice of using single quotes.
2) Better spacing - fewer distracting and ugly gaps, especially next to punctuation, like a period or comma. You know those funny typesetting rules that say a period or comma should be inside the quotes (even if it doesn't make content sense)? Those rules are in place to reduce crappy spacing. Plus fewer collisions, like after an "f".
I wouldn't suggest changing something simply for novelty.

He doesn't say, Hrant. That's part of the glossary entry for "guillemet," in the back of the book. He goes on to say how they should be used in French, German, etc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>wow, so many posts over night. thank you for all the aspects you are bringing in.
regarding eben sorkin's first post, i should mention, that it is an art catalog, which is actually selling nothing but the artist himself. it's a documentation of a rather weird performance. i added a slight historical touch to the design and that's also a reason, why i intend to use guillemets as quotes. although it is less common, it is an option, when setting text in german language (i guess, it is rather unsuitable for scientific texts or other highly official stuff).
in spite of hrant encouraging the use of guillemets in english language, i see, that for most english speaking people it seems so unfamiliar, that they will point fingers at me ("don't you know, you mustn't use these quotes!"). and, well, using hybrid quotes in the height of the minuscules would easily be even more confusing, wouldn't it? i guess, i stick to the official quotes, though, i might change my mind, if there showed up more "references" for the usage of guillemets in english literature.

<div class=commentbody>Since it is for an artist ( not selling chairs ) then I suddenly think you might have grounds for using them - depending on if they related to what the artists' work is about & depending on if you want the text to be integrated with the work in some way or if you want it to be transparent/supportive/subordonate etc. Does that make sense to you?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think it also depends what the "art" is -- I've got a great T-shirt from a boutique press on Saltspring Island that has their name made up using alt and accented letters: I'd expect to see guillemets used on it!
But if it's not specifically/hardcore type-related, I highly doubt the intended audience would "get it"....
It's also a nice, and rather subtle, way of indicating which text to read, particularly if you're using one font for all three languages.
Make things easy for the audience, and they'll be more likely to buy the art. ;-) Friend of mine teaches a class in marketing for artists, and I know that's one of his mantras....</div>

That's a good point. A great, sad example of how language
differentiation can be totally shot is Emil Ruder's book.

<div class=commentbody>there is a text part, which includes preface, summary and explanation of the work, interview and the english translation of the script (dialogs).
the original german dialogs are directly integrated into the image part, which has a collage-like look. quotes appear rarely in the script, but a few are in there. so it is basically the real text part, which, for instance, sometimes features extracts from the script.

<div class=commentbody>Beacause the quotes will appear intermittently and are not integral to what your doing I think that the choice to use the feet won't look all that deliberate.

<div class=commentbody>Of all the gazillion of lines of type I've designed / set, I've only used guillemets with English once. It MADE the piece. I just wish I had a tear sheet of it.
Maybe this is one of the two things Hrant has seen. Circa 1990; cannot recall the product name, but I do know it was an ad for a shampoo made by a midwestern company. The main feature of the ad was a sultry dame on a bar stool, all legs, smirk, and hairdo. The art director had succeeeded [by some lights] in giving her a "European" look, but we struggled with the type for days.
Finally, switching to Friz Quadrata, I set a version with guillemets around her sassy words. I saw the success immediately, but we did play around with the direction of the guillemets, pointing them in different directions in different versions. This, of course, did not matter; it was a short ad in English, and the assumption was that readers would not care about these matters, but would recongize the asserted European-ness of the product, and then be aware that their sex lives would be remarkably enhanced if they scrubbed with this stuff.
I did have to instruct several levels of art directors, creative directors, and client managers just what the hell those funny marks were, though.
That's one instance where this can work. Otherwise, I'm with the cautious ones -- in general.

<div class=commentbody>If it's only going to be you doing it on one job then it's probably not a good idea. Readers will be confused.
However, guillemets do look better and rules are made to be broken. If you can recruit some other designers — like people here — form a group, issue a press release about why you're doing it and then all of you do it on all your design jobs from now on it might become a major shift in design style.

<div class=commentbody>I think outward-pointing guillemets are esthetically and communicatively the best kind of quotes:
(1) As so many of you have said, guillemets beat the so-called inverted/raised commas because they leave no ugly gaps. Hrant’s point about avoiding confusion with the apostrophe may be communicatively even more important.
(2) For maximum clarity, opening and closing quotes should point in a different direction. It may seem odd that I mention this, but in Finnish composition we have this unfortunate convention – it may come from Sweden – of all the quotes pointing right (i.e. either »this way» or ”this”).
(3) The outward direction looks better, the quotes – especially when they are guillemets – enclosing the quoted matter in the same way as parentheses.
I don’t think things like this should be considered part of the language per se. They have little to do with the grammatical system; they are arbitrary conventions (though certainly part of the literary tradition and culture of each country).
Having said all this, would I have the guts to use guillemets in English text? Probably not. I considered it when doing my own thesis (in English), but ended up using the traditional forms.

<div class=commentbody>George, brilliant idea. I would certainly be a signatory to such a thing, and would love to even write a paragraph or two in its promulgation. Not being an actual font <cite>user</cite> however :-) I wouldn't try to carry the torch myself here even though I'm so vocally supportive of the idea. So if a real font user starts it, I'll jump in.
> opening and closing quotes should point in a different direction.
Agreed. On the other hand I'm no fan of the ductally imposed vertical flipping of the opening/closing quotes. What I call "rationalist" quotes (some others call it mirrored) such as used by Licko and Carter (the latter mostly in his screen fonts) are generally superior in my mind. And there are in fact long-standing historical precedents, for those who need that sort of thing: the French curiosity I showed in that other thread; and much of what ATF produced* around a century ago.
* Probably motivated by the pantograph.

Gee, I was hoping a bunch of folks would jump in here and support this. I imagined this would be the beginning of a sea change in punctuation. Guess not.
Which made me think of:
In the 1930s Jack Northrop developed a flying wing aircraft, the YB-35, which morphed into the YB-49 that first flew in 1948. Turned out no one could fly the thing due to it's instability. There were several crashes and the program was canceled. When the Air Force developed the B2 Stealth Bomber which was based in part on Northrop's work he was invited to see the B2 fly. His idea was sound, it just took time for the technology and thinking to catch up to Northrop. Incidentally the wing span of the B2 matches the YB-49. He was that right about it.
So I have my fingers crossed on the guillemets. Alex may be a harbinger.

Well, eventually.
The Canadian government developed an incredible fighter plane in the late 1950s that blew everything else away, and the Avro Arrow was not only cancelled, but virtually every part or model was dismantled, destroyed, and the engineers were threatened, all because the U.S. government wasn't keen about someone else having a better plane than the F-series.
There is, BTW, a documented set of plans and a prototype of that engine was later used to power the Concorde, but I don't expect my government to roll Arrows off an assembly line any time soon.</div>

Who was it who said the only causes worth fighting for were lost ones? So lets all get together and start building Arrows. There's gotta be a market in the private sector. Know any rich folks who want to invest?
And arrows look like guillemets don't they? Or two flying wings in formation. Or. . .

<div class=commentbody>I'm game to use them sometime soon in English, especially if it's a text that exists <em>only</em> in English so there's no confusion.
And by the way, here's a long-standing use of these shapes.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/citroen-logo_4598.gif]
In the first years of the twentieth century, André Citroën started out with a company that made gears with herringbone-patterned teeth. My simplistic understanding is that these gears will not lose/waste as much energy as teeth with simple horizontal teeth, but require greater precision in manufacturing and alignment. Once he got into the business of making cars he retained the shapes of his gear teeth as a symbol for the Citroën car business. As you can see, though, a realistic representation of the parallel gear teeth was supplanted by guillemets.</div>

Hrant, I hate to be such a killjoy, but in keeping with my comments about this sort of thing not really being part of the language, I would generally prefer each publication to use just one type of quotes, even if it has several languages (whether as parallel texts or more freely mixed).

however, i don't understand, why he used the wrong direction of the guillemets for german typesetting. but maybe <cite>this</cite> is, what could be confusing for readers, rather than heaving this or that type of quotes consequently. they can easily read both texts with a view and then get wondering about, why they point in two different directions, respectively why they are different at all. in this case, i would have preferred inward pointing guillemets for both languages. at least, the german part would be correct then.

That's like saying an architect should (edit: <strong>not</strong>) think about the end use of or the process of constructing a building, but only what "looks" good. And people wonder why so many new buildings are crap. :-(
It's the first and foremost responsibility of both the editor and the publication designer to make sure that the document can be accessed easily by the intended audience, not just to "look" good.
But if the appearance is what is most important, then you've got "art," and not much else....</div>

<div class=commentbody>Why do you equate "works best" with "looks good"? Olli (and others) seem
to essentially be talking about not being too restricted by Das Rules, and to
instead shoot for the heart of Good Design.

<div class=commentbody>Exactly, Hrant! I wouldn't want to go just with what looks good. But it is true that in the real world, functionality has to do with what the readership is used to. The same old problem with typographic reform.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jumping in late... to paraphrase Kenny Rogers, pick your battles.
For an art catalog I think there can be *some* leeway in favor of design over convention. Especially since who buys art books for the text? But you may confuse or slightly put off the english readers. We are definitely not used to seeing guillemets in text. Do you really want to draw attention to them, or is it more important that the text read seamlessly? That IMHO is what you should be focusing on, not what may or may not look better. Remember those of us who are accustomed to quote marks not only don't think they look bad but we don't even really "see" them.
I keep coming across fiction writers who have done away with quotes altogether in dialogue and I find that much more alienating than foreign punctuation.</div>

But if you believe that bad things happen during immersive reading but our consciousness is shielded from them then this "truth" becomes less pertinent. In fact to me this goes hand-in-hand with the conviction that we still/always need more text fonts: it's not just what you <cite>think</cite> you're reading.
Plus in the conscious realm there's still the apostrophe confusion issue.

<div class=commentbody>I wonder how much more smoothly this conversation would go if we were all in the same room, sipping coffee or tea (or <em>obstler</em>) together . . .
Even though I am a card-carrying adorer of guillemets, I have to back up Linda's latest observations. It seems to me that we must carry out our responsibilities to the content first, and then practice «art» as a secondary responsibility. Certainly a gold-plated curmudgeon and conservative person in many ways, Stanley Morison said something like, «It is the duty of the typographer to carry out the intentions of the author without distraction along the way.» (I paraphrase, obviously.)
Communication -- in which we are all engaged as designers -- must get the ideas and feelings across without confusion. If this can be accomplished successfully, then everything else is up for grabs.
I don't think Linda is saying Adhere to This Rule or We Will Tar and Feather You -- I think she's observing that conventions are necessary and expected, such as the placement and clarity of navigation on web pages, or where street signs ought to go, or where the horn button is on a steering wheel.
There was a calligrapher in New England whose work I saw over the years, and she really wanted to be a painter. Her lettering became more and more abstract, until it was just pure gesture, and yet the words were still there (but illegible). Perhaps I, too, am a gold-plated curmudgeon and conservative, but I felt teased and frustrated by this. I wanted her to use pure color and line at this point, or to leave enough clarity so that if she intended me to read the words, I could still do that. Otherwise she is reading aloud a poem in the forest when no one else is present. Oder?
Maybe what we are tossing back and forth cannot be fit into simple rules, and must be interpreted by each designer and client on a case-by-case basis. Certainly for Alex's catalog (not knowing the style of the furniture, the style of his design, the intended audience, the amount of material to be quoted, the <em>nature</em> of the material to be quoted, or the client's preferences!) my instinct would be to use »auf deutsch« and “in English” so that each language has its own differentiations.
If the whole job were in one language, I would be happy to experiment with setting everything in «this style» in any western language, as long as the client felt it would be okay. In the case of a bilingual catalog, having »auf deutsch« and »in English« might be more stylistically unified, but I would think it less clear linguistically, especially if the readers of English were not Europeans. If they <em>are</em> Europeans, then it is much less of an issue. So many factors, and we all know so little about the job . . .
Are we just talking in circles about whether red cars are better than silver cars? Probably. </div>

<div class=commentbody>So I reiterate my question, is this the appropriate place to shake them out of their habits or not? As the designer, that's the decision he has to make. Using guillemets in English text will take the reader's attention away from the text, however briefly. Alex has to weigh the relative importance of design integrity (altho that's certainly subjective) and the integrity of the text, for the reader - and author. Hrant actually said the same thing earlier in the thread I think.</div>

the problem for me is basically, that i really want to use the guillemets for the german text. if i cannot use them for the english texts, the people (with the money) in vienna would be confused at first. i don't think, that the artist has a problem with it. seriously, the guillemets are really the smallest of all problems, that i'm going to face in the next three weeks. anyway, so far i've been getting very usefull opinions from the "typographic society" on this great board.
<cite>not knowing the style of the furniture, the style of his design, the intended audience</cite>
the style is slightly historical (early 19th century) with a unorthodox quirky twist by mixing serif (didone style) and sans serif letters in the headlines. correctness is not the main objective – some textblocks will even "totter" in the text part, column and trim lines will be hand- or respectively mouse-drawn. oh, and the image part will have some really chaotic moments.
but aside from the general design, i'd like to know about what i'm doing, when it comes to typographic issues like the guillemets. and if people (like you, first and foremost) ask me, why i chose to use this or that style of quotes, i might point out, that i didn't do it by accident.

<div class=commentbody>Perhaps it would not seem so problematic if typographers in general weren't so conservative in their choice of text typeface.
As Eric says, people adjust to the idiosyncracies of text type and keep right on reading.
After all, there's no great consternation (amongst the general population) about the use of hash marks in place of curly quotes, so if *we* can foist that abomination on them, guillemets shouldn't be a problem.
Those who would require most convincing are editors.

<div class=commentbody>Now that I read Alex's design brief, I say absolutely use the guillemets everywhere! I was imagining something much more restrained and lower in energy. Do I understand you correctly that you are intermixing Didot and sans characters within the same lines/words? If so, then heavens why are we worried about which way the guillemets point and in which language?! Can you post a PDF of this once you get it all put together? Sounds really interesting.</div>

for all the great help, that i've been getting here, i should really do that. although, i guess, this would need an own thread, regarding the fact, we are discussing guillemets only here – well, i'll prepare for a virtual stoning. ;)
btw, hello nick. you know a little bit about the project, we discussed 19th century typesetting in january. months have passed now. there were some hang-ups, too, because the clients (primarily the backers from vienna) hesitated to give green lights for more than a month.
but now, the printing deadline is near and a nasty bunch of work is still left to do. i was struggling about discussing the choice of type here. but this would have become an endless debate. i've picked my favorite (with all consequences)**. the combination is somewhat odd and it might not be perfect at all, but there's something whispering: "don't dismiss me" ;)
// alex
** <strong>edit:</strong> but maybe ... well, nick, i've spottet a typeface, called <cite>Figgins</cite> in your punchcut article. This looks very promising, though, i presume, it's a custom type, that you did for a certain purpose, isn't it? i have never dared to ask you and anyway, it seems not to be available for sale or unfinished. but just for the case, that it is available, i would have been really eager to test it.</div>
