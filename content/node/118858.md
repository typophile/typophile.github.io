  body: "Edited:\r\nAs Mike says, Element by Max Bittrof, 1933 for Bauer. Here is
    a full character set of the original [img:sites/default/files/old-images/1934-Element-schmalhalbfettX3_6158.jpg]
    The other fonts suggested are similar but not the same. They are all part of early
    1930s attempts to produce no frills versions of Fraktur and bridge the gap between
    blackletter and Roman letters. \r\nThe style was despised by some as \"Jackboot
    Blackletter,\" which is the usual translation of \"Schaftstiefel Grotesk,\"  a
    political condemnation of the style by German socialists  in the 1930s. \r\nAlso
    see a short note on these issues at http://www.100types.com/100types.com.91element.html\r\nThe
    digital Element by Gerhard Helzel appears to be a reasonably accurate interpretation.
    Your sample seems to be the schmallfett weight.\r\nThe fett weight of Element
    has also been digitized as Chistmas http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/newfonts/christmas/
    \ but the quality is inferior to the versions made by Gerhard Helzel.\r\nPhotolettering
    did versions under the name Seidelburg [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SeidelburgPhotolettering_5071.jpg]
    The font was sometimes used for alpine resorts in North America. It was also used
    as the model for signage at U.S. camps used to intern Japanese \"enemy aliens\"
    during WWII. Some of the camps were in the mountains, but it would be difficult
    to call them alpine resorts.\r\nDon"
