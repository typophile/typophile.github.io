    file and then relaunching Quark?

  body: "From the Quark forums:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you launch QuarkXPress, some conflicting
    components may prevent the application from loading properly. The XPress Preferences
    file, fonts, XTensions, printer descriptions or other supporting files may be
    damaged or incompatible.\r\n\r\nSolution: Rebuild a new set of Preferences in
    the local QuarkXPress folder. To do so:\r\n\r\nFor Mac OS 10.3.x - 10.5.x:\r\n1.
    \      If the application crashes, Force Quit out of QuarkXPress.\r\n\r\n2.       On
    the Finder level, go to the Hard Drive > Applications > QuarkXPress folder.\r\n\r\n3.
    \      Inside the QuarkXPress folder, create a new folder by going to File > New
    Folder\r\n\r\n4.       Label the new folder Preferences (use an upper case P -
    It is important that \u201CPreferences\u201D be spelled correctly).\r\n\r\n5.
    \      Launch QuarkXPress from the QuarkXPress folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso check here:\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.quark.com/t/20831.aspx"
