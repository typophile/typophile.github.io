body: "Hi guys,\r\nI came across this site after long hours searching online for typography
  help.\r\n\r\nI have many questions, to begin with here's a little something about
  myself.\r\nI'm a young web designer. I've been on the field for about six months
  so I'm still learning everything that heads towards me.\r\nAbout two weeks ago I
  got my evaluation at work. I got some really good feedback on the type of work I
  do.\r\nMy boss mention I should improve myself in typography. At first I was really
  shock to hear I needed improvement on the area where I thought I had it under control
  or at least thought I knew enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess I'm completely clueless about
  typography. \r\nRight now I have no idea how to start, what book to read or what
  classes should I take..etc.\r\n\r\nMy question is:\r\nWhere is the starting line
  to typography?\r\n\r\nMore like baby steps for me right now. I really love my job.
  The only concerned is my lack of typography and I don't want this to effect my job.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance. \r\n\r\n-KG "

    actually a book called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Type-Typography-Phil-Baines/dp/0823055280/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-4581592-5638319?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186416060&sr=8-1\">Type
    & Typography</a> by Phil Baines and Andrew Haslam that works as a pretty good
    introduction, but I'm not sure if it's been reviewed on Typophile yet. Otherwise
    Bringhurst's <cite>Elements</cite> is a decent way in.  "

  body: "In design school they started us off with... \r\n\r\nThe Elements of Typographic
    Style by Robert Bringhurst\r\n\r\nAnd it scared the crap out of all of us, definetly
    not what I would call a begginer book, definetly an intermediate (once you get
    the basics down) book though, and re-reading it since college has really been
    great.\r\n\r\nI would actually suggest...\r\n\r\nThinking with Type: A Critical
    Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students by Ellen Lupton\r\n\r\nIts a
    fantastic begginer book, and I think the more contemporary refrences and samples
    she shows will help you relate alot better than bringhurst's more \"classic/elite/typesetting\"
    approach."

    is another good one.
