body: The <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/">new iPod photo</a> site says something
  about using a special screen optimised Myriad. Does anyone know any more about this?
  Any sreenshots?

    But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good choice for a mobile device. <BR> <BR>hhp

    target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/autosyncmusic.html</a> <BR> <BR>but
    the pixel dimensions don&#39;t match the spec. Let&#39;s hope the type on the
    device renders better - unless the orientation of the RGB stripes is in the &#39;wrong&#39;
    direction I don&#39;t see why Apple won&#39;t be using their ClearType clone.

  body: Perhaps Apple will be dropping Lucida and going 100% Myriad in future products
    - it would makes sense to tie branding font and UI font in this way. Additional
    evidence in the Wiki... <BR> <BR><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_typography#Apple_Myriad"
    target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_typography#Apple_Myriad</a>  <BR>
    <BR>&#34;Apple changed the name of their licensed version of the typeface when
    they had the format of the fonts converted to TrueType for their internal use.&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>Why convert to TrueType if you&#39;re only using the fonts in print and Photoshop&#39;d
    graphics? <BR> <BR>Si

    <BR> <BR>Apple lost on the side of system fonts, from far compared to the wonderful
    job do MS. After the fabulous Mac 7 and GX and the bunch of new creative fonts,
    nothing appeared. Sound S Jobs who have some qualities on many aspects don&#39;t
    SEE the value of a font.  <BR>Glad that the MS type group is active and do right
    things :-&#41;

  body: In the ipodlounge photos, the small font is Espy Sans, the font currently
    used in the iPod mini and the larger bolder font is the venerable Chicago, which
    like David I was way jazzed to see on the original iPod though I admit, being
    an eWorld user for a time that I was equally excited to see Espy Sans on the mini.
