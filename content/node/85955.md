body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/birdy_590_263_4799.gif]\r\nBirdy was especially
  created during the [[http://www.graphicdesignwalk.com|Graphic Design Walk]] as part
  of the London Design Festival.The event was organised by the team of [[http://www.graphicbirdwatching.com|GraphicBirdWatching]]
  who invited TypeTogether to participate. Veronika was drawing live this new typeface,
  Birdy, conceived there and then. A projector allowed visitors to follow her drawing
  letters and gave opportunity to ask questions directly about the design process.
  Birdy is now available for free to download. The character set is limited to upper-
  and lowercase a some basic punctuation. An extension is in progress. [[http://www.type-together.com/index.php|Keep
  in touch]] for updates.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.type-together.com/graphicdesignwalk|<strong>Download

    of BirdWatching. \r\n\r\nAre there any more details as to why this particular
    broken letter type form? Any relevance to actual birds? \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Hmm... a somewhat interesting take on blackletter. Still, maybe some Norwegian
    newspaper will redo its masthead with it.
