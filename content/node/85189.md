  body: "Generally speaking, you can always use uniXXXX format name in preference
    to one of the Adobe Glyph List names: they will both map correctly in Acrobat
    name parsing. So, for instance, either /uni00A0/ or /nbspace/ is fine. Unless
    otherwise noted below, this applies to the glyphs you ask about, e.g. S/s with
    cedilla.\r\n\r\n/NULL/ is officially correct, as only /.notdef/ should begin with
    a dot, but in practice it doesn't seem to make any difference.\r\n\r\nUnicode,
    following earlier encodings, conflated the spacing macron and the APL overbar
    characters. Designwise, I tend to treat this as a macron.\r\n\r\nU+02C9 is properly
    a high tone modifier sign, and may have different vertical alignment than the
    macron; it is a character that really only makes sense in the context of some
    phonetic transcription systems. I don't know why Microsoft started encoding it
    in their Latin 1 fonts. It doesn't do any harm, but if you are making a font that
    actually supports phonetic transcription you may want two glyphs, one for /macron/
    and one for /uni02C9/\r\n\r\nThe Greek Delta/increment sign is a tricky one, because
    different software handles them differently, so it is safest to create two glyphs,
    name them independently, e.g. /Delta/ and /uni2206/, but ensure that they are
    identical.\r\n\r\n/Idotaccent/ is the Adobe Glyph List preferred name. There is
    no /idotaccent/ character to which such a name would map. Turkish, which distinguishes
    \u0130/i from I/\u0131, requires special case mapping rules.\r\n\r\nI now recommend
    including both T/t with cedilla and with commaaccent, and using the uniXXXX format
    names to ensure they are distinguished. The reason for this is that although the
    T/t with cedilla does not correctly occur in any orthography, when software uses
    the old Romanian encoding and does not apply locale specific glyph shaping, users
    prefer both the S/s and T/t to display with the same incorrect cedilla mark than
    for one to display with the cedilla and the other with commaaccent.\r\n\r\n/dcroat/
    is preferred.\r\n\r\nre. the ligatures. If you want a name-parsed ligature glyph
    to map back to the underlying letters, then use the _ convention; this is generally
    the best solution if a font contains only one set of ligature glyphs. If you use
    e.g. /fi/ that will map to the alphabetic presentation form character, rather
    than to the underlying letters.\r\n\r\nSince the only major software that cares
    about glyph naming conventions is Acrobat, my recommendation is to examine what
    <em>recent</em> Adobe fonts are doing, and follow that approach. Note, however,
    that Adobe try to provide one-to-one mappings, so include duplicate glyphs for
    e.g. smallcaps that map to caps -- e.g. /A.c2sc/ -- and smallcaps that map to
    lowercase -- e.g. a.smcp."
