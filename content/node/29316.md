body: "I've been using Fontographer 4.1.5 NFPU, in Classic mode under MacOS X and
  since I don't presently have the cash to upgrade, I'm trying out <a href=\"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/\">FontForge</a>
  as an affordable alternative for a more modern font development tool. So far it
  is similar enough to Fontographer that I'm not having a great deal of trouble, and
  I'm liking some of the added features. I have yet to delve into anything really
  advanced.\r\n\r\nThere are still some little things that are hampering my transition.
  In Fontographer, you can set up vertical and horizontal \"snap-to\" lines on the
  guide layer. As far as I can tell I can only draw points and curves just as on the
  other two drawing layers in FontForge, and \"snap to curves\" does not appear to
  be an available option. Fontographer also lets you import a text file of words into
  the metrics window, and whether FontForge allows this is not obvious.\r\n\r\nI think
  I've figured out the workaround for getting similar results to \"Auto curvature\"
  and \"Retract BCPs\" which involves going to the \"point info\" dialog -- more precise
  but cumbersome. Are there any other features in Fontographer that are missing in
  FontForge that I should be aware of, and what if any ways are there to work around
  them?"

  body: "OK, Simon. I'll do what I can. \r\nMostly I can only report on my experience
    with FontForge (FF) in relation to Fontographer (Fog). FontForge has many advanced
    features which are both lacking in Fontographer and going over my head presently.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, I've found FF does indeed snap to curves, but only to curves on the
    Guides layer, and they don't seem quite as sticky as those in Fog. I still can't
    pull the horizontal and vertical guide rules the way one can in Fog, but at least
    point locations of drawn guide  lines can be precisely set using the \"Element>Get
    info...\" dialog.\r\n\r\n\"Element>Get Info...\" and right-click on point>Get
    info... both open the Point Info dialog. Why that's not under the \"Point\" menu
    I don't know. You can set the point type and the coordinate location of the Bezier
    points, including the control points either by angle and distance or coordinate
    location. By resetting the \"Default\" check boxes you achieve something similar
    to Fog's Auto Curvature function, but it behaves slightly differently and I have
    not yet figured out just how. There is also an \"interpollate\" checkbox which
    seems to move the point along the curve without changing the curve, but it might
    actually be doing something else that just appears that way.\r\n\r\nOne notably
    lacking feature of FF is that there is no \"Duplicate\" or \"Clone\" function.
    Various forms of Copy and Paste are offered, but no one-step replication."

  body: I've been using FontForge for a while now for very light-weight kinds of things,
    and I've had a good experience with it.  However, I'd be very interested to hear
    the opinions of someone who plans to use it in a more serious way.  In addition
    to the mailing list given above, let me just add that the creater of FontForge
    seems to still be very active.  If you find a bug and report it to the devel mailing
    list, it's likely to be addressed.
