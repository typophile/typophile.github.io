  on Dwiggins.  I&#39;ve been collecting his books and writings for years. I&#39;ve
  occasionally thought about putting together an article or small book, since I&#39;m

  body: <i>&#34;The Linotype digitization of Electra will &#42;not&#42;, unfortunately,
    yield results anything like the original.&#34;</i> <BR> <BR>I suppose my comment
    is relative to one&#39;s familiarity with Electra and one&#39;s pickiness. Anyone
    who knows me will tell you that I&#39;m picky. <BR> <BR>For education purposes,
    I have prepared a small comparison of the two versions. The first image is from
    the debut of Electra, <i>Emblems and Electra,</i> published by Mergenthaler in
    1935. At this stage, the face was completed in twelve point only and had not yet
    been graded &#40;i.e., adapted and cut for other sizes&#41;. The second is a facsimile
    that I produced using the digital Electra LH, printed at 1200 dpi on toned paper
    to match the value of the Lino sample. Both were then scanned and the background
    normalized. My sample, although produced from a laser printer, is a fair representation
    of what the digital type looks like when printed in today&#39;s books. <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7342.gif" alt="Electra Lino sample">
    <BR>Linotype metal <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7343.gif"
    alt="Electra Digital sample"> <BR>Digital <BR> <BR>Certainly some of the difference
    in the overall color is due to the difference in printing technology. That is
    unavoidable. Even so, the digital Electra makes a very different texture on the
    page. It has a higher stroke contrast than the Lino and the fit is a little wider.
    Many of the letters are visibly wider in the digital version -- look closely at
    the &#39;h, n, m.&#39; Observe also that the &#39;o&#39; and &#39;e&#39; in the
    digital are noticeably rounder, the &#39;a&#39; is more squat. The biggest difference
    in character shape occurs in the &#39;t.&#39; The original has a substantial tail
    which adds a great swing to the line, while the digital &#39;t&#39; is precariously
    balanced on a shy bottom.  <BR> <BR>The differences are, I admit, subtle. But
    on the page, they accrue to create a result which is, in my opinion, palpably
    different from the original. <BR> <BR>I strongly suspect that the digital version
    was patterned after the 10 point Electra font. If so, this would explain the slightly
    wider character proportions and the looser fit. The original cutting, and by far
    the most useful size for books, was twelve point. &#40;The samples are set 12
    on 16.&#41; I don&#39;t know why the 10 point would have been chosen as a model
    for the digitization of this quintessential book face. <BR> <BR>The sentence in
    the middle of this sample reads, &#34;Make a line of letters so full of energy
    that it can&#39;t wait to get to the end of the measure.&#34; The original Electra
    does this admirably. The letters march in step and fuse wonderfully into rich
    word shapes. Take a look at a word like &#39;something&#39; or &#39;what.&#39;
    The digital, by comparison, falls a little short of the mark, in my opinion. <BR>
    <BR>My frame of reference is as a book designer. Electra was arguably the most
    popular and most widely used text face during the heyday of American book publishing
    in the 40s and 50s. While I would happily use Linotype Electra for just about
    every book &#40;if only I could&#41;, I will not specify the digital version.
    It just doesn&#39;t do the job. I am always disappointed when I see it used in
    books today because it is such a pallid ghost of its predecessor. Perhaps if I
    wasn&#39;t so familiar with the original I wouldn&#39;t feel so strongly. <BR>

    is looser in the digital, but you can see that both are fitted about right <i>for

    may, indeed, be some  <BR>sort of contemporary taste. There are undoubtedly  <BR>some
    who prefer the digital version to the original.  <BR>Who can account for taste?
    <BR> <BR>My primary point was that digital Electra is a thing unto  <BR>itself
    and not quite like the original -- so those who see  <BR>Electra being used in
    books from the 40s and 50s and  <BR>observe that it is a &#34;killer font&#34;
    may be disappointed  <BR>when they license the digital font and attempt to get  <BR>the

    or that it shouldn&#39;t be used, necessarily.  <BR>But I personally don&#39;t
    think it does Dwiggins&#39;s design  <BR>justice.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps someone from
    Linotype monitors these  <BR>forums. If Linotype are interested in continuing
    their  <BR>program of reworking standards -- like they did with  <BR>Frutiger,
    Optima, Sabon, et al. -- then they might give  <BR>consideration to an &#34;Electra

    <BR>Undoubtedly the weight comes in part from the ink  <BR>gain. But this amount
    of gain was standard for the time  <BR>and Dwiggins did design with this in mind.
    Most of the  <BR>progressive proofs that Lino made were printed on  <BR>several

    think the quality of letterpress does contribute to the  <BR>charm and vigor of
    the great types of that era. And  <BR>some of that has definitely been lost in
    the transition to  <BR>digital and offset. I don&#39;t necessarily think, however,  <BR>that
    we should strive to &#42;mimic&#42; that softness in our  <BR>own technology.
    But neither do I think we should  <BR>ignore these factors when transcribing metal
    designs to  <BR>digital. I think there is something valuable to re-learn  <BR>by
    looking back at metal types; but then we must move  <BR>forward. <BR> <BR>We can
    only speculate how Dwiggins would feel about  <BR>the digital technology of today.
    I know that Dwiggins  <BR>expressed several times his desire to get sharp, crisp  <BR>type
    and images. He was a progressive thinker. I&#39;m  <BR>sure he would have embraced
    the possibilities. But I  <BR>don&#39;t think he would have approved of the brittleness  <BR>and

    I&#39;m not sure this is the whole reason. Granted, there are idiosyncracies and
    imperfections introduced by the machine and the process. But, first of all, this
    specimen was produced by Mergenthaler and, presumably, they would have produced
    their specimens to the highest possible standard -- in the setting, at least,
    if not the printing impression.  <BR> <BR>Secondly, the alignment in the letterpress
    sample is not substantially different from progressive proofs that I have with
    Dwiggins&#39;s annotations on them. The dropped &#39;t&#39;, for instance, and
    the extreme bottom overshoot of the &#39;s&#39; and &#39;w&#39; -- these are present
    in the proofs. There is even evidence of the &#39;t&#39; in some of the original
    10x12 ink drawings. Surely if Dwiggins disapproved of these features, he could
    have had them recut and recast. The machining process was quite precise and the
    tolerances quite small. Instead, I maintain that, for better or for worse, these
    things were intended by the designer. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Another thing that has

    to the Linotype Library GmbH catalog, Electra was digitized in 1994. American
    Linotype was dissolved by then, I&#39;m pretty sure; and while the assets went
    to Germany, the original drawings and brass patterns went to the Smithsonian &#40;some
    materials have since been distributed elsewhere&#41;. I&#39;m fairly certain that
    Electra was converted to photofilm, so it is quite possible that the digitizations
    were made from film masters. I can try to check up on this. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;My
    feeling is that WAD might well have approved of the digital version that everyone
    is now convinced is a trevesty compared to the metal orig. </i> <BR> <BR>Obviously,
    I disagree. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do not think that Dwiggins would have been
    adamant about mimicking the letterpress look -- quite the opposite, he would have
    been interested in progress. And if he&#39;d been involved in any conversion process,
    I don&#39;t doubt that he would have taken the opportunity to make improvements
    based on experience gained since his first text design. But from everything I&#39;ve
    learned so far in my research about his process and his tastes -- which types
    he approved of and which he didn&#39;t -- I don&#39;t think he would have been
    satisfied by the letters produced by the current digital version. <BR> <BR>--

  body: I think Kent&#39;s revelation about Dwiggin&#39;s proofs shows that, contrary
    to Gerald, most of the variation was deliberately designed. I have a 1962 book
    set in Electra, and the &#39;t&#39; dipped below the baseline is there, although
    less pronounced than in Kent&#39;s sample. <BR> <BR>Also Gerald&#39;s view &#40;if
    I understand it rightly&#41; that you shouldn&#39;t take into account the ink
    spread of classics in doing revivals, I don&#39;t think holds up. If Dwiggins
    took it into account, why shouldn&#39;t someone digitizing Electra try to reproduce
    the effect of the printed version rather than the original matrices? It is also
    inconceivable to me that Caslon or Baskerville weren&#39;t also taking it into
    account. <BR> <BR>The classic standard for beauty is &#34;unity, variety, and
    balance&#34;. It seems to me that the option of being incredibly precise with
    digital type &amp; photo offset printing may have tempted designers of text type
    to make the typeface too uniform. I suspect this affects not only beauty of words,
    but also readability.

  body: '&#62; This machine is a friggin line caster. <BR> <BR>Good point, although
    they could still have digitized from the lead. But I agree that&#39;s unlikely
    &#40;and your phototype idea makes the most sense&#42;&#41;. BTW, how could you
    digitize from matrices? <BR> <BR>&#42; Although of course the question simply
    becomes where <i>that</i> came from... <BR> <BR>&#62; The classic standard for
    beauty <BR> <BR>No such thing, my friend! <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>BTW, I once bought
    an issue of The Colophon &#40;New Series, V3#2, Spring &#39;38&#41; simply because
    it used the original Electra &#40;with the Italic, not the Cursive&#41;, and although
    &#34;lone&#34; settings of the Italic do look ungainly, I think it works very
    well for emphasis. Which makes sense considering the impetus behind the slanted-roman
    idea. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'Regarding ink spread: <BR>I think it is poor design to try to slavishly mimic
    the precise <i>effects</i> of ink spread in digital revivals of metal type, because
    one has to reckon that some aspects of that spread are beyond the control of the
    original type designer or punchcutter, reflecting the particular ink composition,
    presssure, paper surface, etc. employed in a particular printing. On the other
    hand, reference to letterpress printed sources is absolutely necessary to get
    a sense of the desirable weight of the type &#40;for this purpose, multiple examples
    are better than single sources, but best of all are examples printed by or under
    the supervision of the original type designer&#41;. So the particular pattern
    of ink spread, e.g. at junctions, is not necessarily something to be revived,
    but the overall impact of ink <i>gain</i> on stems, bowls and hairlines is.'
