body: "Hey guys,\r\nHere is something I've been working on. This is my first sketch
  and I could use any help. \r\n\r\nCONCEPT\r\nI wanted to create an elegant face
  based on the very curvy physique of swans. For inspiration, I am refering to Baskerville
  and the occasional Bodoni.\r\n\r\nLINK (its in flash so you can zoom in)\r\nhttp://prakashnair.com/secret/hamsa/hamsa.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPrakash."

  body: "Almost all of the letters looked like they had been cut off right at their
    baseline and x-height. Is that your intention? That could also be due to low resolution.
    Care to give us a PDF of higher resolution?\r\n\r\nAlso, the <em>s</em> look rather
    imbalanced and the stroke on the upper part of <em>f</em> need to be thinned --
    like Rotis' c, it is in danger of falling over, albeit much less so. But I dig
    the <em>g</em> :)\r\n\r\nAny possibility of using the face at text size? It looked
    robust enough to me."

  body: "Great font!\r\n\r\nIt definitely has a lot of curvy enegry to it. I am a
    beginner, so take my comments with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nThe upper curve of
    the 'a' may be a bit too heavy shouldered. The 'g' has a lot of character. Its
    lower ear may be a bit too heavy and its upper right section looks a bit too rectangular.
    What about starting the curve of the 'f'-hook a bit lower in its stem. Now it
    seems a bit abrupt. \r\n\r\nHope this makes sense.\r\n\r\nSebastian"
