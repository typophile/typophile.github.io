  body: "It's a custom logo. The script portion was designed in 1957, with the swash
    \"C\", and has undergone numerous tweaking. Prior to that \"Cardinals\" was spelled
    out in non-connecting letters.\r\n\r\nYou might find something similar enough
    for you at Mike Yanega's Script font ID guide:\r\n\r\n    http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html\r\n\r\nDon't
    think there's anything close enough here, but take a look:\r\n\r\n    http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/sports_script/\r\n\r\n
