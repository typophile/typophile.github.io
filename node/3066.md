  body: 'Back in the day, there was a magazine called Factsheet Five that served as
    a reviewer/chronicler/informal clearinghouse for hundreds of zines. It was founded
    by Mike Gunderloy and ran for several years before foundering in the 90s after
    a couple of changes in owner/editorship. &#40;The publication&#39;s ghost site
