  body: "They came from a compagny, Grafityp \"leaders in lettersystems\"  who went
    broke in 1996.  I used the program \"AGS-Design\" where they've been used for
    inscriptions on tombstones.    In 2008, I changed to another program but can't
    find those fonts to import.  I still need those for additional inscriptions.  All
    I can do at the moment is to import them as \"seperate drawings\" & place them
    at the right place.  \r\n "
