  all--\r\n\r\nI was unable to attach an image for some reason, so I've provided a
  link to the sample text. \r\n\r\nAny help in identifying this font would be greatly
  appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nChris\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think this could also be another old metal type, very similar to Hellenic
    Wide, that has some odd vertical stress. CSA made a digital version called <a

  body: "I greatly appreciate the help. I think I can live with either. \r\n\r\nIt
    seems that the Hellenic Wide face is a bit bolder than the sample, but, again,
    neither is bad. \r\n\r\nFeel free to close up shop. \r\n\r\nAnd, again, thanks,
    folks!\r\n\r\nChris\r\n"
