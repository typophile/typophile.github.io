  logo ?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.designworklife.com/ (quite similar...)\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your help.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to do my logo with a font base that is similar to the
  Marshall logo, so I'm looking for fonts (similar) that could help building my logo.\r\n\r\n\r\nOr
  maybe for a good begining base this font could be great, but I don't know what is
  this font ?\r\n\r\nWords: secretarial and ribbon\r\n\r\nhttp://media2.smashingmagazine.com/images/retro-vintage-typography/curt.jpg\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nthe
  font here for \"Country Style\" could be great, too...\r\n\r\nhttp://ffffound.com/image/6158ff5bfd0b813da8bbd041b52f2b76af005b53\r\n\r\n"
