body: '[New to graphic design] I really like serifed fonts for, of course, their legibility.
  I also like Trade Gothic as a label typeface for its simplicity. I&#39;ve been pairing
  it with Perpetua, because I have it, but it seems very obvious, very vanilla. If
  I were going to invest in some new pairings for Trade Gothic, what would you recommend?
  Why? &#40;i use Perpetua because it seems like a standard pairing, and it seems--to
  my untrained eye--like some of their strokes compliment one another&#41;. Thanks!'

    primary question is about legibility. '

  body: ' <BR>Michael, why do you think Perpetua is &#34;vanilla&#34;? Don&#39;t you
    find Minion to be more &#34;vanilla&#34; than Perpetua? I think Bembo and Minion
    are vanilla, and have to say that Perpetua is at least a good milk chocolate.
    ;&#41; Are you looking for something with chunks of dark chocolate? Try Storm&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/tyfa.html" target="_blank">Tyfa</a> or watch
    for Font Bureau&#39;s <a href="http://orangeitalic.com/fonts/farnham.shtml" target="_blank">Farnham</a>
    ... well, I think they are nice and full of rich dark chocolate.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    agree that for reading purposes Perpetua isn&#39;t the most legible. But, vanilla?
    I&#39;d say vanilla should be equated with safety, and therefore Times Roman is
    the most safe. Hehehehe. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>If you are looking for a text face, but
    don&#39;t want boring or blah, take a look at Font Bureau&#39;s <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10765190622478102&amp;fontname=Whitman"
    target="_blank">Whitman</a> ... I&#39;d say Whitman can be used for some display
    work too ... or <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10765190622478102&amp;fontname=Miller"

  body: Pairing Trade Gothic with Electra works very well. I used it in the redesign
    of Publishers Weekly magazine several years ago. <BR> <BR>Both are American and
    both are American Linotype.

    of the pairing &#40;in my experience&#41;. But let&#39;s forget about the cliched,
    unclear metaphor: instead of continuing with what I know works, I&#39;d like to
