  I find 5 files. One is the \u201CFont Suitcase\u201D and the icon bears the letters
  FFIL. The 4 other files are \u201CPostscript Type 1\u201D and the icons bear the
  letters LWFN.\r\nMy questions are:\r\n<ul>What do FFIL and LWFN stand for?</ul>\r\n<ul>Is
  the \u201CFont Suitcase\u201D a bitmap font?</ul>\r\nTo rephrase the previous question:\r\n<ul>What's
  the FFIL file for and what does it do?</ul>\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nSeb"

    I still wonder what the letters LWFN and FFIL mean though!"

  body: Forget about Next. These are Mac file types that predate OS X. They are always
    four characters. In older Mac OS's you never saw them unless you used a developer
    tool. LWFN is the file type of a PostScript outline font. FFIL is the file type
    for a font suitcase. Too bad they decided to use such generic looking icons. What
    was wrong with a picture of a suitcase?

  body: "Thanks Mark, that's very clear. I agree with you about the generic icons.
    However, since I am new in graphic design I am not familiar with the suitcase
    metaphor and therefore it doesn't help me understand what's in it. So, this lead
    me to ask you the obvious\u2014why a suitcase?"

    an interesting theory. You have to remember, though, that the people who came
    up with these things were not printing industry people, they were programmers.
    For nearly a year, the only device commercially available that could output PostScript
    fonts was Apple's LaserWriter. PostScript fonts were commonly called LaserWriter
    fonts for a while. When the Linotronic and other devices came out, the usage faded,
    but even the Linotronic was accessed via the <em>LaserWriter</em> driver for years
    after, even when the LaserWriter was discontinued. Note also that Apple's icon
    for a PostScript font was a picture of a LaserWriter printer."

    23.0) was the only PostScript printer in existence.\r\n\r\nLWFN is an Apple name
    for LaserWriter [outline] FoNt.\r\n\r\nThe screen fonts, which were bitmaps, were
    in separate font \"suitcases\".\r\n\r\nThe outline fonts were in Type 1 format,
    with each face appearing separately.\r\n\r\nTimes Roman had four outline files.
    Others had eight or more."
