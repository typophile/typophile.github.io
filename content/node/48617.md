body: "Lost & Found Stock will be a collection of old photos in black & white, some
  of them hundred years old. Most of them though, there are no information as to where
  they are from, who shot the picture, and the people on it. It' part of the charm
  and mystic.\r\n\r\nI wanted to pick a type that was not elegant, but maybe trying
  too, or just an old weary elegance. The logo could be an acronym, so Lost & Found
  Stock could be typesetted \"L&F stock\".\r\n\r\nI've attached two examples. I have
  fine-tuned anything, these are just too give a good idea of what I was thinking.
  I'm looking for any advice, tips or critiques, and I'm specifically looking for
  alternative ampersands for the script-logo, because I don't like the current one.\r\n\r\nThe
  typefaces used are Paperback (serif) and Dear Sarah (script), and H&FJ's Historical
  FellType (alternative ampersand)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    in using a font, in case other things/word would be set in the same typeface.."

  body: "I like how you are starting with the L&F mark. I think it could use a little
    tightening of the space between the L and F. \"Stock\" should be smaller so it
    properly aligns with L&F or  it should expand beyond (and not just a smidge, enough
    so it looks intentional) on both sides. Personally I lean toward having it align
    but play with the design. \r\n\r\nSet ampersands in every font you own and see
    which appeal to you. Look at samples from foundries, and practice drawing your
    own - you will strike upon an idea that inspires you and then develop it more.\r\n\r\nYou
    need to determine the name. Will it be Lost & Found Stock, or L&F Stock? Do you
    want to be able to use both - if so you need to work on both now. Your Dear Sarah
    samples are an ok start but using Dear Sarah for your L&F design might not work
    so well.\r\n\r\nWith the name Lost & Found it might be interesting to have your
    logotype look like it was put together by mixed pieces. By that I mean different
    typefaces. It's a great name for a stock collection. Maybe you should try old
    wood block letters or something that has a corrosive rubber stamp feel.\r\n\r\nKeep
    working at it, would like to see more postings."

  body: "Thanks for commenting Kirsten! Why do you like the third one best? I'm a
    bit nervous that the third will end up too fuzzy n small sizes (seing as it has
    three rings instead of two in the first, and one in the second). But on the other
    hand, I find the second frame slightly boring as well. Maybe that's a good thing
    though with all the ornaments in the type.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the
    tiny one? Is it too small and unreadable? Does the ampersand look a beer label
    when being filled with white?"

  body: "To be honest, i really don't like it.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the concept,
    theres far too much going on (too busy) and the ampersand is a blurry mess at
    small sizes (in all the versions). There is zero chance i would ever give my credit
    card info to a company branded like this as i would be worried about some 17 year
    old kid running off with my bank details.\r\n\r\nIs it supposed to be Victorian?
    Because i don't get that at all. Its kind of country and western, reminds me of
    a belt buckle i bought in Nashville. Did you think about paul's idea? I really
    feel that has a lot of potential. i guess i'm just confused, i just don't understand
    what its trying to convey, what its supposed to mean.\r\n\r\nOh, and the colour
    (or lack thereof) needs more thought - too bland, imagine it on a an A4 cream/white
    letterhead....yikes!"

  body: "Actually David, you were the one that introduced the concept 'Victorian',
    not me. I agree with most of what you said, but maybe you're judging the logo
    development too heavily under your search for \"good old victorian photos for
    a current\".\r\n\r\nWhen you mention belt & buckle from Nashville, you're actually
    not spot on for some of the photos in the collection! It's a diverse body of photos,
    most of them having a sense of melancholy, humour & nostalgia in them \u2013 in
    my mind.\r\n\r\nI leaned towards a script type because I wanted to associate with
    the signatures people have put on their old photos from time to time (and which
    the collection preserved in the digital form). Also, the obvious historical and
    nostalgic aspect of it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, people seemed to presume I was the
    \ creator of the collection, but this is not the case.\r\n\r\nAgreeing with David,
    my biggest problem seems to be the fuzziness at small sizes. I guess this is a
    general problem with script-type, so I'm a bit uncertain what to do. Could you
    perhaps explain more in detail why you like the signage-approach? I tried to make
    a logo with rubber stamps, but couldn't use the technique properly, I might need
    some practise. Maybe later again.."

  body: I'd try a much thicker script that might look like the metal logo on an old
    camera. I think something a bit more substantial-looking would help give the impression
    of a large collection. I really like the collage idea too, especially if you could
    make it from letters in images from the photo collection.

    so much the signage designs but more the undertone of nostalgia and humour that
    comes from the typeface, especially if you still want to do the initials. Would
    be interesting to combine with the drop shadow technique illustrated in Paul's

    time you posted it, but didn't notice the type specimen and all the little cool
    \"and\" & \"vs.\"-style symbols.\r\n\r\nI actually thought about doing an \"and\"
    with two ornaments instead of an ampersand, it just didn't seem to work in small
    sizes. I think this is where the photo collage idea fails as well: it won't communicate
    the photos in small sizes. Unfortunately, the logo will appear mostly in this
    size - on a website. Too bad, because there are so many cool approaches to this
    logo, just that they take up some space to be justified.."

  body: "Malte, I still like your last posting. The ampersand was going to need an
    alternate solution to work at the smaller sizes though. To me your latest design
    said elegant and by-gone era. However, after reading more descriptions of the
    photo collection that direction may not be the most suitable. The formal script
    is sophisticated, but not at all like the actual writing you would find on someone's
    old family photographs. I do very much like David's suggestion of using Brothers,
    a definite cool vintage feel. You are right, there are so many directions to go
    in. Look at the collection, what adjectives would you use to describe it? nostalgic?
    quirky? vintage? elegant? Victorian? retro? funky? moody? off beat? whatever that
    essence is try to incorporate it into your design.  The palette is subtle (some
    say boring) but I thought it was appropriate for the subject - old photographs
    - black, white, gray, sepia, beige. Looking forward to your next post.\r\n\r\n"
