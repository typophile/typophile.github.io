  body: Nice! Especially love the g with its huge ear and the k. Your output rate
    astounds me. How long did this one take you?

  body: Thanks, and happy to hear that you liked this one; it had been brewing in
    me for a while. This took me about two weeks, and most of last week was making
    the kerning pairs.
