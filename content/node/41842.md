  New Century Schoolbook. I realize it\u2019s kind of a trite face by now, ubiquitous
  as it is on so many computers, but there's also a comfort in its familiarity. And
  its open, generous character width makes for readability, I think, that might make
  training materials easier on the eyes.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest anything\u2014perhaps
  nothing exotic\u2014that has a similar degree of ease on the eyes and reability,
  but that isn\u2019t overused?\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: Everything I find on Sassoon shows it as a sans serif. I was definitely thinking
    a serif face. The only sans serif I'm inclined to try for a whole book of text
    would be Optima.
