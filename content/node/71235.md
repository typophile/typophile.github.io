  just worked on a project in mandarin and, although the project is finished, am still
  looking into it.\r\n\r\nI had some problems embedding Mac OSX fonts into PDF so
  I looked around a lot and found several complaints concerning the Heiti fonts (SC
  and TC) that are now standard in OS 10.6. This link is the best example http://fixhei.monoceroi.com.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have an opinion on this? I can't read a word (or ideogram) in chinese so
  I really don't see the flaws. I am concerned that the font may be flawed and am
  trying to find out if it is safe to use it in text meant for chinese readers.\r\n\r\nYour
  input will be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGabriel Attuy"

  body: "lol, \"black body!\"\r\n\r\nAnyway, there are some very noticeable differences
    in the example you posted. But first, let me clarify that I am NOT a native Chinese
    speaker. Nor am I anywhere near fluent.\r\n\r\nIn the second link you posted:\r\n\r\n-
    The stroke width consistency seems improved (look at the bottom of \"zhe,\" \u9019
    the third character from the left). \r\n- Also, the top stroke of the speech radical
    \u8A00 now stands upright (left hand side of the first character, also seen in
    the third character).\r\n- The bottom radical of zero \u96F6 (I forget what this
    radical is called) also has a more modern form.\r\n- The radical \u793A now takes
    on a different form when inside a character (see the left hand side of the second
    character). \r\n- The silk radical \u7CF8 is now also different when positioned
    in the left of a character (see the seventh character). \r\n- The food radical
    \u98DF is also different (see the sixth character).\r\n- If you look at the feather
    radical \u7FBD, it is more modern.\r\n\r\nThere other differences as well. I'm
    fairly certain that any person fluent in Chinese will be able to read either version,
    but if they're picky the second version is probably better. I find it more aesthetically
    pleasing, in any case.\r\n\r\nI think the most offensive problem is that there
    seem to be inconsistent radicals. Chinese characters are made up of \"Radicals,\"
    which are smaller components. Some radicals have different ways of being written,
    and some of them change when they become part of another character, as opposed
    to standing alone. Some radicals have changed shape in the past few decades.\r\n\r\n
    If you look at \u8ACB, \u60C5, \u6E05, \u5568, and \u6674, the right half of these
    should all be the same. If you look at the lower-right hand side, its different
    from character to character in the previous version. The first link you provided
    highlights this (and other problems) nicely. \r\n\r\nAlso, note that a lot of
    these are only for traditional characters; I'm not sure what changes would have
    been made to the simplified character set. Many of the problems wouldn't apply
    (for example, the bottom three strokes of the silk radical become a single line:
    \u7E9F)"

  body: "What is being discussed are what can be best described as Pan-Chinese fonts
    that were introduced in Mac OS X 10.6. They are Pan-Chinese because they are TTC
    (TrueType Collection) fonts that advertise two font instances, one for Simplified
    Chinese, and a second for Traditional Chinese. The same fonts, though with Japanese
    and Korean fonts instances, are included with the iPhone, and those are Pan-CJK
    fonts.\r\n\r\nThese two STHeiti fonts, Light and Medium, stem from two similarly-named
    Simplified Chinese fonts. The glyphs for the Simplified Chinese font instances
    follow GB 18030, which is effectively the URO and Extension A in terms of the
    ideographs. There are also 6,000 or so glyphs for Extension B code points, mainly
    for Hong Kong SCS coverage.\r\n\r\nI know the source of the glyphs, and I also
    know many of the issues surrounding the design and development of Pan-CJK fonts.
    One design issue that affects any Pan-CJK (or Pan-Chinese) font implementation
    is how to handle the locale-specific glyphs code points that do not have a source
    for that locale, meaning that the ideograph is not used. There are two choices.
    One is to simply not design a glyph for that locale, meaning that if used, the
    design may be inappropriate for that locale. The other choice is to design a glyph
    for that locale, and depending on whether there is an adequate source or reference
    for that ideograph for that locale, the designer may need to extrapolate.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, I consider the ST Heiti typeface design to be first and foremost a Simplified
    Chinese one. The Traditional Chinese glyphs needed to be designed. Of the 30K
    or so CJK Unified Ideograph code points that are covered, approximately one-third
    have forms that are specific to Traditional Chinese.\r\n\r\nI could go on and
    on..."
