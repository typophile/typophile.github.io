  body: "What is this from, and how old is it? Judging from the image it seems to
    all be artwork (i.e., hand-drawn).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for taking a look Mike. I was told it was the logo from a gaming site.
    My client really likes the type style... the \"drawn\" look is because they printed
    it on an ink jet printer that was low on ink and I bumped up the curves in P.S.
    because the original was very faint. \r\n\r\nSo you think it was hand drawn? That
    was my fear... anyone know of a font that has a similar \"K\" to this design?\r\n\r\nAs
    before thank you to all who take a look!!!\r\n\r\n"
