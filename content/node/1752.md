  forums because I&#39;m interested in hearing a wide range of opinions on this .
  . . <BR> <BR>Lately it seems I&#39;ve been getting a good amount of e-mail from
  customers asking if there is an additional royalty for using our fonts for: books,
  websites, posters, use on products. <BR> <BR>Are there that many foundries out there
  that have a license for every instance of font usage that they charge for? I&#39;m
  familiar with embedding licenses, broadcast licenses, embedded devices, but I&#39;ve
  never heard of restrictions on usage I would expect the font would be used for in
  general anyhow. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s just an odd trend I&#39;ve noticed and wondered
  if perhaps this is commom practice among other foundries or perhaps if this speaks
  to an upswing in customers awareness of aquiring appropriate licensing. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
  love to hear everyone&#39;s opinions on this . . <BR> <BR>Stuart :D'

    which monitors broadcast performances for composers and publishers. They they
    could charge royalties like for song performances.  <BR> <BR>This would mean the
    &#39;ASCAP&#39; like organization would check published works for fonts. Given
    the weak protection for type designs, at least in the US, this seems unlikely
    to ever happen. '

  body: Perhaps my post wasn&#39;t clear. . . I&#39;m not proposing anything whatsoever.
    I&#39;m making a query to determine if other foundries require these levels of
    additional licensing because I notice more of my customers coming to me to find
    out if additional licensing is required. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

    Perhaps you&#39;re getting calls from &#39;art buyers&#39;  <BR>who are new to
    font licensing? &#40;I&#39;m just speculating.&#41;

  body: There are a variety of different licensing agreements used in &#40;stock&#41;
    photography, and the fee will vary based on the kind of usage. <BR> <BR>There
    is one kind of fee stipulation used by some stockco&#39;s, relating to using an
    image, unmodified, as the single image and &#34;reason to buy&#34;, in instances
    such as a book cover, or on a mug. This is what may have given your customers
    the idea that if they use a typographic image, for instance a single character,
    as a primary graphic, this requires extra licensing. <BR> <BR>With fonts, different
    foundries have slightly different licence arrangements, but it&#39;s all about
    restrictions, and not about graduated fees. <BR> <BR>I did have one customer ask
    me if it was OK to use a single, unmodified character from one of my typefaces
    &#40;Morphica &#34;D&#34;&#41;, as a logo -- and then trademark it. Without consulting
    my lawyer, I said it was OK. In retrospect, probably not the right thing to say.
    I hope his client doesn&#39;t sue me for continuing to sell the font. <BR> <BR>

  body: Stuart - offhand, I think Chank and House both require additional <BR>licensing
    for commercial usage. I&#39;m guessing some others have seen this fine print <BR>and
    have followed suit. <BR> <BR>bj
