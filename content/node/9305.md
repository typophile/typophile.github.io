  body: 'Oooh great, a comment! Thanks, Paul. It took me days to figure out how to
    make the GIF, but I&#39;ll try this PDF thing as well. Why? Will it be clearer?
    My purpose: I&#39;m a novelist &#40;The Book of Flying&#41;, and concocted this
    kooky idea that my books should be in my own private font. This was three years
    ago. Since then I&#39;ve learned lots about fonts, and about how bad I am at making
    them, and about how addictive it is. This is about my fortieth attempt; I learn
    a bit with each design. I want a clean, pretty, readable font. I&#39;ve looked
    hard at Palatino, Bembo, Baskerville, Galliard among others. Keith'

  body: 'Yes, a PDF will be quite a bit clearer: you can magnify it without blurring.
    <BR> <BR>I think having your own private font for your books is a great reason
    to make new fonts, and this one looks like a nice start at a clear, readable,
    but distinctive font. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have much to say about the shapes &#40;maybe
    the lower serif of lc and cap S is a bit light&#41;, but the spacing definitely
    needs work. I recommend this <a href="http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_20.pdf">tutorial</a>
    as a start. <BR> <BR>The serifs look like Novarese &#40;or maybe Fenice, another
    of his&#41;. I can see the Galliard influence strongly in the in the caps. Go
    for it!'

    work.  <BR> <BR>In addition to a PDF, maybe we can see a sample text, so as to
    address the relationships between letters? Thanks, and congratulations, it sounds
    like a long time coming. <BR> <BR>aaron

  body: Yeah, it substitutes to adobe Serif... what program are you using to generate
    the PDF? Also, is embedding allowed in your font? Make certain that it is, then
    configure your virtual printer &#40;Distiller or, if on linux probably GS&#41;
    to embed non-system fonts. It works on your machine because the font is installed
    on your system

    used that program&#41;. Any other suggestions? Keith

  body: Are you planning on using this for extended reading? From the gif above it
    looks high contrast for a text face. The thin and thick strokes of the lowercase
    especially. Maybe it will look different at smaller sizes. Definitely in print,
    but that&#39;s asking a little much, I suppose ;&#41;

- author:
    name: keith_miller
  body: The thick/thin contrast is commensurate with other reading typefaces such
    as Bembo and Palatino, so I think it should be all right. Thanks for the comment,
    though. Wish I could make a PDF so you could see it more clearly. Keith

  body: Do you have Acrobat or any of the other Adobe products that can output PDF
    &#40;InDesign, Photoshop&#41;? How about some other PDF creation program &#40;CutePDF,
    etc.&#41;? If the answer is no to all of those, try to <a href="https://createpdf.adobe.com/index.pl/2332494874.76552?BP=NS6&amp;v=AHP">create
    a PDF online</a> at the Adobe website. I believe Word is one of the supported

  body: 'It&#39;s a very renaissance author that does his own fonts. What a cool idea.
    I&#39;d be interested to read some of your work, and compare your literary voice
    to the voice of the type.  <BR> <BR>As you get further along in your project I
    would recommend you print out some samples, head down to the book store and compare
    it to some books that you admire. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s hard to give specific feedback
    from the GIF, but a few things that jump out: <BR> <BR>The terminals on a,f need
    some thought. They feel light, and maybe too sharp. I&#39;m not convinced that
    the monumental M and N are appropriate for book type. Maybe on a marble pillar,
    but not in body copy. Maybe I&#39;m just all Trajaned out. The terminal on your
    y could use a good scrubbing too. <BR> <BR>Isaac is right about the stroke contrast.
    Most of the computer types out there are optically tuned for about 12 point, which
    is huge in book text land. This puts their optical size right between display
    and text. <a href="http://studio.adobe.com/us/type/main.jsp?xhtml=topics/opticalsize">Here</a>
    [adobe.com] is a good piece on optical sizes. As you get smaller, the dimensions
    and weight of your characters should change. Your characters look like they are
    tuned for display sizes. <BR> <BR>As for spacing, you will find that it will do
    as much to influence the look of your types on the page as the details of the
    characters. Just like you&#39;ve referenced different types determine the character
    shapes, the easiest way to learn spacing is to look at existing faces.'

  body: 'Thanks very much for the comments. The terminals of the a and f are indeed
    worrying, particularly the f for some reason. I find Zapf&#39;s solution for Palatino
    too cramped, though it works visually, but the swoop of the renaissance humanist
    fs are unsettling. I&#39;m trying for something in between, with a broken counter
    space that echoes the lower loop of the g, but it still lacks grace. Too stiff
    and upright. I&#39;ll keep working on it. The reason for the triangular terminals:
    I&#39;m trying to create a sort of tinkly harmony among all the serifs - this
    may be more clear in a PDF. It may also be unsuccessful. The font was indeed created
    using 12 point as a basis. Hadn&#39;t thought that smaller sizes would need a
    different contrast. Thanks for that comment, Christian; I&#39;ll read up on it.
    I think the spacing does need work - should be slightly broader. Now, can one
    be Trajaned out? I find that typeface spectacular, can&#39;t look enough at it.
    I&#39;m stealing some of its lettershapes because they fit the clean vibe I&#39;m
    going for. Keith'
