body: I've made this font and I don't know what to do with it so I thought I'd stick
  it on a website with some samples and a pricetag and see what happens. I'm trying
  to make the samples interesting but I'm not much of a designer. Any suggestions?

    I do love the idiosyncrasies. Check the overall color. What point sizes was it
    designed for ?

  body: "<strong>Dan</strong>, I started a thread asking for feedback on the font
    itself months ago. Since that has pretty much died down and my persistent question
    \"what do I do with the damn thing after thousands of hours of work?\" remains
    unanswered, prompting me to try to strike out on my own and offer it (and two
    others) through a website. However, thinking that a sample of the font would help
    to sell it I thought perhaps I ought to seek some feedback on my attempted sample.
    Of course, I'm not certain I'll ever get around to actually making the face available
    but as long as I learn something new it isn't a wasted experience. You'll find
    the original thread <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/8799\" title=\"critique
    for n!samual *formerly NSFbook*\">here</a> I'll crosspost in that thread, too,
    I guess.\r\n\r\n<strong>Eric</strong> Originally I was thinking 9 to 11 points
    but I like the way it looks as high as 42. Of course the contrast between the
    outer curves and the inner angles throws a lot of people and I've had mixed reactions
    to its use in titles and headlines."

  body: I only asked on the type size, because I could see a variation of this as
    a titling style, but the you'd have to figure out how to de-weird it at higher
    point sizes, while making it feel like it's still in the same family.

    dictionary/thesaurus, magazine. Just think of the different ways you think it
    can be used. You can pace the pages with variety of sizes and maybe throw in a
    few of the tried and tested ways, such as those which Font Bureau uses.

  body: I was thinking some more about possible typographical uses for the various
    fonts I've made and of course advertising is a fairly obvious one. The only emotional
    appeal I remember from the one course I took many moons ago was sex appeal. Sex
    appeal to sell a font? It sounds  dubious to me, too. Nonetheless I mocked-up
    three ideas in the form of mini-posters. Like I've said before, I know very little
    about design but I do know when something can be better. These can definitely
    be better. I'm just not certain how to do that. So here are<a href="http://www.grodworks.com/temp/idea0.pdf"

    And here is <a href="http://www.grodworks.com/temp/idea1webview.pdf" title="Frimbo

    version is a 32mb download and can be found <a href="http://www.grodworks.com/temp/idea1.pdf"

    encouragement, and constructive derision are all solicited by this posting.

  body: "I think the minimum you should show is a character set and some body setting
    in various sizes (if applicable for the font). The n!samual setting is working
    better but you need to pay careful attention to the setting to get it as polished
    as possible for the Cervante's text I would start the copy in the counter of the
    e and avoid situations like you have at the bottom where \"the\" hangs out and
    the rest of the line is justified with rivers appearing while page 2 is not working
    at all try having the copy in two columns. The 4 looks modern compared to the
    rest of the numerals, the gy lig is out of style and the currency symbols need
    attention. For the book setting it is probably best to follow a conventional layout,
    justified type, running heads horizontally in the top margin, etc. The sex sells
    angle is not working, I think you should show more of the (type)face and find
    a less obvious image, the people you are trying to appeal to are visually aware
    and might dismiss the mini-poster before considering the type design.\r\nTim"

  body: "<strong>Timd</strong>, thank you for the feedback. I think you've raised
    several valid points. The only one I outright disagree with being p2, the text
    there is not intended to be read as text -- although one can do so if one wishes
    -- the point size and the tint were both chosen to be difficult to read as text.
    In other words the small print is there as a visual element to serve as a ground
    for the three sentences in black and to create the white space of the lc -g-.
    I think you are spot on regarding p3.\r\n\r\nI have to reluctantly agree with
    you on the mini-posters. I'd hoped that visually aware people would get the humor,
    but either it isn't funny or it's too subtle. Most likely the former. Let me explain
    my thinking. \r\n\r\nThe copy in the first of the two Kisbefe posters reads \"Kisbefe,
    classic beauty with a sense of fun.\" Classic = classical = antiquity = Greco-Roman.
    Ever notice how the majority of statues that have survived to the present day
    have done so <em>sans</em> limbs and head? And neither limbs nor head are visible
    in the photo? And Kisbefe is a sans-serif? Well, I thought it was clever, guess
    I was wrong. \r\n\r\nThe second Kisbefe poster reads \"Elegant / Daring / Colorful
    / (the font, not the model).\" Why, because elegant can (well, it will with a
    bit more photoshop) describe the model. Daring, note her right nipple is pierced,
    daring but not outrageously so, and colorful note the tattoo. Ideally these thoughts
    would run through the viewers mind concurrently and then they reach the parenthetical
    and are asked to look more closely at the medium that communicated the thoughts
    to them -- the font. It should all happen too fast to register that it is happening,
    hence the three word description. I guess that one falls flat, too. \r\n\r\nFinally,
    we have Frimbo. This one is far more direct. The photo would work in an Abercrombie
    \ ad if the model were wearing jeans, nothing unusual there. But the text, \"Classic
    <em>Beauty</em> / Contemporary <em>Style</em> -- he's got it all: Meet: <strong>Frimbo</strong>
    (the font, not the model)\" anticipates a similar mental process as the second
    Kisbefe poster and tweaks the readers nose just a tiny bit. Classic Beauty, fine,
    no problem, Michelangelo's David, the Olympics, the ideal of male beauty is familiar
    to everyone. But who thinks about living breathing men as beautiful? OK, so women
    might, but more common is \"handsome,\" \"stunning,\" \"gorgeous,\" \"a hunk,\"
    and the highest praise \"Grodesque\" and \"like a Grod.\" So we have a model who
    loosely (hey, free stock shot by amateurs, when I get my camera fixed I'll shoot
    something better) conforms to the classic ideal but isn't made of stone. And here
    is why it could be funny. Take a straight white male insecure in his identity
    bombarded daily with images of young, virile, stallions and confronted each morning
    in the mirror with once muscular abdomen going to pudge and a distracting glare
    from his head. He reads \"classic beauty\" and looks at the picture and starts
    to feel uncomfortable on a level that he isn't aware of. By the time he gets to
    \"(the font, not the model)\" he feels relief and mistakes it for amusement. Meanwhile,
    a woman reading this might appreciate that it isn't yet another image of a woman
    as a sex object and then chuckle when the image itself is dismissed.\r\n\r\nOnly,
    apparently, I was completely wrong about all of that. Oh well. I'll come up with
    something more appropriate.\r\n\r\nI'd hoped that a slightly unconventional spread
    would work given that I'm pushing n!samual as nontraditional but suitable for
    text, but I guess that gets weakened if I don't show it performing well in a traditional
    application. I'll make something bland that screams 1:1.62, after all, the other
    samples of n!samual are, well, a little different.\r\n\r\nThe gy lig was done
    on a lark and you are totally right about it.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the feedback,
    you've given me a lot to think about."

    read it should be set at a high quality and that would include the areas around
    the ear, top of the counter and left side of the lower bowl of your g. The text
    in black may look better if it weren't hyphenated. \r\nIf you have to explain
    a joke it probably isn't worth the telling. I think your thinking is sound(ish)
    the images just don't quite do it if the models clearly didn't represent the ideals
    of classic beauty while still having a certain something, and here we get into
    depths of subjectivity, the joke might work better.\r\nI don't get the 1:1.62

  body: Noah, I think the concept for those two ads is fun! However, I don't think
    you've fully explored your execution options. Are they posters or ads. I read
    them as ads because of the horizontal  nature, don't hate me I'm a vertical poster
    lover. Can you rotate or are you locked in? Watch the K in that ad, it looks as
    if it doesn't match the rest of the letters. Did you enlarge it?

    \"Doc\" Smith</a>, food scientist turned author, is commonly regarded as the granddaddy
    of Space Opera. His influence persists to this day. If you enjoyed Babylon 5,
    Star Wars, Star Trek, or a dozen other popular television series, movies, and
    novels you've enjoyed brain-candy he made possible. I've been a fan of his work
    since the age of 15. It's a challenge to describe his style save by analogy. Here
    in Baltimore we have something called <a href=\"http://www.bergercookies.com/history.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Berger cookies</a>. Imagine an oversweet, dense cookie smothered
    in the cheapest, least nuanced chocolate you've ever tasted. They hit the stomach
    like lead but they're impossible to stop eating. The Lensmen series is the reading
    equivalent of eating Berger cookies. \r\n\r\n<strong>Timd</strong>, you said a
    traditional page spread, what do you think of <strong><a href=\"http://www.grodworks.com/temp/lensmen4.pdf\"
    target=\"_blank\">this?</a></strong> The text is from the Foreword to book four
    of the Lensmen series, <em>Grey Lensman</em>. In case you're curious I didn't
    use the ratio phi (the 1:1.62 reference you didn't comprehend), instead I made
    the page 2:3 and the textblock 1:1.7. Sadly, Doc's work is not yet in the public
    domain or I'd have happily set the entire series as a public service.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tiffany</strong>
    Thanks for the feedback, using those images in a vertical poster is an interesting
    challenge, but I've a few ideas. That 'K' has been nothing but trouble since the
    day it was drawn.\r\n\r\nYou've both been very helpful and the next iteration
    of samples and posters and stuff is definitely improved for it. Thanks, and I
    hope you'll continue to critique when I add more samples.\r\nYours,\r\nNoah"

    angle bleeding off rounded boxes is tricky. The second line of Fu Manchu\u2019s
    description is falling a bit short of the measure. As for the justification that
    is entirely up to you (although I cannot remember the last time I saw a novel

    throw some of it away (or at least store it away for another day), and focus.
    Let the font do more talking than you.\r\n\r\nTrying to get specific:\r\nThe two
    things that stand out for me are the human bodies, and the way you're using letterforms
    for whitespace and boundaries. For example I think you can indeed use sex, and
    even have some plays-on-word in the \"background\", but do it more tastefully,
    with more focus. Like the woman might need to be \"grubby chic\" style (not so
    80s), maybe heavily posterized and in sepia (or another tone). You know what I
    mean? More abstract, more reserve on the surface, hiding the strong expression/idea
    under the surface, leaving more to the imagination. And I really like that \"e\".
