  body: I don't get you Henrik... What are you after? An exact match for looks hand-drawn
    or a base font to reproduce it? Because DIN (1451) Engschrift as suggested by
    Bob would perfectly do the job.

  body: hej Ryuk - it's a scan from a document from 1930's  from the whole alfabet
    - and most of the font looks like DIN 1451 - except those character i uploaded
    - so i am just searching to see if this is a scan of an official lesserknown DIN
    or maybe it a custom job ..
