body: What exactly does it mean for type to be &#34;fussy&#34;? I&#39;ve seen the
  term used in Typophile discussions as well as other sites. Any other terms I should
  be aware of? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison

  body: Good question. I myself don&#39;t hear it too often &#40;fortunately&#41;,
    although recently on SpeakUp &#40;which I rarely frequent, only because I have
    to draw the line <i>somewhere</i> :-&#41; somebody was defending the use of Times
    because it &#34;wasn&#39;t fussy&#34;. Which is pretty funny because Times is
    strongly self-conscious - in a way it&#39;s really a display face. <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get a consensus, just a vague feeling. <BR> <BR>To
    me it means &#34;detailed&#34; in a self-conscious way. Minimalists like their
    bread dry, and they tend to confuse the power of expression with fussiness. <BR>
    <BR>A more focused term might be &#34;mannered&#34;, which is actually used in
    a sufficiently coherent way by a number of designers. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    or &#39;simple&#39;. <BR>But I&#39;m not sure.

  body: I equate fussy with &#39;over-designed&#39; or even &#39;unskillfully tweaked&#39;.
    But it&#39;s usually in the details. I also think of a design that&#39;s focused
    on details but not the whole picture. For example, the type may all be nicely
    set, but all the typeset elements are competing because no clear decision was
    made as to what was and wasn&#39;t important.

  body: Hmmm... I&#39;ve heard Minion referred to as fussy -- I always considered
    it a pretty good text face. Realizing that &#34;fussy&#34; is probably somewhat
    subjective, it appears that &#34;fancy&#34; and &#34;showy&#34; could be interchanged.
    Are types like Bodoni and Fleischmann considered &#34;fussy&#34; or are they simply
    not good for long text? I suppose it would apply only to types that attempt to
    be suitable for longer reading.

  body: Interesting question. Chris&#39; thoughts reflect my own. Fussy is a word
    that I associate with my Grandma&#39;s house ... or ... anything that requires
    more work than it is worth.

    is actually incredibly good for text&#41; can be seen as &#34;fussy&#34;, but
    Bodoni is pretty austere &#40;at least the Roman&#41;. But again, Modernists tend
    to see fussiness where it&#39;s just Life instead. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'I did call Minion fussy on these boards. Then I got Minion Pro, and found
    it not fussy. I just now took the trouble to try to compare the letter forms large.  <BR>
    <BR>Minion Pro slightly thickens the serifs at the tips. I think that did it.
    To me the original was a little too calligraphic in its finish.  Minion Pro is
    also very subtly refitted, but you can definitely notice the difference when you
    set text in both as I have - Minion Pro is more compact, and the color is better.  <BR>
    <BR>Fussy to me is decorative elements that don&#39;t harmonize with the overall
    design. In this case, I think it was the sharper serifs &#40;same length&#41;
    that were to me fussy. I first got on these boards to ask about Minion, and felt
    pretty happy later when I found out that Slimbach had corrected just what I had
    felt was wrong, but couldn&#39;t put my finger on.  <BR> <BR>I think that the
    Victorian period had a lot of fussy design, but this may be more true of the later
    Victorian periond - I don&#39;t know enough of the history.  <BR> <BR>I also said
    I find the serifs in Hoefer&#39;s Requium fussy - apparently I&#39;m the very
    distinct minority.  <BR> <BR>I am not against ornament, but I think it is hard
    to bring off well. When it is brought off well it is breathtaking, a tour de force.
    Probably it is out of place in text type.   <BR>  <BR> <BR>   <BR> '

  body: It seems that fussy type is precisely that -- it fusses too much. It demands
    attention when it should be quiet and allow itself to be read. <BR> <BR>That Tate
    id is pretty cool. It&#39;s an interesting method for getting variety out of a
    program.

  body: so Minion Pro is a preffered typeface to Minion? <BR>I&#39;ll have to use
    it sometime. <BR>The only example of a book I&#39;ve seen set in Minion left a
    bad taste in my mouth. But I think it has more to do with layout then the face.
    I&#39;m a student so I don&#39;t want to hold a prejudice against Minion,  any
    body know of any good example of it&#39;s use.... <BR>thanks

    at 300 pt, set with Illustrator CS.  <BR> <BR>I find it quite interesting, having
    seen the effect on the set type, and knowing that Slimbach is a master who here
    had another crack at improving the type for fit and color, a number of years later.
    <BR> <BR>You will notice that the serifs and thins are noticeably thickened, and
    that the o is not only thicker, but narrower. The overall effect when set is that
    the type is sturdier and sets narrower. The new Pro regular now sets nearly as
    compact as the old display weight, which was lighter than the old regular. '

  body: According to the Adobe web site, Minion was released in 1990, and Minion Pro
    in 2000. In between, I believe, a multiple master version was sold. What I find
    most interesting about this is that in the ten years, evidently Slimbach concluded
    - probably from feedback or experience with other faces - that digital text type
    should be slightly darker than he had originally thought was appropriate.   <BR>

    now. I hope the gods of type won&#39;t strike me down if I say that I can&#39;t
    stand the italics. When I&#39;m reading anyway. I find them fussy, too mannered,
    and disturbing. Too dark also.
