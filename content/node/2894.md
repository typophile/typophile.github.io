    law system which still requires Courier for official documents.

    my god. The worst part is that they <i>specifically restrict</i> the layout to
    those standards. <BR> <BR>When will the tyranny of the typewriter end?

  body: I&#39;m sorry, that sounded like a repitition of what Stephen said. To clarify,
    they stipulate ridiculous size, line length, and line spacing restrictions, on
    top of the font, that are all designed &#40;it seems&#41; to maximize the dischord
    between any given typographic element.

    the Democrates get back in they will go with something like Bookman Bold Italic
    Swash. They&#39;ll show them Republicans '

  body: Good, now we can forge government documents. We know the font and size. Huzzah.
    :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;Um, George, we&#39;re setting all of our documents in Times
    at 14pt now. So if you can just go ahead and use times on all of your diplomatic
    correspondence, yeah. Did you get that memo?&#34;
