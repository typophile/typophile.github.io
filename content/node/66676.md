  design/typography style this is considered? Also, what are some good resources online
  for finding examples of this style and designers who can do this.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nJoshua\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image_5133.jpg]"

    find a little more of what you are looking for. \r\n\r\nSome design firms to check
    out who do this type of work:\r\n\r\nwww.ptarmak.com\r\nwww.gardnerdesign.com\r\nwww.muccadesign.com\r\nwww.louisefili.com\r\n\r\nIf
    you are looking for someone more on a freelance basis to do a specific project
    for you, I know a few designers who have a knack for this, let me know if that
    is the case. Just know that type of design can be incredibly time consuming and
    not cheap. "
