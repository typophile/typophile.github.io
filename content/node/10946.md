  body: Aloys Senefelder invented lithography sometime in the late 18th century, I
    think. I am reasonably sure, although my memory often fails me, that he was attempting
    to create a chemical printing process to cheaply reproduce copies of plays or
    stories he had written. He wrote a book about the invention of the process which
    is pretty detailed. Read it in school years ago, portions of it at least, but
    can&#39;t remember title offhand.

    quite how the story goes.

  body: 'Tiffany, <BR> <BR>I think the story goes more or less like that. Summary
    from the Catholic Encyclopedia: <BR> <BR><i>The death of his father forced him
    to give up his studies in order to support his mother and eight sisters and brothers.
    After attempting to become an actor, he took up dramatic writing, at which he
    was at first fairly successful. Because of difficulty in finding a publisher,
    he tried to devise means for printing his productions himself, and began a series
    of experiments with etching and copper-plates until he discovered, in 1796, that
    Kilheim lime-stone could be used for the purpose.</i> <BR> <BR>I vote for Joshua.

  body: I wasn&#39;t trying to be nitpicky. Promise. --- From what I remember from
    the printing history lectures it was something along the lines of his having made
    notes or something or other onto stone with a grease pen of some kind. He left
    these out in the barn. It rained. He noticed that the water didn&#39;t stick to
    the grease. From that he had his <i>Aha!</i> moment. --- He was working toward
    publishing his own plays, as Joshua mentioned. Anyway. Go ahead Joshua.

  body: Not sure if there was more to the story. That description of the &#34;how&#34;
    is, at least as I can remember, from Senefelder&#39;s own description of the process,
    which the only original source documentation on the discovery in existence. I
    am wracking my mind trying to remember if there was something else going on, but
    I just can&#39;t seem to remember. You&#39;ll have to fill me in.

  body: I&#39;m going to answer Joshua&#39;s query anyway, whether or not the question
    is actually in play.  <BR>  <BR>The typefaces in question were typewriter fonts
    -- for use such that commercially printed correspondence might look as though
    it had been typewritten. These fonts were sometimes printed through silk to simulate
    the effect of the typewriter ribbon and further enhance the illusion.  <BR>  <BR>--

  body: 'Gerald -- <BR> <BR>I have no firsthand experience in this. But I&#39;ll quote
    to you from the 1923 ATF Book: <BR> <BR><blockquote>&#34;. . . The accurately
    designed typewriter faces offered by the American Type founders Company, in such
    wide variety, afford every printer the opportunity of engaging in the printing
    of imitation typewritten letters to whatever extent he chooses.  <BR> <BR>&#34;The
    type here shown, 12 point New Model Smith-Premier, is designed to be printed through
    silk, crepe chiffon or regular ribbon cloth. By varying the quality and amount
    of cloth used an impression of any weight and character may be obtained. The ribbon
    cloth is heaviest, and gives most weight to the type face; crepe chiffon is lightest.
    <BR> <BR>&#34;If addresses are to be filled in on the typewriter, have the stenographer
    of the firm for whom the work is to be done write a sample letter. Use this as
    a color sheet and have the pressman work on it, for the depth of color and the
    weight of the impression may easily be controlled on the press, while it is impossible
    to do this on the typewriter.&#34;</blockquote> <BR> <BR>In Joshua&#39;s question,
    the &#34;for silk and plain printing&#34; was the giveaway. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: 'The process is described it more detail in the 1906 edition: <BR> <BR>&#34;This
    work can best be done by printing through crepe chiffon streached on the grippers,
    leaving the cloth a little slack. And using Process Inks. This method gives most
    satisfactory results when used on a platen press. At all times have the chiffon
    washed thoroughly with soap and water before using. When on a cylinder press,
    use Japanese silk of good quality, but light in weight. Put the silk through the
    same preparations as the chiffon; lock it up loosely in the form, between the
    type and the furniture; draw several impressions from double thickness of stock
    to be used on job so as to form a matrix of the cloth. Use CLEAN rollers and bearers.
    Use ribbons that are made from the same ink, for filling in names and addresses.
    <BR> <BR>&#34;You can then have tha assurance that the ink used in printing will
    exactly match the ribbon used on the typewriter for filling in the address. <BR>
    <BR>&#34;Distribute the Process Ink on the plate as usual, then put in form. The
    first few rollings will saturate the silk with ink and it will act as an inked
    ribbon, biving an impression like that of a typewriting machine. The silk will
    last a long time and when filled up can be washed in benzine and used again.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>The sample pages are quite convincing.'

    we might need new Rules, covering how long the person who asked the question has
    to name a winner, and what happens if he doesn&#39;t end up naming a winner. Actually,
    it&#39;s trickier than that - in fact it seems we&#39;d need a lattice of new
    Rules to cover certain behaviors on the part of the person who asked the question
    - but maybe it&#39;s not worth ironing it all out unless it&#39;s actually needed.
