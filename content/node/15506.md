  body: "I think it is normal.\r\nI'm not saying that your code is correct, but from
    what I heard, \r\ndespite some of the Pro fonts containing the locl feature, the
    latest\r\nversion of InDesign, CS2, still does not support it yet.\r\nBut keep
    the feature in your font, because future versions will."
