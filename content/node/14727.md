  2.0 we came across the following terms that we could not translate easily. Can anybody
  amongst you typophiles explain the terms and/or give a Dutch translation for them?<ul><li>\"running
  title\"</li>\r\n<li>\"floating title\"</li></ul>\r\nBoth were used in the context
  of \"How to insert a running/floating title in the header\".\r\n\r\nSo far searching
  the web has made me believe that a running title is the (abbreviated) title of a
  chapter which was often printed in the header of each page.\r\nFor a floating title
  I've found two explanations: the first is a title printed inside a chapter which
  does not cause a change in the chapter title for the text following the floating
  title; the second is a subtitle for the chapter title.\r\n\r\nHope that someone
  her can shed some light on this...\r\n\r\nRegards, Jigal."

  body: Your definition for "running title" is correct; for "floating title," the
    second is more accurate.
