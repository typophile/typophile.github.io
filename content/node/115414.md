  body: "This might exist as a font, but I don't recall seeing it.\r\nIf you want
    just the stencil R, its very easy to make from Champ Ultra http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/champ-ultra/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChampUltraAsStencil_3815.jpg]\r\nThe
    original is the black outline, the red is the edited result. No curves were modified.
    Some positions were shifted and cove serifs were changed to square slab. Note
    that after the stencil is cut, the RHS is shifted to the right.\r\nDon"
