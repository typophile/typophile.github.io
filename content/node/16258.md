  with fonts, but for a work i need to use Meridien (Linotype Library);\r\nproblem:
  i have Meridien Roman, but not the Bold one, so i was wondering what Font i might
  use in place of Meridien preserving its grace-effect (lovely font!), since i don't
  have a credit card and i can't buy the font over the internet.\r\n\r\nthanks for
  reading."
