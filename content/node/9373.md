body: 'In languages with accents, an all-cap layout can present problems: they get
  in the way. <BR> <BR>There are a couple of &#34;cheats&#34; .  <BR> <BR>In French,
  for instance, using a Didot face, the grave, acute, and circumflex may become a
  thin horizontal line, with context providing sufficient cues for the reader. Some
  typographers will even leave the accents off completely. <BR> <BR>In German, the
  umlaut appears in only two cap characters, the Odieresis and the Udieresis. Consequently,
  there is the marvelous &#34;Mickey Mouse&#34; Odieresis of Futura Extra Bold &#40;not
  available in digital&#41;. <BR> <BR>My question is: do the Odieresis and Udieresis
  only appear in German? If so, does it make sense to give these characters &#34;dropped&#34;
  accents in the standard Latin encoding? Here&#39;s what they would look like in
  a display Roman.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/65849.jpg"

    two, in fact.

  body: I believe Welsh uses WY and English &#40;rarely&#41; uses I with diaeresis
    so they can be accommodate dropped accents. However the O and U look like emoticons.
    I understood that French doesn&#39;t use accents at all on uppercase. <BR>Tim

  body: '<i>do the Odieresis and Udieresis only appear in German?</i> <BR> <BR>They
    are used in other languages as well: Turkish and Hungarian use both, and Finnish
    uses Odieresis &#40;and Adieresis&#41;, while Estonian uses A-,O-, and Udieresis.
    There may be others, but these are ones I can think of right away.'

    in the standard Latin encoding? <BR> <BR>simple answer: NO!!! These designs belongs
    to lead types / letters - mostly to the bigger ones, the titlings. It was a technical
    issue. An other &#34;solution&#34; was, to lower the caps high e.g. 90% compared
    to the regular caps, to get some space for the umlaut.'

    but i don&#39;t think this would be a solution. we have a poster campaign for
    a museum in vienna at the moment where exactly that problem occurs, and they decided
    to use the ligatures. <BR>unfortunately the only example that i found doesn&#39;t
    have an umlaut. but you&#39;ll get an impression:  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.liechtensteinmuseum.at/de/pages/home.asp"

    showed your post to Anke, who is. <BR> <BR>Anke has no problems reading the O
    and A umlats, but doesn&#39;t feel comfortable with the U&#39;s. Anke is not a
    type designer. I don&#39;t know if that makes her opinion more, or less, valid
    ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Just for comparison &#40;and fun

  body: Well, Swedish having both Odieresis and Aring scuttles my idea. If I drop
    the umlaut but can&#39;t drop the ring, the setting will be inconsistent. &#40;Dropping
    it just enough to connect, as in Stephen&#39;s example, is nowhere near enough
    to lower it as much as in the Odieresis.&#41;
