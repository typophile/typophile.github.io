  body: "Looks like Busorama customized (phototype).\r\n\r\n(Edit-a-bit): Though it
    was probably pre-ITC and may have come from the PLINC library. VGC also offered
    Omnibus (and I don't know for certain which came first since Omnibus is sampled
    in the 1972 VGC catalog)."

    better about my hunting skills!\r\n\r\nLove that one too, Mark. A lot of great
    poster art, and then we get stuck with poor photo-montage DVD covers!"

    a fire! :-)\r\n\r\nMy absolute favourite is <a href=\"http://www.theforce.net/collecting/posters/esb/15-anniv.asp\">this
    one</a> because it's my favourite character from my favourite movie. Tick and
    tick. The only (sort of) drawback is that it's printed on mylar so it's shiny
    and reflective, which always makes people say it looks like of those beer mirrors
    you find at a bar. Hehe."

    a place to look? - I would love to see what the set looks like beyond the poster
