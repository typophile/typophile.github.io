body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/irricad_4067.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm trying to
  identify the above font. From my online research it seems closest to the lowercase
  letters of the DTC Plaza family, but the C and the A are not quite right.\r\n\r\nThis
  is from a logo designed many years ago - so it is probably an older font, if that
  helps.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nDan"

  body: Thanks for the pointer, it is similar. But that seems to be a general problem
    with this one - it is 'almost like' two or three fonts...
