  body: The lowercase suspiciously looks like <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?8TM"
    target="_blank"> Stuyvesant Solid</a>, while  <BR>the capital S is very similar
    to one found in <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/zapfino/linotypezapfino-two/mac-t1/154464/character/0053/CP4/1/"
    target="_blank"> Linotype Zapfino</a>. <BR>Maybe it&#39;s one of the many OpenType
    alternate glyphs?

  body: It is indeed -- from Zapfino Two. The sample from the Script Font ID Guide
    is below. &#40;I also agree with the Stuyvesant solid ID&#41;. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/62739.gif"
