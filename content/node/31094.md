body: "It's been over 10 years now that I have been making and selling my fonts. In
  celebration of this anniversary, I have created a catalog of my complete retail
  font library. \r\n\r\nThis is no normal type specimen book, though. I wrote a completely
  original pangram for nearly every font in the catalog. This makes for some interesting
  reading, so please enjoy!\r\n\r\nI would like to give thanks to Mark Simonson for
  creating the <a href=\"http://ms-studio.com/Animation/pangrammerhelper.html\" target=\"new\">Pangrammer
  Helper</a> that I used to make my pangrams.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.madtype.net/pdf/2007_MADType_Catalog.pdf\">Download
  the MADType 2007 Anniversary Catalog Here</a>. (PDF, 744 KB)\r\n\r\nOr for more

    of the catalog. Lucy just keeps to herself.
