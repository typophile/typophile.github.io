body: I have defined anchor attachment for mark positioning in MS VOLT for certain
  glyphs which working fine. When I create another lookup even with a different anchor
  name for position the marks on a glyph with context before condition, the previous
  default positioning works only and the contextual position does not work, however
  when I do the same with Context After, that works fine. Can anybody help me please?
