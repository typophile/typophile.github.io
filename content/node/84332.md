body: "I'm interested in the problem of adapting non-Western scripts to the constraints
  of a monospaced terminal font. This generally means fitting each character to something
  like a 8x16 or 16x16 grid.\r\n\r\nThe limited flexibility of a small grid and the
  requirement of even character width can really pose a challenge. To get a feeling
  for how to manage different types of scripts, I have been working on a series of
  specimen fonts in which the Latin alphabet is cast in an exotic style.\r\n\r\nI
  felt that the most elemental design would consist of just strait lines, so I chose
  runes as the model for the first font. Rather than modifying Latin letters to look
  runish, most of the characters are authentic runes that have been turned or squeezed
  a bit to look like Latin letters.\r\n\r\nHow would you evaluate the result as a
  text face? I know it's awful, but exactly why is it? When faced with a script of
  this sort, what can be done to make it more readable?\r\n\r\nOne thing I already
  learned is the need to have the horizonal extremes occur mostly at the same height,
  otherwise the letter-spacing is terrible.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/1234/hackerrune.png\">\r\n"
