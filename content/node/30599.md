  body: Nice classical look. I see some potential kerning problems, though. The tail
    of the <em>l</em>, for instance, while it looks good in isolation, demands too
    much room when set in a word. Also, the <em>g</em> is a bit hard to recognize.

  body: "Good point about the <em>l</em>. I'll eliminate the tail and see what happens.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the <em>g</em>, yeah, maybe I'll make it a single-storey, or reverse the direction
    of the hook.\r\n\r\nI'll post the correction soon. Thanks for the feedback!\r\n\r\nAny
    more critiques?"
