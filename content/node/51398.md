body: "Hello everyone :)\r\nI've just registered in Typophile, and I'm a third year
  graphic design student at the American university of Beirut, Lebanon.\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on my logo, and my identity as a designer, and since I'm interested in Arabic
  type, I made my logo in a way that reflects this interest.\r\n\r\nI'm just looking
  for some feedback from non-Arabs, because I feel it would be very helpful and beneficial
  to me.\r\n\r\nmy picture is attached (there was a problem inserting the image)\r\n\r\nLooking
  forward for any reply.\r\n\r\nThank you :)"

    style.  Since you want people to remember the name correctly in their mind, I
    think you should alter the Seen which looks like Raa now.  A hint of teeth may
    be one way, but probably best would be to have the pointy stem pointing south
    west!\r\n\r\n-Saad\r\n\r\nhttp://arabetics.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
