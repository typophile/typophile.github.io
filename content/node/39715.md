  father's gravestone,</a> I've become fascinated with the gravestones of designers,
  typographers, stone carvers/lettering artists etc. Many are beyond gorgeous, all
  are of extraordinary quality.\r\n\r\nI've found William Morris's tombstone, but
  I've been unable to find Josef Hoffman. I suspect I'm googling in the wrong language
  to find it? If anybody has a picture of Josef Hoffman's gravestone, or any other
  legendary designers, I'd love to see them. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_morris_william2_gb_5809.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WilliamMorrisTombstone_6241.jpg]"

  body: "One typographic notable had his headstone already cut except for the last
    date, long before he died. It stood ready in the barn at his New Hampshire home.\r\n\r\nNot
    many folks any longer recall Professor Ray Nash. He was a long-time teacher of
    art (maybe art history, actually) at Dartmouth College, and he wrote often about
    handwriting, calligraphy, & printing. He ran a teaching press at Dartmouth where
    he taught such folks as printer Rocky Stinehour and letterer extraordinaire Stephen
    Harvard. I spent the summer of 1975 (?) at his farm, with about 6 other young
    printing and type enthusiasts, working on iron hand presses in that barn.\r\n\r\n&
    there in the corner stood the black stone, rounded top and all. I believe Stephen
    Harvard had cut the letters. I assume he finished the job when Ray died in 1982.
    Maybe I'll go find his last resting place when I'm in New England in June and
    see if I can get a photo. & post it here.\r\n\r\npowers \r\n\r\n"

    headstones (mostly older). \r\n\r\nPaul Rand's tombstone is pretty stunning. Not
    only is it not your standard tombstone shape, but it uses two different types
    of stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CLRykq3wuc1ho8cs4G0WiQnX_500_6531.jpg]"
