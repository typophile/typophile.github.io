  body: "I've been a designer for twenty years, for what that's worth. As I read your
    description, I pictured a Medium to Bold sans serif (my opinion is that serifs
    are too friendly, for the most part) with a black to white (or light gray) gradient
    north to south. All caps. Something simple that communicates.\r\n\r\nYou can experiment
    with condensed fonts, like Compacta or Futura Ex Bold Condensed, or lean more
    contemporary like Scala Sans or Meta Black. \r\n\r\nHope this gets you thinking
    and maybe you can come up with your own idea. \r\n"

  body: "If this is the logo for a documentary why do you say that it can't be a display
    type? Seems like that would be a good place for a display type.  \r\n\r\nI'm sitting
    here next to a poster of ITC/Fontek typefaces, which may not be the freshest designs,
    but they are old enough to start being new to some people, perhaps. My first candidates
    I would test out are [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/atmosphere-itc/|ITC
    Atmosphere]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/arid-itc/|ITC Arid]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/riptide-itc/|ITC
    Riptide]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/lino-cut/|Lino Cut]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/schizoid-itc/|ITC
    Schizoid]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-kendo/|ITC Kendo]].
    To me all of these might fit the notion of something drying up, and almost vanishing
    in some cases. Some are coarser and more literal than others, and I think there
    are other potential fonts in just the ITC/Fontek collection. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
