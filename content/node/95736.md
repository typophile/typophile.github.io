  sans (ala Avant Garde, Futura, and the like). I've got most of my glyphs made up
  and now comes the fun and hard part: spacing and kerning. I'm mostly interested
  in workflow, since a lot of you are quite experienced I figured I'd try to gleam
  some information from the veterans. Do you start by setting all your glyphs' side
  bearings to 0 and work out from there? Do you set all your glyphs to a certain width
  and bring them in or out? What's the best method?\r\n\r\nThanks so much for any
  help."

  body: Sounds good. In my case it'll be more geared at a display font but I was thinking
    if I get the spacing even and optically correct that I could track it in for larger
    sizes. I'm more interested in the process of adjusting the side bearings and kerning.
    What is the typical workflow.

  body: "HHOHOO nnonoo 000 are my key characters to determine spacing. Set these up
    and space them manually until you get the spacing effect you want. I usually do
    these before I begin the work of digitizing the entire font.\r\n\r\nMeasure the
    space between the stems of the HH, between the stem and curve of HO, and between
    the curves of OO; repeat for the lowercase nn, no, oo and the zeros. If the font
    you were working on had serifs, you would ignore the serifs for the purpose of
    determining spacing.\r\n\r\nEverything else works off these numbers with adjustment
    for one side of those characters which don't fall into the basic shape of H and
    O or n and o, i.e. optical adjustments. Whatever character width you end up with
    for a zero becomes the character width for all numbers although for display faces
    this is sometimes not true. Punctuation and special characters need to be set
    up between the same key characters above and the best spacing determined for them.\r\n\r\nThis
    technique will also allow you to set up far fewer kern pairs than you might need
    otherwise. It all depends on the design of the font.\r\n\r\nBasically, that's
    it. I've been doing it this way for years."

    How-To section]] of the Typowiki, particularly those by Briem and by Jamra.\r\n\r\nI
    would advise you to not even think about kerning until you have the general spacing
    down cold. It's best to think of spacing to kerning as a one-way street."

    and the black bodies) has to be linked.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Thanks for the tips guys. I started by zeroing out the LSB and RSB and then
    worked with the o's and then n's and used those as a start. It's a great learning
    process.
