  was introduced to attendants of a conference  <a href=\"http://typographicbeirut.lau.edu.lb/\">Typo.Graphic.Beirut</a>
  by Filip Bla\u017Eek. The aim of this project is to build a free on-line database
  of knowledge and experience -- how to design correct diacritics: what size, shape
  and position an accent should have. Text concerning the history, use, languages
  and also some technical information is related to each diacritical mark. The project
  web site is based on wiki: after a simple registration, anyone can append or correct
  any published text or upload pictures. There is no need for special knowledge of
  HTML code, the editing is also similar to Wikipedia. \r\n\r\nThe project (in English
  only) is on-line at <a href=\"http://diacritics.typo.cz\"><strong>diacritics.typo.cz</strong></a>.
  \r\n\r\nContributions are welcome."
