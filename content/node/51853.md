  body: "My favorite long sentence (and one that I sometimes use for testing text
    settings) is this one from the \"Back to Sleep\" issue of the Pushpin Graphic
    (Number 74):\r\n\r\nA BORING STORY\r\n\r\nI had just written checks for all the
    bills that were due that month, and I wanted to go to the post office to get some
    stamps and mail those checks out, and since I was going in that direction anyway,
    I thought that I might just as well go to the town dump as well, since I had some
    trash that needed throwing out, so I put the trash in some of those white plastic
    bags that you get nowadays, and I started looking around for some of those little
    wire twisty things that come with the plastic bags, but there wasn\u2019t any,
    leastways, if there was any I couldn\u2019t find them, and I looked around pretty
    carefully, but it didn\u2019t matter much because I just twisted the tops of the
    plastic bags around like into a kind of rope and put a knot in them, which works
    almost as well as the little twisty things, sometimes better if the bag\u2019s
    not too full, and I put the trash in the trunk of my car, and then I had to make
    another trip back to the house because I\u2019d almost forgotten those checks
    that I wanted to mail, but in the end I did remember them so I went back and got
    them and then I took off down the road towards the dump, and when I got there
    I left the motor running while I got out and went around to the trunk and got
    the garbage out, lifting the bags by the knotted top parts, and I gave them a
    pretty good heave into the trash pit that they have at the dump there, then I
    got back in the car and drove off to the post office, but I hadn\u2019t gotten
    more than a half a mile from the dump when I happened to glance down at the fuel
    gauge and I noticed that there was less than a quarter of a tank of gas in the
    car, which represents about three gallons, and since my car gets about thirty
    miles per gallon, I could have driven another ninety miles without putting a drop
    more gasoline in the tank, and I wouldn\u2019t have had to sweat it at all, especially
    since the round trip to the post office and back to my house wasn\u2019t more
    than five miles at best, so it shouldn\u2019t have made much difference whether
    I bought more gas or not, (not for that day, anyway) but I got to thinking in
    a philosophical sort of way about how you never know what life\u2019s going to
    bring you from day to day, and while I didn\u2019t have anything planned that
    would require a lot of driving, still, I figured, it wasn\u2019t going to hurt
    me to put that gasoline in now rather than later, and that way I\u2019d be prepared
    for anything that might come up, at least with regard to any gasoline that I might
    need, so what I did was when I got to the post office, I went right on past it,
    just like it wasn\u2019t there, and I continued on down the street to this gas
    station that I knew about that was about six blocks further on the opposite side
    of the street, but I figured that once I got in there and got my gas, I could
    just turn around right in the station there and then I\u2019d be headed in the
    right direction to scoot right on back to the post office, which, though you might
    think otherwise, I hadn\u2019t forgot about in the least, so I pulled on into
    the gas station, making sure to keep the pumps on my left, because on my car that\u2019s
    the side that\u2019s got the little gas filler thing and if you get on the wrong
    side sometimes and you haven\u2019t pulled up close enough, then they have a hard
    time reaching it with the hose and if that happens then you\u2019ve got to start
    the car up again and move it a little closer, and as I was pulling up I rolled
    right over that rubber hose that they put out that makes a clanging noise inside
    the station so they know that somebody\u2019s pulled up and wants gas, and it
    made that clanging noise and within half a minute or so this guy comes out wiping
    his hands on an old rag or something, because he musta been workin\u2019 on something
    greasy inside, and he didn\u2019t say a word or anything, he just went right to
    the pump, took the nozzle out of its holder there and cranked the crank on the
    side of the pump that sets all the numbers back to zero on all the little dials,
    and he proceeded to pump the gas, so I leaned my head out the window and told
    him to make it three dollars worth since all I had with me was five dollars and
    I had to save some of that to buy stamps with at the post office, but actually
    I got about three dollars and three cents worth because those pumps pump pretty
    fast and I guess he couldn\u2019t shut it off exactly on the nose, but he only
    charged me three dollars anyway since I guess that three cents didn\u2019t make
    much difference to him, but at any rate I gave him the five dollar bill and I
    waited while he went back in the station and got the change because I guess it\u2019s
    hard to carry change in your pockets when you are wearing overalls like he was,
    and when he came back and gave me my two dollars I told him I hoped he would have
    a nice day and then I started my car up and turned it around right in the station
    there and headed on back to the post office, where I had to wait a bit in line
    but I did get those stamps.\r\n\r\nI don't know who wrote it. It was set in three
    ever-smaller sizes depending on the degree of insomnia one was trying to overcome."

    looking for something more intentional there's always the <em>Molly Bloom's Soliloquy</em>;
    the final chapter in Joyce's Ulysses with Molly Bloom's thoughts written as a
    stream of consciousness. It's not without punctuation, but they are few. "

    If memory doesn't fail, Wolfe pulled a similar stunt in his "Electric Kool-Aid
    Acid Test" as well. (Don't have either book to hand at present, elsewise I'd provide
    specific references. Sorry.)
