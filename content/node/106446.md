  review it and tell me what you think about it."

    a bit off with the stroke modulation. I can see the logic on the N/M though"

  body: "I like it quite well, it's original and has a certain drive.\r\n\r\nI agree
    with Michael's comments, though. That {A} doesn't quite work for me. Also, the
    bottom of the {a} looks pinched and somewhat out of place among the other letters.
    \ The crossbar of {F} is a bit timid.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

    more of this\r\n\r\n***edit - when I say heavier what I really mean is less whitespace"

  body: The descending T is confusing and likely to be taken for a J as often as not.
    Probably should just truncate it at the baseline.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ashfont2014_4619.png]\r\n\r\nI was continuing
    the development of this font, but I lost the SVG file on which I had laid out
    its elements. I tried to match the original as best as I could, with some stylistic
    changes here and there. As for major changes, A M N no longer have stroke modulation,
    P T \xDE now end at the baseline, and the diagonals on K X k v w x are now uniform."
