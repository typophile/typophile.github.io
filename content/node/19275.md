  a little more personality?  I am doing my wedding invite, and I've decided I really
  like a bold graphic look.  But impact might be to boring.  What do you think?  Is
  impact out of style, or not the right thing for a wedding annoucenment?   (I don't
  really like any script fonts, I like clean and simple and graphic)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nBrice"

  body: "Impact does not strike me as a natural for a wedding invitation... Maybe
    consider something a little more elegant, such as HTF Gotham condensed? Or Neutraface
    condensed?\r\n\r\nYou should re-post this query in the \"design\" section of this
    site, however, this is not the right place for this question."
