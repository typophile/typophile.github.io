  body: "I've also been running into some trouble trying to locate a copy. I know
    of one sample (a logo design that I am not yet at liberty to display; portion
    of it shown) and many online mentions regarding its similarity to Eras-if-it-had-serifs.
    It is actually quite different from Basilia. If I can sleuth out the foundry,
    I'll repost.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cinema_basilea_5295.jpg]"

  body: Basilea (as shown in ampersandranch's entry above) is utterly elegant. I used
    to use it on a Typositor 30 years ago. Why it's not available digitally is beyond
    me. Or is it? Please let me know. All I have now is printed in an old Andresen
    Typographics (L.A.) font showing catalog. I don't have autotrace, but do have
    an old Fontographer 4.x for mac OS 8.6 but have never used it. If I did, what
    licensing issues would I encounter? Could I alter the letterforms slightly and
    rename it and make it available?
