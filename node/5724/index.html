  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Washington, USA&ndash;The Office of Homeland Security announced today that it has denied entry visas to two suspected &quot;Typoterrorists,&quot; Yuri Yarmola of Russia and Adam Twardoch a Polish national said to be domiciled in Berlin, both belonging to a subversive organization known as &quot;Font Lab.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;We have solid information,&quot; said Attorney General John Ashcroft, &quot;that this Font Lab has been amassing huge quantities of yellow cake (with chocolate frosting) along with gallons of Borsht, which if left unrefridgerated for a few days, is capable of producing biological agents.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;In addition,&quot; Ashcroft said during closed prayer meetings with choir boys,&quot; we've received &quot;hints&quot; that this tightly kerned terrorist font cell known as 'The Metrics&quot; had attended font schools in the United States asking to be taught how to handle fonts, but not how to land them.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Commenting on the case at an emergency press conference, President Bush stated, &quot;We know that this Font Lab was close to developing Weapons of Font Instruction. How do we know it? Because we just do! Because I said so! Well for one thing the terrorists Yarmola and Twardoch don't own oil companies and they aren't millionaires and their names sound&hellip;unusually  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->suspicious and unAmerican. Secondly, I'm pretty sure that the words Type and Terrorism both start with the letter 'T' and that's all the proof I need.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yarmola had previously been admitted to the US where he attended a Type conference and was spotted taking dozens of Spy photos of conference participants. Twardoch, a contributor to the just-published book, Learn FontLab Fast, a purported &quot;underground typoterrorism manifesto,&quot; was apprehended in 1989 attempting to board a plane with a kielbasa hidden in his shoe.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Attendees at this year's TypeCon were shocked and dismayed to learn that Yarmola and Twardoch would not be attending. &quot;We saw them as valuable members of our type community and little suspected that they had the insidious intention of destroying our American way of type.&quot; said Franklin Helvetica a decent, American typographer. &quot;I am sure,&quot; said Clarendon Baskerville, &quot;that this development will give an edge to this year's ATypI type conference in Prague, where an increasingly regressive and draconian justice system such as ours does not exist.&quot;</div>
