    body: "Usually, do you calculate stuff? Or go by intuition / eye? Both?\r\n\r\nI
      always felt the urge to calculate stuff, like, the mark should be the x-height
      of the logotype time two or three or whatever. The descriptor should be 50%,
      75% of the logotype or whatever.\r\nLately I'm questioning my compulsiveness,
      so I'm qurious about other ways.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I look at other logotypes to see what options look good in general - like,
    the mark being big, very big, caps-height, x-height, something in the middle,
    sitting on the baseline, above or below it, to the left, to the right, above the
    text, below it, have a separator line, have an enclosure, etc. \r\n\r\nThen try
    it on the actual mark and type, see what works the best, then tweak by the eye.
    In a lot of cases the ideal composition doesn't quantify neatly, it'll be off
    by percentages here and there."

  body: "I usually start of with calculation. Usually in golden ratio -related factor
    as I'm a fan of it. But this factor may vary vastly because it all depends on
    type vs. symbol weight and their relation, priority and prominence.\r\n\r\nWhen
    factor is determined I put them both together and the use optical fine-tuning
    of both to make it work. This is mainly relevant to those logotypes where symbol
    and type are somehow aligned: vertical/horizontal centre/bottom/top. Because there
    may as well be unaligned logotypes although rarely seen."
