body: I am currently going through all the unorganized free fonts I&#39;ve collected
  over the years, and have found that font doctor is great for this weeding out of
  the bad fonts and organizing the good ones, but...There is a setting in font doctor
  that creates a new suitcase file for the fonts. Should I select this or just ingnore
  it and let it organize fonts? I get what it does, but has anyone tested this to
  see if its better to leave them, or to let font doctor do its thing. By the way
  this if for OSX. <BR> <BR>oh and its my first post here. hello!

  body: I found that the best thing that works for me is experimenting with all of
    the settings. That said, one setting that I do use is allowing Font Doctor to
    create a new suitcase.

  body: thank you, I like how it organizes the fonts when you create a new suitcase
    better. But I am so new to font management and was worried that it would negatively
    effect the font
