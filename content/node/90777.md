body: For academic textbooks, is there a "rule of thumb" in regards to the color of
  the text typography? We have a client that is requesting gray (70% black) text.
  We see that as being counter-productive and want to go 100% black. Thoughts?

  body: "Graphic designers sometimes use gray for short lengths of text, but I'd hesitate
    to use it for text that's lengthy (like a textbook) or text that's in a small
    point size.\r\n\r\nIf you're using gray for text you'll get best results using
    gray ink, rather than a screen tint of black. Also make sure that it's light enough
    that it looks like it's deliberately gray, rather than looking like a black that
    didn't print well.\r\n"

  body: What James said. Also, 100% black will most likely print as dark grey anyway.

    norm once in a while, even if it is for an academic textbook. Students might even
    more inclined to read more that way.\r\n"
