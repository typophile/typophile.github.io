  clients. This example is for a fellow artist who goes by the pseudonym \"Ming.\"\r\n\r\nI
  started with the typeface Info, and then went from there. The one on the left has
  minor tweaks to the typeface itself, and the one on the right has added angles instead
  of curves.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on which looks better? Feedback on the overall design,
  in general?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ming_4748.png]"

  body: "Even after reading your post, I initially read m-i-n-j. Without the provided
    info, it could just be read as m-i-j. Separating the 'm' from the 'n' will most
    certainly help this concept if you intend to continue with it.\r\nDo be aware
    that in the UK, reading as minj could give the design certain distracting connotations.
    The word 'minge' over here is a slang word for (how do I put this tastefully?)
    a ladies special place.\r\n\r\nThat aside, I'm definitely more drawn to the first
    one. The curves and circular tittle make it much more approachable.\r\nAs you're
    simulating a real brief, it might be best to delve a little deeper into what Ming
    is all about. What style of artwork does he/she produce? Is it a graphic style
    or more of a fine art style? The more you know about the client, the more you
    can suit the design to them."

  body: "I was worried it could be construed as \"minge\" when I started. Do you have
    any suggestions for how to make it look more like the tail of a g than a j? Here
    is a sample of the tail changed to that of a g. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ming_5259.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    my mind, I think that sharper curve of the tail looks odd when compared to the
    shoulder of the m. What do you think?"

  body: "I don't read it as Ming, but it could certainly be used as a logo that relates
    visually to her name but doesn't literally spell it out.\r\n\r\nRegarding the
    dot over the i, you might try a square one with radius corners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That's what I was going for, James. Not necessarily a literal m-i-n-g, but
    a logo that would be indicative of the name. \r\n\r\nI like your suggestion about
    the rounded square for the tittle. I'll have to sketch up a version like that.
    \r\n\r\nDo you have a preference as to the tail? I think that is what is giving
    me the most trouble right now."

  body: 'Hmmm, I wouldn''t say Plessey''s logo is totally abstract. To me, it is quite
    clearly a typographical device that spells "Plessey" using the visual style of
    an oscilloscope trace, even adhering to the fact that an oscilloscope trace cannot
    go ''backwards'' (as it is a timebase). '

    it's not as open, but still keep it disconnected.
