  help me to identify this font? \r\nI suspected it to be part of the Scriptorium
  collection, as many other fonts in the book, but I could not find its equivalent
  there.\r\nMore samples at pag.128 of this link \r\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/117655597/Planescape-D-D-2nd-In-the-Cage-A-Guide-to-Sigil-OCR\r\nThanks
  in advance!"
