  quite some time now.. and i finally decided it was time to jump aboard!\r\n\r\nim
  Roelant van der Munnik, born and raised in Alkmaar, the Netherlands.. you can read
  the rest in my bio i guess.. \r\n\r\nI have no real formal training in graphic design,
  or typography. Everything i do, is self initiated, and 'selfthaught'.. (you simply
  cannot learn yourself everything, hence typophile and the likes, i guess!)\r\n\r\nIve
  really been liking the scriptwriting/handwriting stuff. Ive been doing this for
  little over a year now i guess, i finally i have some result worth showing.. my
  very first try's were incredibly horrible, but i have consciously seen myself evolve
  to where i am now, and i firmly believe that practice make perfect.. I am nowhere
  near where i want to be, but i guess im along the way.. \r\n\r\nI really admire
  the work of John Stevens, Mark Simonson et al. and im trying my hand at digitizing
  my files, but i guess i need to find some better pens to ink the scripts.\r\n\r\nanyways,
  heres some stuff ive been working on.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2001.jpg]\r\n\r\ngreat

  in photoshop.. the line work was horrible.. :S\r\n\r\n\r\nanyway, \r\ng'day!\r\n"

  body: I love them all. You have a good eye, and think you should continue to develop
    your skills. I'd love to see more when you do them. Thanks for posting. As I think
    about it, it seems more akin to illustration, but could probably apply to making
    fonts somehow or other.

  body: "thanks for the replys, \r\n\r\nit is indeed boroughs.. now that i look at
    it, the 's' definitely looks like an 8!\r\n\r\nthe texture is done in photoshop
    using the bevel and some other options in there..\r\n\r\ni assumed this was the
    forum for posting lettering as well.. my bad.. \r\n\r\ni dont really have the
    intent to create a typeface from any of these renderings, or future script renderings.
    im really kind of into the lettering stuff..\r\n\r\nthanks again!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Why don't you try to digitalize them or one of them in Illustrator. These
    would definitely look very nice when vectored.
