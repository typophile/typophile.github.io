body: "Hi all. Just wanted to throw this up and get some opinions. Originally this
  was headed for the \"display\" forum but I've worked with it to the point where
  I think it could be more of a functional serif text face. Albeit in a limited role.
  And for people who want cutesy, swooshy text. Anyways... fire away!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/reverie1_6475.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/reverie3_4599.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/reverie2_4644.png]"

  body: Nice start. Your 'Ww's are heavy in bottom middle. Consider thinning stroke
    there.

  body: "I agree this is a good start.\r\n\r\nI think a rounder, less eccentric tittle
    shape would fit the typeface better.\r\nSome of the pointy terminals on the figures
    feel out of place.\r\nThe break from straight into curve in letters like B/P/R
    looks a bit mechanical to me.\r\nLooks like you need increase overshoot for some
    terminals: notice for example how the last, curved stroke bottom of m/n looks
    a bit like it's riding high relative to the straight-cut strokes to its left.\r\n\r\nWorks
    better at that small size than I would have guessed!"

  body: "Sweet!\r\nThe numerals just caught my eye \u2013 maybe I'm missing something,
    but I'd say if your \"3\" stands, your \"5\" should probably do the same. The
    more common way would be to let the \"3\" hang, like the \"5\". (See <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/3912153709/\">this</a>
    for instance, for a juxtaposition of old-style and modern models.)"

  body: 'Good points everyone. Thanks. I''m seeing a whole bunch of things that I
    have to alter. I think I''ll hang that 3.  eliason: Could you clarify what you
    mean by making the title shapes rounder and less eccentric at the same time? I''ve
    been wondering if this face should have a more standard upper case, but create
    an alternate "swash" version. Something art-deco-ish. '

    between swashiness and simplicity.
