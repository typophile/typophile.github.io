body: "Situation: In summer 2007 I contacted a wellknown typedesigner to finish a
  font (a sans serif - medium weigth) that I had started designing in fontlab - the
  task was to finished the fontset (missing characters, kerning etc) and expand it
  to a light and bold version + italics (slanted)- at the time of agrement the guy
  was broke so I paid upfront so he didn't had to worry about the rent. We agreed
  on a deadline october 2008 - final work.\r\n\r\nIn the months that followed I asked
  for material - to see how things was going but was told \"im doing this for another
  client - very busy - bla bla\" and time went - no font. Come summer 2008 I contacted
  the typedesigner and asked if we could make it for october deadline and suddenly
  I had to do some stuff myself- He said as he was not the designer and therefor would
  not design the missing charcters (we are talking east europe characters)?! - so
  I did the characters that I was asked to do in a few days (not to delay the process)
  - now december and I have just recieved a medium version that i will consider 90%
  done designwise (missing characters, optical adjustments)but no kerning and other
  technical stuff plus some of the things I requested had been totally ignored. \r\n\r\nSo
  we went from having a good relationship to really none - and I dont' know what I
  am getting or when (if ever) -  Or what I did since the guy didn't produce as agreed.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I need is a good advice how to get the job done - A solution that i thought of is
  to get him to finish off the medium version and get somebody else to do the rest
  (the light and the bold) !? But with my luck I have no idea who to contact, so I
  can get the font done in the other weigths.\r\n\r\nBasically I need somebody to
  proof check the work and somebody (maybe same person) to produce the other weigths.\r\n\r\nThe
  price he set and that we agreed on was 9000 \u20AC \r\n\r\nPlease note that the
  payment and price has been according to his charge - and I even gave an extra 1000
  \u20AC this summer to speed up the process.\r\n\r\nI have talked with a laywer -
  but they really don't understand the situation and a laywer in my opinion is something
  that will only cost money not produce a font.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions is highly appriciated
  - and please don't ask for a name - I don't want to badmouth anybody.\r\n\r\nregards\r\nLukes\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, for starters, this can be a cautionary tale for others: it's a bad
    idea to pay completely up front for work like this. Instead, it can be done based
    on agreed-upon milestones in the development. Plus, if you're going to be giving
    somebody nine thousand euro (or ten thousand in the end), it is actually worth
    putting a contract in place. Not that this all helps you any now, of course, for
    which I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nFirst, did you have communication by email or in writing
    such that you have a written record of what was agreed to?\r\n\r\nSecond, decide
    on what if anything you want from the existing type designer. Do you want him
    to do any more work? Do you want some or most of your money back? If there's stuff
    you want, you could ask him to agree to arbitration (another element that one
    could have put in a contract, if you had one), and get somebody knowledgeable
    and respected in the community, who you both agree upon, to be the arbitrator.
    The alternative would be to pursue him legally, but you seem uninterested in that,
    and as you say, that is a good way to make sure that lawyers make money rather
    than either you or the type designer.\r\n\r\nI expect that many of the folks here
    would be interested in doing the finishing work for you. as well.\r\n\r\nBoth
    of these roles sound interesting to me, actually, though it would probably be
    a conflict of interest to have one person do both.\r\n\r\nGood luck with all this.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    it! Then you end the cooperation immedietly with this person. I am sure you can
    find someone else to do the work better and faster. Just have a look in the list
    of foundries and designers at the Typowiki here on typophile and contact the persons
    you think could fit the job by looking at their websites and contacting them etc.\r\nHope
    you get it sorted out."

  body: "The price you agreed to was fair, if a bit low for the work.\r\n\r\nThe length
    of time for this project (more than a year) seems really suspicious to me. Generally
    it should take a professional no more than two weeks to create a new weight from
    an existing design. Two weeks for the light and  two weeks for the heavy. Adding
    the additional Central European characters should be a fairly simple task. The
    kerning for the three fonts can be done in a week, and the slanted italics can
    be done in no time (if you just want digital obliques). \r\n\r\nThis is really
    routine work. It should have been completed in five or six weeks at the most.
    We have been doing this sort of thing for designers and art directors since 1990."

    But that being said, I agree wholeheartedly that there's no reason this should
    have taken more than a couple of months of actual working time, for decent quality
    work.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    all, that's the name of the game. Contracting out font production work is no sure
    thing. \r\n\r\nIt was foolish of you to pay such a large sum up front before you
    found someone you clicked with.\r\n\r\nType design and font production--don't
    always overlap.\r\n\r\nIf it's any consolation, things move slowly in the font
    biz."

    should have raised alarm bells right away. Well known and broke - seems like a
    recipe for disaster. \r\n\r\n>I have talked with a laywer -\r\n\r\nDo you have
    a written contract with the designer? I would have thought that a contract outlining
    the work, especially the missing characters, would be pretty black & white, legally
    speaking.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well first, since my first post I have talked with a lawyer (again) and he
    said was a good idea to get experts opinion on the subject before we take any
    legal action - so thanks for for current and future feedback.\r\n\r\nI have to
    mention that I have known the typedesigner for more than 7 years and have used
    him for several smaller type related projects (fixing characters in custom logotypes
    ) with no problems on quality and he delivered on time.\r\n\r\nAlso I did consider
    him as a friend as we have had many social meetings over the years - and lots
    of conversations outside the field of typedesign - what Im saying is that it was
    not always talks about fonts and business. The reason for his economic situation
    was more because of some bad investments and family issues ...\r\n\r\nRegarding
    contract we have verbal agreement (which by european law is just as legal as  written
    and which has numerous times been confirmed in email) so there should be no confusion
    about the task \"in a legal sense\"- except maybe for date of delivery - which
    has been agreed on to be november 2008  since the beginning - which the lawyer
    considered to be a little to loose - but since we already past november now that
    doesn't really matter.\r\n\r\nI have contacted the typedesigner by email and made
    it clear that this current situation is unacceptable - and if he wish to \"continue\",
    a written contract has to be made with specific deadlines (within near future).
    An alternative is that he pays for the finishing of the font by somebody else.\r\n\r\nAgain
    - thanks for the input.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "James, if the work wasn't really done, 9000 Euro is not\r\na fair price at
    all! It's a lot of money, especially these days.\r\nThat said, paying up front
    was not smart at all, no matter\r\nwho you're dealing with; it becomes too tempting
    to sit on\r\nyour hands, or at least stall stall stall.\r\n\r\nI suggest that
    if you're at your wits' end you need to start\r\nplaying hardball. For example
    tell him you will reveal\r\nhis identity on Typophile. If he refuses to do the
    work\r\nthen agree on a way for him to repay you part of the fee.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
