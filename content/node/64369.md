  What types of things do you try to mimic, and has anything crashed and burned terribly? "

    of sixteenth century writing master Jodocus Hondius. Of course that only made
    it less legible, but whatever.

    typographically originated with the hand written form. Ah history, it is a wonderful

  body: "Of course it's lettering. But the special thing about \"faux type\" is its
    intent: looking like type, not simply being some personal, spontaneous expression.
    And because of that it's not \"painterly\", it's... \"builderly\"? It's more thoughtful
    than emotional. To me that's appealing, refreshing and useful.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
