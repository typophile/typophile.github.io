  body: "Joanna is a great looking typeface, and one of the most original serifs produced
    in XX century typography, but I doubt that, as often happens, its digital rendition
    can reach the true spirit of the original metal. It is already been stressed by
    someone else in this forum, but a great contemporary and very well-working typeface
    which somehow resembles the shapes of Joanna (without the idiosyncracies and faults
    of the digital version) is Whitman by Kent Lew, a font which I've used in setting
    books and that I find particulary helpful in running text and even in covers,
    when set at big sizes.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kentlew.com/WhitmanOverview.html\r\n\r\nAnd
    speaking of typeface for books: I'm currently using Cycles, by Sumner Stone, one
    of the few successful achievement in digital typography in recent years. Apart
    from being so nicely executed and drawned, Cycles is available in various sizes,
    from 5 to 36, so it is very helpful for \"complex book typography\", when you
    need the right font weight for the main text, the titles, the footnotes, etc.
    Once you'll start using Cycles, you'll forget most of the serifs you've used before.\r\n\r\nhttp://stonetypefoundry.com/cyclesoverview.html"

    has a very good contrast, the serifs are very elegant and the colour is very well.\r\n\r\n...
    \"but I doubt that, as often happens, its digital rendition can reach the true
    spirit of the original metal\" ncaleffi you are right! \r\n\r\n"
