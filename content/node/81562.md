body: "Hi,\r\nI am having an anoying problem generating an opentype font in fontlab:\r\nAfter
  merging contours and generating the otf-file, my font looks fine in the preview
  and in fontexplorer, but when I want to use it e.g. in indesign or illustrator,
  some of the contours are distorted (in Textedit it works alright though). When I
  create outlines, all the contours look fine again. \r\nsee in the picture how it
  should be and how some letters are rendered.\r\n\r\nthis happened in two completely
  different fonts I drew.\r\nI am using font nuke, so it does not seem to be a cache
  problem.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an idea why this happens?\r\n\r\nChristine\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/errors_4488.jpg]"

    had any effect?\r\n\r\nDid you try with and without hinting?"

  body: "Hi Christine! :)\r\n\r\nDo you have huge alignment zones in your font? Try
    getting rid of them for now. Also, hints (as Nick said) could be a problem."

  body: "Cool, it works now! I got rid of the autohinting as well as the alignment
    zones.\r\n(I never tried postscript and truetype, but exported it to the woff
    format, there were no problems).\r\n\r\nthank you! "

  body: "Nevertheless your font looks like it would be easy to hint it. There seems
    to be something wrong with the rounded corners. Maybe the pathes have to be cleaned
    up there. And if the hinting causes this terrible effect even in such a big point
    size, I would also check the blue values. And maybe you have to add some ghost
    hints.\r\n\r\nMore about PS hinting, alignment zones, ghost hints and so on: http://typophile.com/files/hinting.pdf\r\n"
