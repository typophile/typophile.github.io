		<div class="commentbody">There are very courage and good reflection to create this typography with a very perticular apperence and idea. Like Hrant said to distribut to America I think that the rest of the world would like to use to express better the day of 11 of september and reallity of WAR. I like very must of the capitals than lowercase letters because the structure of the letters are more irregular and show better the felling of the catastrophe. The lowercase fell's me that have a repetive and regular apperence ( tratemant ). Gerald good work and good luck to distribute this honest typography to every one.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hello Jared! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Me too I am as dubious as you are. I don't know why your opinion and your comments &quot;wake the Devil in me&quot;! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since the first time I saw the rubble at Ground Zero I got the idea to make a type with these tortured structures. A few days later, it was announced that a part of the structures will be preserved to make a memorial at WTC site. This is what decided me to start working on this design. Life isn't a garden of roses and artists (which I think I am not!) have to react their way to catastrophes or tragic events or to beautiful and nobles actions as well. &quot;Infamy&quot; is my way to react. I am not as famous and as smart as Picasso (I suppose you know that!!!) but remember Guernica. Do you think this masterpiece is somewhat &quot;morbid&quot;? I don't think it is. It is a angry shout against horror and human cruelty. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I decided to make a typeface (which is conceived to be a long lasting object) because of the iconic nature of the rubble. And also because I am not convinced your fellow citizens really want to sooth their wounds when I watch 24/7 CNN Breaking News or when I listen to interviews of ordinary people or politicians (of both sides) or when I read Time magazine or The New York Times or the Enquirer (sic!). I am not convinced too when I heard about the WTC Memorial which will integrate wreckage of the Twin Towers (with a &quot;cross&quot; made from the structure!!!, just enough to start a religious war!!!).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am sure that people will use this font in the future for titles which need to refer to a symbol of human cruelty. And if they won't, it will be too bad for me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, thank you for revealing your position in such a polite way. And I can say that I completely share your opinion about the September 11 font. I already knew this font and you know what? I found it much more morbid than mine and particularly the sample you posted! Just because it shows the action instead of showing the horrible result. Some design my peers made show a complete lack of decency. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Warmest regards</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow&hellip; What an interesting thread this is shaping up to be. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I completely agree with what has been said about both the September 11 font and this one. They are evocative of very unsettling reactions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps where we differ is that I see this uncomfortable reaction as an eminently good thing; indeed, I believe that reaction to be exactly the point of both of these fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The events of September 11 were, without question, some of the most abhorrent, tragic, morbid and heart-rending events I have witnessed in my lifetime. In fact, the day could easily be argued to have been the most significant world event in my lifetime. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As such, while it is certainly necessary to heal from the pain the events inflicted, it is also necessary to recognize the significance of the scars they have left behind. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Like the Nazi Holocaust, Jonestown, and countless other tragedies, little service is paid to their memories by finding only comfortable ways to remember them. Indeed, no service is done to their memory by allowing ourselves to forget or gloss over the pain they have caused. Of course there is a fine line between morbidity and boldly/proudly displaying the scars of our experience; but I do not think that efforts such as these two designs even approach such a line, and I hold that opinion completely apart from the fact that proceeds from the sale of the fonts will be donated to charities dealing with the disaster. It should be remembered that if it hadn't been for the horrific images seen on the broadcast and print news, those of us who weren't there to experience it firsthand really wouldn't have had the same sense of the depth and scope of what really happened. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is it uncomfortable to be reminded of the images of the occupied planes slicing into inhabited buildings, or the images of terrified people jumping hopelessly from windows a hundred floors off the ground, or the images of those still-occupied buildings crumpling into twisted, grinding, smouldering piles of debris? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It is excruciating. And it should be. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Art, including in this sense typographic design, should be provocative (or evocative) when it wishes to be, and I believe that both of these fonts have achieved that goal, among others, in their own ways; &quot;Infamy,&quot; as an evocative functional display font, and &quot;September 11,&quot; as (at least) an evocative exercise in typographic expression. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Responses are welcomed and encouraged, as always. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">High five. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the more recent version. I'm not sure that a type-face is the right way to express whatever needs to be expressed, but the second version, with the tattered characters, is definitely more expressive. I would tear it apart a lot more. the shapes of the trade towers columns are compelling, but the shapes of the letters are so clean and nice, it doesn't work. It feels wrong. If I were to use this face it would be silk-screened, or rubber stamped then torn to peices.
