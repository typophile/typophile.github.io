body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nFor a logo, I'm looking for a serif typeface where the terminal
  of the capital J and the upper serif on the capital S are identical (or nearly so).
  I've found Copperplate and Della Robbia; any others? Many thanks for any leads."

  body: "Thank you, Nick! I was secretly hoping to find an \"S\" with a ball terminal,
    so Archer might fit the bill.\r\n\r\nInterested in any other suggestions if they
    arise, as well!"
