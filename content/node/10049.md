  body: ok, how do you recreate the font then? I&#39;ve tried typesetting a serif
    font, saving the file, deleting the font from the HD to make it try and substitute
    the font with the &#34;Adobe Serif Sub font&#34;, but it keeps replacing the font
    with times. How do I typeset with the Substitution font?

  body: Read my explanation at the bottom of my rant thread - it&#39;s all  <BR>pretty
    erratic. Furthermore, why on earth should you try to  <BR>emulate something that
    obviously is a production error? <BR> <BR><b>11th Commandment</b> - Thou shalt
    not try to recreate a setting of  <BR>the unholy Adobe Serife, as it is the work
    of lesser typographers.

  body: The sad part is somewhere along the line this happened and everyone is convinced
    this is the correct logo. The only copy on hand is some bad jpeg which must be
    vectorized. Correct or not, it&#39;s what they want - sigh.
