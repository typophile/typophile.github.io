  like to see what do you guys think. Positive or Negative  are welcome. hah I don't
  care. This is my brand name that I registered last year. I was thinking of redesigning
  the logo, but I need to see which one you would tell me to go for.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logos_3735.jpg]"

    of them. The left logotypes were the only ones I was able to read correctly. The
    Symbols didn't read well either. \r\n\r\nSeems like more time is being spent with
    odd fonts then an overall composition."

  body: "I had the same impression as picard102 regarding odd fonts. \r\n\r\nIf the
    word \"basic\" is a root of the name, work with that. Make things more basic...simpler.
    I'd work from the first pair. The rest aren't doing anything for me. \r\n\r\nI'd
    suggest a less stylized face for \"one\" in the wordmark and maybe give it a little
    more room. The symbol version would be more solid with out the \"one\" element
    entirely."

  body: "There's a little too much going on in every single one of your logos IMHO.
    If I had to choose one, I'd go for the horizontal lettermark under \"Original
    Logo TM 2007\", because it's the only one I can read. The others are barely readable
    to me. If you add colour, this effect will become even more disturbing.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Web

  body: "@ picard. The symbols represents \"B6 - one\" . Yes your right, I spent lots
    of time on these. But thanks for your critiques.\r\n\r\n@dropkick: The word basic
    is too generic.. and plus I can't have that name. There are tons of basic(s) brand
    name out there.. So therefore I did \"basix one\".\r\n\r\n@Tintin81: True. I guess
    I need retune the logos. thanks for the critiques.\r\n \r\n@Dan Weaver: To answer
    your question. I do Graphic T-shirts. Streetwear brand. "

    like to be creative. This is going to be my street clothing brand name.  So I
    basically create tweak fonts.  Anyway.. I''m going to stick to my 3rd concept
    letter-mark. Which represents strong and bold. '

    a sentence. \"make sure learn how\"?\r\n\r\nAs for the logos I prefer the original
    letter mark but instead of the \"one\" written like that how about a nice bold
    1 instead? I do agree there's a reason to use some more edgy designs in this case
    but within reason of course."

    always wanted to collect. But then I can only pick the best one and put it to
    use. My original letter mark is Trademark.  So therefore, I'm thinking of using
    something better. More simpler bolder feel and sleeker look. Heres one. Let me
    know what you think.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/basixoneclothinglogo_4601.png]"

    in a vehicle license plate outline. Using the number "6", but writing out the
    number (1) one. Best of luck on your brand symbol and venture.
