		<div class="commentbody">Sorry, I meant the US ID, and not the european ID or I-D. And the more I look at it, the more I think the US ID. The cover is using much the same device of the content listing on the right with rules under each item. Same goes for the use of white space and rules in the interior shot. Again, if memory serves, the two magazines have the same publisher, so perhaps we are seeing the beginning of a merging between the two, as ID is about industrial design, though it has often covered graphic design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">i most definitely cannot deny the fact this redesign is very nice. in the few times i've picked up older issues of print (including the one i borrowed from our little library today) it's easy to see this is much more clean and readable. eye-friendly. BUT, putting the fact aside that this is a change and improvement on something that already existed, i'm curious to know why, if this magazine made it's debut today, why we'd like it's design. unfortunately, i'm coming off as dense and uneducated which i regret to do, but i'm more curious as to what designers think about good page layout and design. like what makes those things click in our heads while the pieces fall together. as i work with a magazine currently doing design and layout i feel i can never learn enough, and it was the one subject of design education that always seemed to elude me, sort of like long division in 3rd grade. being able to design in the short term with the long term always in mind, and it always left me feeling like i was missing something. <BR> <BR>so if anyone would like to explain in depth the reasons for the enjoyment of this redesign, i, and hopefully others, would find it very informative. comparing the old to the new, or just stating reasons as to why you like or dislike what is happening within those pages. <BR> <BR>cheers to always feeling like you know nothing but can learn everything! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've got to admit the redesigned issue of Print is one of the first I've actually paid attention to in quite some time.  When recent past issues arrived, I'd quickly flip through them and immediate make the decision that the text heavy articles made my brain hurt and I'd set the magazine aside for possible read later.  The new design caught my attention.  I actually sat down and started reading it as soon as I ripped it out of it's plastic mailing bag.  It seems that pentagram has put some new life into what was becoming a stale publication for me. <BR> <BR>The other F+W design publication, HOW, also got a going over by pentagram and I think the redesign is refreshing and gives the editors/art directors a lot more flexibility in presenting text and images.  I suppose, in the interest of &quot;full disclosure&quot; I should acknowledge that I am a member of HOW's Editorial Advisory Board - and it was interesting to be included in sneak peaks of the new design in process. <BR> <BR>Did ID get a redesign as well? <BR> <BR>- Jeff <BR> <BR>::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::  :: <BR> <BR>Jeff Fisher :: Engineer of Creative Identity <BR>Jeff Fisher LogoMotives <BR><a href="http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com">http://www.jfisherlogomotives.com</a></a> <BR> <BR>::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::  :: <BR> <BR>HOW Magazine Editorial Advisory Board :: 2005 HOW Conference Advisory Board <BR> <BR>Speaker: &quot;Tooting Your Own Horn&quot; :: 2005 HOW Design Conference :: Chicago <BR> <BR>Author: &quot;The Savvy Designer's Guide to  Success&quot; from HOW Design Books.  <BR> <BR> <BR>::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::  ::</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interestingly, I don't care too much for the new Print logo redesign. While the typeface warmly reflects handprinting reminiscent of early years in elementary school, it is overall sterile and plain. As some of you have touched on, I think the magazine is becoming uniformly &quot;sexless&quot; and &quot;unappealing&quot; like so many others trying to increase its readership through formal conservatism. Whatever happened to design based on &quot;personality&quot; and &quot;character&quot;? A typeface can convey, conjure, and evoke emotional content as well as communicate at the same time. <BR> <BR>I feel the use of H&amp;FJ's Gotham Rounded gets lost in the cover, amist the photography or illustration, thus becoming difficult to read from a browsing distance. Also, the visual weight, both due to spacing and density of the letters &quot;print&quot; are too weak in my opinion. I also find it interesting that the color is yellow since it's commonly known that it's the first color to become indistinguishable for a male color blind person. <BR> <BR>I must admit that the new design is an improvement. I just think it could go even further.</div>
