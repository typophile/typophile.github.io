    size text?"

    10-19pt\r\n& for print 12pt and above. I have never set text in Didone fonts so
    your suggestions are more than welcome."

  body: "That's tricky. Flash has its own way of rendering fonts, so without having
    seen the way different Bodonis are interpreted by it, it's hard to make a recommendation.\r\n\r\nIn
    print, I've used Bauer Bodoni, ITC 72/12/6, and Berthold Bodoni. I would recommend
    Bauer Bodoni at 12 pt and above, it's very smart and elegant."

  body: 'You''d want something that doesn''t rely on Opentype to do the job. (Or did
    the latest version get OT support?) Many foundries doesn''t allow dynamic text
    fields, so read those carefully. As for the rendering: you can adjust sharpness
    and weight as you please, but neither are very precise.'

  body: Hi Frank, what's wrong with Opentype? I thought fonts in Opentype are the
    best that one could get nowadays. I'd like to learn more on that:).
