  was either projected or displayed on a screen on(to) the stage. Because it's a video,
  it's a bit blurry, with some of the corners becoming a little ambiguous, but I figured
  there are a lot of people here with sharp eyes who could help.\r\n\r\nAgain, apologies
  for the blurriness. I searched all over for a direct feed of some sort, but to no
  avail. I attempted to run it through an Unsharp Mask filter, but since again, recording
  itself merged some non-contiguous parts (like the S), since it was from a good distance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ngmlsplit_6112.jpg]\r\nThanks
  for any help!"

  body: "Ah, thanks so much. Ironically, I actually have Poplar on my system, but
    that artificial expansion put it beyond recognition. And admittedly, I don't use
    Poplar enough (rather, I've never used it) to know its features.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!"
