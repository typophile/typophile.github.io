  body: Apparently Kelsey doesn't know either one. So what's the point of his post?
    Or is this a tease?

  body: "The point of my post wasn't meant to indicate that I knew the font but to
    clarify for others which font needs to be identified. Some people may decide to
    look into finding out the font but they should know which one they are identifying.
    That way they don't waste their time on a font that doesn't need to be identified.\r\n\r\nJust
    quick looking at the sans serif it looks to me like Helvetica. There are many
    similar fonts so to be 100% confident all of the characters would need to be compared.
    If that is the font that needed to be identified I would have given an answer
    because I recognized it off the top of my head. If I knew it was the other font
    that needed to be identified I would probably move on to the next post. I'm not
    very good with serif fonts so I don't know what it is. I would have to spend some
    time looking into fonts with just a slight chance that I could even figure it
    out. A lot of logos are often times custom lettered or an obscure font so it can
    be a wild goose chase if you don't know the font right away. I don't think it
    is custom in this case."
