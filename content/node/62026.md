  us to create a logo for their Conference in the Tampa Bay area. She was looking
  for a logo that represented \"old Florida\" and it needed to have a dolphin. I created
  the typeface to add to the Art Deco theme. This is what I submitted\u2014 I would
  like to maybe keep workin on it. I'm still unsure if I should have made an 'O' based
  off the 'A'. What about the placement of the dolphin? Any comments would be appreciated.

    in '11. As it will probably be in this post of mine unless the smart-quotes routine
    is very clever.  :)\r\n\r\nWith that much text, I don't think the generous letterspacing
    works so well.\r\n\r\nOther than that, it's not bad.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "For a logo it is very cluttered.\r\nThere is a lot of information which could
    \u2013 i.m.o. - be presented more clearly.\r\nPresent it in digestable bits of
    information instead of some grey.\r\n\r\nI find it too static which doesn't serve
    the mammals right.\r\n\r\nWhy the art deco theme?\r\nWhat is the relationship?\r\n\r\nCould
    you elaborate a bit more on this piece?\r\n\r\nClosing: it is not bad. But there
    is room for improvement.\r\n\r\nLove to see where this is going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: Thanks guys for the feedback! I know its really wordy but it needed all that
    text specifically >_>.  I went thematic because Art Deco is very Floridian. was
    to represent "old Florida." Thanks for the comment about the letterspacing and
    the apostrophe.

  body: "I'd consider a more marine color palette. (Why is the dolphin orange?) Perhaps
    also, create a field of waves similar to what can be done with this font: [[http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/atlantik|Atlantik]]
    (download the specimen). Also, look at the fonts they use with the pattern, I
    think they'll pair better and accomplish the look you want in a slightly more
    updated way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: 'Wow, that''s a mouthful to include in one logo. I would play around with
    different text sizes and hierarchy. Maybe try making the "Biology of Marine Mammals"
    the focus? '

  body: Great ideas, really liking that Atlantik. Good point about size and hierarchy.
    Can't help the wordiness though, it was required.
