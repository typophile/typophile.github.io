  area to catch my attention was the work of Kris Sowersby. I remember his early frustration
  as the work progressed and his joy as it moved to realization. I knew it was in
  him then and I am happy to see it out and about for the rest of the world to see.
  Bravo Kris and thank you Village for having the vision to see what a great contribution
  Kris has made to the type world.\r\n\r\nGo have a look and even a buy at:\r\n\r\n<a

    three years and two weeks. In that time I don't think I have ever posted anything.
    Pathetic.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I know my membership length is because I had
    to go through the password rediscovery rigmarole to write this message.\r\n\r\nWhy?
    The brilliance of Feijoa motivated me: the slackest of typophile readers and wannabe
    designers. It motivated me to post a message saying:\r\n\r\nCongratulations Kris.
    I am pleased to see what I always knew would happen, happen.\r\n\r\nI am also
    mighty thankful that I have been able to work with you since our sh*tty projects
