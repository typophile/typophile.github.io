    to your post. There is a very strict policy against  <BR>illegal font swapping
    on Typophile. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll do  <BR>everything we can to find your

  body: I can&#39;t make out detail in your sample, Finder, but it at least resembles
    an old typeface in the Solotype catalog called Chevalier. The <a href="http://www.qbf.de/tceng.htm"
    target="_blank"> Quick Brown Fox</a> &#40;Brendel Informatik&#41; website offers
    it by this name. <BR> <BR>David Nalle at Scriptorium digitized it a bit differently
    as <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Castel+Sant+Antoni&amp;search%5Btext%5D=marmyadose"
    target="_blank"> Marmyadose</a>.
