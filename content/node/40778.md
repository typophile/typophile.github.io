  body: What version of the Flash Player plugin are you running? Some of the important
    features of this site, including file uploads, depend on Flash. Try updating the
    plugin and see if you get different results.

  body: If you do 'Edit' and then 'attach new file' (selecting it with browse) <em>without</em>
    clicking 'Attach' but just 'Submit', it should work. I don't know why, but that
    works for me. :)
