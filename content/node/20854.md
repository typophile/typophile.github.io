  body: Thanks. Any suggestions what I can do to make this font working better in
    terms of readability? It works fine for me for short words or as a single characters
    but for something longer it is simply annoying.

  body: It will probably never become somthing that is good for more that 4 or five
    words on maybe a slightly longer book title. But you could attempt to make it
    a little easier to read. And a lower case would round it out nicely. However,
    I am having trouble assessing what I think because the rendering of each glyph
    is sort of small. The way you handle the slightly curved portions isn't that clear
    as it is. Can you post a few letters 300% larger? Or post a PDF?

    body: "There is new bigger file attached to first post.\r\nUnfortunatelly you're
      right with the length. Bigger looks better indeed, haven't thought about that
      before. Anyway I have no clear idea for lower case. As I said I have no experience
      on that field so it comes to me quite difficult to imagine possible changes/improvements.\r\nI
      have played with A a little bit, although it does not look as I initially wanted
      to (it all started from letter A) but it looks better I think. "

  body: "Now I can see what happening I do have several things to offer you: take
    them or not.\r\n\r\n I am not sure that I like the 'bitten' quality of some of
    the openings where one shape has been cut from another. Some places like the upper
    end of low tail of the the L seem to benefit from this approach. But the bottom
    of your M it seems like a problem. And I don't know if it helps the opening under
    the A either. \r\n\r\nMaybe instead of making the R so round you should bring
    the arm in. Or cut a bite in the right side. \r\n\r\nI would like to see the Y
    being built out of the forms I see in the D. That vertical width. \r\n\r\nLooking
    at the comma I wonder if it can be at an angle, why not the arm of the R? Or maybe
    the comma should be build up from squares too... \r\n\r\nThis is all to suggest
    that there are many more ways of making these forms & that I want to encourage
    you to keep trying things. I think you might try 3 or 4 more possibilities for
    each letter and look for ways of creating a bit more harmony between them. There
    is always going to be some tension in a font like this between the 'rules' you
    have set for yourself to build the font & the needs of the eye. When in doubt
    - go with the eye.\r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\n"
