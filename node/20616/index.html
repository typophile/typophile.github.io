		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Brad and Suntory. I just read through the thread. But it mainly talks about the 0 on a typedesign level. I once read somewhere that It had a somewhat more political or historical reason for it&rsquo;s non-design, not only to diffrentiate from the o. Like the 0 was often regarded as a non-character maybe as a reference to its mathematical meaning of &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;? Math-history sais the ancestor of the 0 was originally introduced in India only as a placeholder in shape of a period or later a circle. Apparently the Church even banned the character when it was introduced later in India-Arabic Mathematics. I&rsquo;m interested how that affected typedesigners?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The zero played a special role when Arabic numerals were introduced into western writing. It was only its use as a place holder within a positional system that made modern arithmetics possible. Leonardo di Pisa (also known as Fibonacci) introduced the concept of zero and numerals in his &lsquo;Liber abaci&rsquo; in 1202 as follows:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The nine Indian figures are the following: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. This is why with these nine figures and the sign 0, called zephirum in Arabic, all the numbers you may wish can be written.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leonardo uses the word &lsquo;zephirum&rsquo;, which later became the word zero, and he clearly distinguishes between the nine numerals and the zero, a distinction that later found its equivalent in the design of the numerals and the zero in early printing types. The zero in Renaissance typefaces is a perfect circle without any modulation in stroke thickness, thus making its actual form look a little bit different from that of the other numerals.</p>
<p>The shape of the numerals in mediaeval manuscripts were different from our modern numerals. The ‘4’ resembled an ‘8’ with an opened lower bowl, the ‘5’ looked like a contemporary handwritten ‘4’, and the ‘7’ looks like a ‘V’ upside down. (When wou read the caption in Phil Baines and Andrew Haslam: &lsquo;Type and Typography&rsquo; on page 45 you can see how the authors therefore confused the old shape of 5 with 9.) It was only through the renaissance printers that the shape of the numerals as we know them nowadays were established.</p>
<p>For more information about the history of the numbers see:
Georges Ifrah: &lsquo;The universal history of numbers&rsquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The first printed books did not make use of Arabic numerals at all. None of Gutenberg’s printings contain any Arabic numerals. Ratdolt was one of the first to use printed Arabic numerals in his books – many of which were about mathematics and astronomy. His numerals left behind any traces of medieval forms and are immediately familiar to the modern eye. The zero is a perfect circle. Aldus&rsquo;s zero was a perfect circle, as well as the zeros in Garamond&rsquo;s typefaces.</p>
<p>Francois Guyot was one of the first type designer (or was he the first at all?) to cut both a roman and an italic related to each other, evidently with the idea that both may be used together. He used exactly the same numerals for both the roman and the italic typeface (as one can see in the Folger type specimen of c. 1565). His zero is a perfect circle. (BTW, perfect circle actually means perfect circle - the counter in one of Granjon&rsquo;s typefaces was drilled, as one can see in Fred Smeijers: &lsquo;Counterpunch&rsquo;, p 158.)</p>
<p>Ameet Tavernier was the first punchcutter who designed inclined numerals for an italic typeface, but he did not dare to touch the perfect circle shape of the zero, so the zero is upright and not inclined.</p>
<p>Approximately at the same time, Robert Granjon cut his first italic with inclined numerals, but he also slanted the zero, which therefore turned into an oval. It is very interesting to observe that Granjon, even if he abandoned the shape of the perfect circle, retained the other characteristic feature of the zero, its monolinear stroke thickness. He must have found it important to still keep the shape of the zero different, while trying to bring the design of the numerals closer to the design of the italic.</p>
<p>The introduction of numerals of equal width (one of the two features commonly attributed to the so-called ‘tabular figures’ as opposed to the so-called ‘old-style figures’) preceded the new design of numerals of uniform height. Already in 1764, Pierre-Simon Fournier le jeune wrote in his Manuel typographique about numerals of equal width:</p>
<p>‘The figures of the roman have no respective sets, but one uniform one. They are all cast to the thickness of an n-quadrate; that is to say that two of them put side by side make a square of the size of the body.’</p>
<p>The first numerals of equal height were cut by Richard Austin for the founder John Bell in 1788. It was the zero that suffered most from this treatment, since it was both squeezed into a far too narrow horizontal space and stretched to capital height at the same time.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know – It doesn&rsquo;t really bug me (as a reader), but then on the other hand as a designer - even if I really appreciate that there are well made revivals of historical typefaces available - I hardly use them in the end&hellip;</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not only because of the zero.</p>
<p>Somehow I feel that revivals are WRONG. I really love to look at old type specimens, but I am not sure whether I enjoy a - say - Garamond or Caslon in offset printing. 
(Of course, one could ask whether this is not simply a side-effect of knowing too much about type. When I was still in the innocent state of a person who doesn&rsquo;t know and care about type, a person who just loves to read, I read a lot of Garamont, and I never stopped reading because of a badly designed zero.)
I do enjoy Galliard, but for me it doesn&rsquo;t have that much Granjon in it, I rather see the seventies in it.</p>
<p>As for shape of the zero: 
I think John Hudson was right when he pointed out that the strongest argument for a perfect circle zero nowadays is not a design argument but a marketing argument:
&lsquo;The answer in most revivals seems to be to follow the original; after all, the selling point of the design is that it is a revival of something&rsquo;

<p>My feeling about this issue:</p>
<p>The numerals in any case don&rsquo;t follow the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; of upper or lower case. Even when their color is beautifully harmonious with the u &amp; lc, you can pick them out right away on a page. So to me the old style zero doesn&rsquo;t stick out more than the rest of the numerals, provided it is the right weight and slightly modulated&ndash;i.e. not a perfect circle.</p>
<p>As to revivals, first I agree with Wolfgang to the extent that I think the goal of an &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; revival is misguided. But I do think that revivals that attempt to capture what an old face did well, for new technology, is often well worth the effort. For example, Monotype &rsquo;s metal Bembo and Baskerville, among others, were great typefaces.  And among digital revivals, I greatly admire Adobe Garamond, and I suppose the newest Premier is even better though I don&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>I think the truth is that all typefaces are modifications of older faces&ndash;and this applies even to the first printing types, which took the hands of scribes as their starting point. So whether you call it a revival or not is mainly a matter of how close the &lsquo;revival&rsquo; is to an old type, and, as John says, a marketing decision also.</p>
<p>Studying the old, and trying to capture the best of it for today&ndash;I&rsquo;m all for it.</p>

<p>You really have to get into the nitty gritty to see the issue, so here are some numbers:</p>

<p>outside: 442 w  X  441 h

of top horizontal: 51
of bottom horizontal: 54

<p>Georgia old style 0:</p>

<p>![](/images/old-images/old style comparison_3501.jpg)</p>
<p>Screen is not the greatest comparison, but to me A Caslon old style 0 doesn&rsquo;t work as well as A Garamond. But the A Garamond old style 0, with just a touch more contrast and some &lsquo;ovalness&rsquo;, to me is just fine, as good as the Georgia fully stressed 0.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So here are some pictures to illustrate what I wrote yesterday:</p>
<p>This is the first appearance of any numerals in a manuscript in Europe:
Codex Vigilanus, written by a Spanish monk in the year 978</p>
<p>It shows: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 - zero seems to be missing.
2 and 3 are rotated 180 degree.
5 shows the characteristic shape as often seen in manuscripts before its final form as we know it nowadays has been established through printing types.</p>
<p>This attempt in the 10th century to introduce the numerals soon fell into oblivion. It seems as if the monk only reproduced the shapes as seen from the Arabs without understanding the concept behind it.

The numerals are inclined, except perfect circle zero:

<p>Numerals for an italic by Robert Granjon, c. 1554
The zero is also inclined, but still monolinear (without modulation in stroke thickness):

<p>For more info see my comment above.</p>
<p>Now I got a question:</p>
<p>Which punchcutter was the first to cut (Arabic) numerals (not Roman numerals)?
Which printer was the first to use numerals?
Does anyone know?</p>

<p>Hello Bill, tought it&rsquo;s quite small compared even to lowercase letters, I think it&rsquo;s not so much the oldstyle zero of A Caslon that is not as good as in A Garamond or Georgia. Rather, the 6&rsquo;s circle is kept a smaller in Garamond and Georgia, so the zero can stand out a bit more there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Karsten, interesting observation. I note now that also both Garamond&rsquo;s and Georgia&rsquo;s OS number heights are more like &lsquo;small cap&rsquo; height, whereas Adobe Caslon&rsquo;s are x-height. I don&rsquo;t know what factor is more important&ndash;the treatment of the &lsquo;circle&rsquo;, the relationship you point out to 6 &amp; 9 , or the height in relation to the x-height. I&rsquo;ll cast my net wider to look at more old style numerals, do more comparisons, and post the results later.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think both factors are important and prefer small-caps-height oldstyle numerals. In x-height, they appear to be too small (especially if they are spaced a bit more open than lowercase).
I am curious to see your comparisons.</div>
