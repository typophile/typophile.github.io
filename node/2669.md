  <BR> <BR>This is a font I used on a website of mine some time ago. I need it again,
  but it seems it got lost during my last format. Anybody know which font it is? <BR>It
  -probably- is a free one.

    well nota bene&#41;! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Unfortunatly, I can&#39;t find a free copy of
    it anymore. Why is it that fonts that used to be free in the past, suddenly get
    a price tag?

  body: Adriano, it doesn&#39;t matter how fast your computer is &#39;pushing&#39;
    if the pipeline it&#39;s pushing into is too small to handle the flow &#40;from
    a number of directions at once most likely&#41;. <BR> <BR>I like the take-off
    on Poe&#39;s &#34;Raven&#34;, even though the situation isn&#39;t quite the same.

    silly like &#34;If you&#39;re using a 14k modem it won&#39;t help you any...&#34;

    listed</a> on this handy MS Typography page showing <BR>which fonts are bundled

    bundled with CorelDraw and the Corel WordPerfect suite.
