  website (black background, gray and purple colors specific) and the logo is taking
  me forever to finish and get me satisfied.\r\n\r\nI have the draft below, somehow
  the typeface isn't making me feel complete or something.\r\n\r\nany thoughts? an
  alternative typeface?\r\n\r\nmany thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6521.jpg]"

  body: I would try with something a little more angular for the type, something that
    recalls the rounded corners of the camera shape and that maybe could help harmonising
    the "yg" pair.

  body: "The boarding around the C is to close the the C itself. Dont know if this
    is just me, but i get attracted to the eye of the \"lens\" to quick. First i see
    that, then i see the overall view. Mayb you should integrate the photo a bit more.
    Dunno if it works tho :). The yg pair is indeed a bit odd. Maybe create a Y from
    the G. Or create a font that has the same corners as the camera, like riccard0
    said. \r\nHope it helped."
