  ) \r\nbut I'm not happy with the name \"bloobseven\" since a lot of people and clients
  ask me what it stands for.. and it doesn't really stand for anything but is rather
  a \"back-in-the-day-.com-hype\" name.\r\n\r\nSo I've decided to make it more personal
  and switch to my name \"michael nagy\" I've already sketched a few ideas [img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4861.png]
  and after a lil bit of doodling I came up with this idea [img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_6147.png]
  \r\nThe M,N and G form the pencil. MN stands for my name \"Michael Nagy\" and the
  G stands for \"Grafiker\" which is german for graphic designer.\r\nHowever. In the
  cleaned up versions a lot of people read ECO insted of mng. Any ideas on how to
  make it more legible?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3529.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_6216.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  font for the name is Myriad Pro. Is this a good solution in your opinion? I like
  Myriad cause it's versatile and not overused but I'd gladly take any typo suggestions
  into consideration."

    vertically. I'd try something horizontal instead.\r\n\r\nAs for Myriad, I see
    it used everywhere, simply because it's the default typeface in Photoshop and
    Illustrator. It still looks nice though. You might want to either go with a typeface
    closer to the letters you've drawn in the pencil shape, or make the letters in
    the pencil look closer to the typeface used for your name.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "It looks lke ECO also because of the angle. Maybe you should straighten it\r\n\r\nIn
    fact symbol/logotype relation is a little awkward. They don't seem to share the
    same language. If that's your symbol, you should probably try something like Neo
    Sans for the name.\r\n\r\nBut isn't a pencil a rather too obvious solution anyway?
    I much rather preferred the initial typographic options. The last two of the first
    set looked quite stylish."

    problem I've got with a typo only logo is that it might look too simple leading
    the potential client to saying \"why should I hire him if a typo logo is all he
    could come up with\" \r\n\r\nyou know what I mean?"

  body: "\"why should I hire him if a typo logo is all he could come up with...\"\r\n\r\nNot
    really. Most successful design and identity firms have extremely simple, usually
    typographic, logos. You make your statement by the refinement you bring to that
    simplicity - fine typography, exquisite spaces, restrained use of colours...\r\n\r\nIn
    fact a sort of neutrality in your own identity is often a good thing. You're saying
    you don't have a particular style, you can design whatever your client's brief
    requires you to. \r\n      "

    c, I like your handwriting, and it has a nice energy to it.  What do you think
    of the balance between the initials and the text?  I'm wondering if the space
    between the 'n' initial and \"Nagy\" could be negotiated a little better.\r\n\r\nFor
    e, I immediately thought \"a bent paperclip,\" which is really neat.  The paperclip
    is a good concept to work off of, because it's such a banal object, yet at the
    same time you would really notice if it were not designed well!"
