  body: "I fully support open architecture solutions. The arabic font sector is highly
    deficient. However, the Arabic market dynamics don't really encourage developing
    'open' type. I wonder what your marketing plans are.\r\n\r\nYour design is quite
    nice, and I am personally very interested in the Ruq'a style. I think it is the
    ultimate in cursive handwriting. This arises from the exceptional economy in the
    letter forms and the exquisite balance between catenation and separation that
    is inherent in the Arabic script in general.\r\n\r\nRuq'a is also a strong and
    dynamic style that was useful in writing newspaper headlines. In my article [[http://arabictype.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/fonts-harf-jadid|here]],
    I showed how print technology and the development of the Al-Harf Al-Jadeed font
    for the Linotype swept away Ruq'a from the headlines. Solutions like yours might
    lead the way for a Ruq'a comeback.\r\n\r\nPlease do proceed with the development
    of your font, and I hope you will find a solutoin for the InDesign compatibility
    soon.\r\n\r\nKhalid"

    positioning support was only added in CS4.\r\n\r\nDo you have any custom kerning
    defined in the InDesign version? I've found that applying kerning between non-connecting
    Arabic letters will break nearby OpenType cursive attachment.\r\n\r\nIs justification
    turned on? What happens if you alter justification settings?"

    well with the result. Actually, InD does not accept the multiplication of the
    same glyph in different cells but MS products say nothing for this multiplication.\r\n\r\nI
    hope that I can propose the result very soon. :-)"

  body: The Microsoft Arabic shaping engine has the OpenType Layout kern feature on
    by default, so you will always get kerning for Arabic script in any application
    using either Uniscribe or DWrite for layout. OpenType kerning can include contextual
    lookups, which is useful for this kind of Arabic, although the lookups can get
    very numerous if you want to really refine the spacing between lettergroups of
    different shapes.

  body: "@ Badr Oraby, \r\n\r\nIn MirEmad + QalamBartar,  auto kerning is carried
    our for the high frequency lettergroups , but for the low frequency lettergroups
    , you can do manual kerning inside M$ Notepad, Wordpad, Word 2003-2010, IndesignCS5,
    PhotsShop + Illustrator + PagePlus X5 ++\r\nGod willing, both software will be
    available for Mac Users, by the mid of 2012.\r\n\r\nYou can do Auto Kerning as
    mentioned by John Hudson, but that is a fix-one-bug-create-more process, and I
    am afraid you keep answering the Roqa-thirsty fans with Work-in-Progress message,
    even after the Tenth Fourth International Symposium for History of Printing and
    Publishing.\r\n\r\nHoever you can do ONLY Manual Kerning +  ONLY in IndesignCS5?!\r\n\r\nThe
    Choice is yours.\r\n"
