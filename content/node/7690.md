body: 'i haven&#39;t been able to figure this one out: <BR>i have a font i&#39;m working
  with that has three versions of the letter &#39;f&#39; &#40;&#39;f&#39;, &#39;f.salt&#39;
  and &#39;f.salt2&#39;&#41;. there are f-ligs that correspond to two of these glyphs
  &#40;f_i and f_i.salt&#41;. <BR>i want &#39;f i&#39; and &#39;f.salt i&#39; to be
  replaced by f_i and &#39;f.salt2 i&#39; to be substituted by &#39;f_i.salt&#39;
  but i&#39;m not getting something right. i&#39;m thinking that maybe it&#39;s my
  ordering of features??? anyhow what happens is that all combinations are resulting
  in &#39;f_i&#39; and i can&#39;t get &#39;f_i.salt&#39; to work in InD, not even
  when i use the glyph pallet - &#39;f_i.salt&#39;automatically reverts to &#39;f_i&#39;.
  if anyone can help me remedy this problem, i&#39;d appreciate it. thnx for looking.'

    maybe that&#39;s the root of your problem. The &#39;salt&#39; feature is only
    supported by Photoshop CS and Illustrator CS. [Link to <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/OTGuide.pdf">
