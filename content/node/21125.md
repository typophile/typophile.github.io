  body: "The website address - www.fripolisen.no - is set in Envy by Magnus Rakeng,
    published by Thirstype in the mid/late 90s. The type was subsequently taken off
    the market when it was licensed by a publisher for a (now-defunct) music magazine.\r\n\r\nThe
    typeface will probably be re-released by Thirstype some time in 2006 or early
    2007.\r\n\r\nAs for \"silver\"... That appears to be a custom logotype. It is
    not in Magnus's portfolio, so is likely the work of one of many talented Norwegian
    designers."
