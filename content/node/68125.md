  body: I think this is either Trade Gothic or News Gothic. The image is distorted
    a bit, so it's hard to tell exactly which it is. The spacing also looks tighter
    than normal.

  body: Possibly trade gothic, the header being bold condensed No. 20, the way the
    r touches the w is natural, and the body text being light.

  body: That's what I meant by "distortion". Could be something else, I suppose. If
    it is, it definitely takes some cues from Trade Gothic and/or News Gothic.
