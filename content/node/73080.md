  body: "It's not quite Haptic pro, the junction on the 'k' is different. To me it
    looks like Sun by Lucas de Groot. Look at the y in 'Mayer', that's very distinct.
    http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/lucasfonts/sun_regular/ It may be slightly
    softened around the edges in the sign manufacturing process. \r\nLooks like quite
    a smart system, I'd like to know more about it myself. I wonder how that two-tier
    separation works in practice; it looks like the top orange bit has walking times
    on it, the bottom grey bit ... less urgent destinations? "

    does a lot of custom adaptations of his typefaces. '

  body: "For the Typophiles who don\u2019t read Dutch: \r\n\r\nThe top part of the
    pole (that pink thing) denotes the location (the neighbourhood, I guess). The
    set of arrows below that (orange) are the directions to other neighbourhoods in
    Antwerp. And the lower batch of arrows (gray) indicate the main attractions of
    the neighbourhood where the pole is placed.\r\nAnd on certain locations there
    is an extra shield with pertinent info.\r\nThe system is modular to facilitate
    adding extra info and directions.\r\n\r\n(In excerpt, of course)"

    size is comparably small and the images above don't really show how high these
    orange signs are mounted. \r\n\r\nThe maps are also noteworthy: http://www.flickr.com/photos/ralf_herrmann/\r\nUncluttered
    design and color coding, 3D landmarks, neighborhoods clearly visible and so on
    \u2026 :-)"
