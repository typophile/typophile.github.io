  on a pitch, currently using Rockwell as headline fone... want something similar
  but different.\r\nSomething like the font ImageSource use is quite good, but I'd
  rather try something not used my a large company.\r\nwww.imagesource.com\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestion welcome...\r\n\r\nThanks"

    Its a little more like Rockwell, but still different, I think.\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/145635/amasis-family.html"

  body: caecelia is another option... needs careful kerning and line spacing, but
    can be surprisingly readable

  body: If it is the Slab Serif look you want to avoid, you might look into using
    a Clarendon instead. There is a bracket, but you still get the big slab serifs.

  body: "from 'American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century' by Mac McGrew.\r\n\r\n<strong>Rockwell
    Antique</strong> was a reissue of Litho Antique, cut by William Schraubstadter
    for Inland Type Foundry and introduced in 1910, when it was advertised as the
    'newest typeface; one of our best; closely imitating steelplate and lithography.'
    In the late 1920s similar faces became popular in Europe, and some were imported
    into the United States. Morris Benton of ATF added several characters to the old
    Inland face, matrices of which were then in ATF's vaults, and it was reissued
    in 1931 as Rockwell Antique. But Benton saw that something more was needed, and
    redrew it as <strong>Stymie Bold</strong> in the same year. The alternate characters
    which were added to Rockwell are the same ones in Stymie bold.\r\n\r\nMonotype
    copied Rockwell but erroneously called it Stymie Bold in some liturature, and
    there has been confusion between the two faces ever since; the latter name is
    often applied to fonts of Rockwell cast on Monotype machines by secondary suppliers.
