  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Being that it doesn't rain enough over here, and being that said celestial aqua clearly has some impact on quality font development (how else to explain that Adobe and MS live there?) I've decided to take a trip up to Seattle, imminently. Actually my reasons are largely non-typographic, but of course any significant travel calls for the rousing of the local font freaks, so I'm hoping that some of you... Seattlenos are game. I will be free* at least this coming Friday night, probably Sunday morning, as well as possibly late Saturday night. And just maybe Thursday night, if you promise not to overly frighten the non--type-geeks (non-type--geeks?) I'll be hanging out with at that time. Right. As you were.

Simon, if I tell you too much, I will have to kill you. Actually I'll be staying in... Redmond (major hint) on Wednesday and Thursday nights, while Friday and Saturday are still open. I might actually end up over the border on Saturday. What number can I call you at? Please email me if you like: hpapazian_at_gmail_dot_com. And that goes for anybody else who'd like to hook up.

That should be a real treat. Enjoy.

The key to dealing with the Pacific NW weather is to have decent rain gear. Once you get accustomed to wearing plenty of Goretex®, you'll be fine.

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, thanks to your Harvest Vine recommendation Simon and I ended up at Txori*, the more casual sister. The portion sizes were like footnotes, but the tastes were like... Raffia Initials.

* http://www.txoribar.com/

On Saturday morning I drove up to New Westminster (through a freak snow storm - very pretty though) and although I was prepared to be impressed by Jim, I was still impressed. We spent an intense five hours using the pantograph (actually two of them), casting type, and punchcutting. Rarefied experiences that I might never again have; lessons that will stay with me for a long time. Some photos:

First, Jim, in one corner of his workshop. On the left side of the photo is one pantograph, for going from a cardboard inset drawing of about 9 inches to a lead plate of about 3; on the right side is the other pantograph, for going from the lead plate to an actual-size matrix.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jim_4852.jpg]

The lead plate, from a wonderful drawing by Jim. You should see the "g"!
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plate_5793.jpg]

The matrix (16 pt):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mat1_5231.jpg]

And finally the cast type!
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cast_4413.jpg]

Part 2.
A punch of a "J" that I made. Puts Neuland to shame!  :-/
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/punch_4532.jpg]

And the matrix struck from it:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mat2_6690.jpg]

Something funny happened to the punch, and the resultant matrix impression, upon striking, probably due to the punch being not fully hardened. In the end my "J" had become italic! Two glyphs with one stone, eh? Enjoy.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, some purists think even the counterpunch is blasphemous! They say the file and burin are all you should use. I'm no fan of the pantograph-only approach (even though even that can make sense sometimes) but type design is a craft, and as such needs to serve people more than serve one's own artistic urges, so efficiency is very important. The pantograph, in a hybrid process with manual "post-processing" can be a great contributor to optimal results. In the wrong hands however it can debase type design, like how optical scaling went out the window pretty quickly.

As for the photos, it's amusing -and gratifying- that you're reading so much into my camera setup! :-)  They were taken with my lowly Ricoh RDC-7*, no tripod, lousy lighting. On a wooden tray in my lap. The secret is the RDC-7's amazing macro, which can get as close as 1 cm (less than 1/2 an inch). Even with it's very modest 3.7 megapixel resolution that translates to over 2000 dpi. With a tripod and proper lighting it can do quite an amazing job, especially for its age. And it has some other unique features. I love the little thing, although it's getting a bit ragged.
