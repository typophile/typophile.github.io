  font. It's on a Cavillini Papers poster of butterflies. Apologies for the poor quality
  of the photo - I tried to find the poster on the Cavallini website but without luck.\r\n\r\nI
  suspect it's not a font as such, as each letter looks individually handwritten,
  but wondered if there was a chance someone had done some kind of reproduction of
  it.\r\n\r\nMany thanks."

    anything that might work as a substitute. I thought [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-dyrynk/|P22
    Dyrynk]] has a similar quality of looking somewhat hand-drawn and yet professional.\r\n\r\n-
