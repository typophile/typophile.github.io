  She showed me around the town where she grew up. Here's the entrance sign of her
  elementary school in Virginia, MN which was constructed in 1922:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lincolnshool_5056.jpg]\r\n\r\nOn
  the was back to Lake Vermilion, we passed through the town of Tower (pop 500). The
  town was established in 1889 shortly after the Soudan iron mine was established
  as the first iron mine in the state of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nWe pulled over to visit
  a friend, and I took this photograph:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/found_tower-mn_4988.jpg]\r\nAs
  I was taking the picture, a lady walking by told me she loved this old building
  with its old faded letters, and that a great many of the buildings in Tower used
  to be painted with advertisements like this.\r\n\r\nAfter I took that picture, I
  turned to the right and found this cute little bench nestled under a tree:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/found_towerbench_6559.jpg]\r\nWhich
  my one year old son really enjoyed:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/found_towerbencherik_4559.jpg]"
