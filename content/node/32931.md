body: "hi,\r\n\r\nI am looking for a type with the following features:\r\n- an antiqua,
  readable even in miniscule sizes;\r\n- serifs are cut strict and straight (like
  in Times, not like in Garamond or Filosofia);\r\n- axis inclination minimal or none;
  especially the \"8\" should stand still;\r\n- nice \"G\" :)\r\n- no slab-serifs.\r\n\r\nThe
  goal is to see if I can find a type, which can do better than the Times in a logotype,
  which I have to work with (and promote) for the following years to come. I guess,
  the designer either wasn't a specialist in type, or wasn't looking far enough (I
  tend to think, it's the first case).\r\n\r\nThe most tough application of this logotype
  I've met, was a laser engraving on a product, which [the engraving] measured about
  1/2 inch \xD7 1/4 inch. I will try to push the \"idea\" of a signette instead of
  4 words of the brand, but it will definitely take time.\r\n\r\nSo.... ?"

    Antiqua</a> meets your other requirements.

  body: "UltraFabulous, Minion is good, but I don't want to get into modifying the
    font (T has complex serifs, as I see it). \r\n\r\nThe Antiqua is very nice! Thank
    you, Stephen.\r\n\r\nI was also looking into Candida and High Tower, which I like
    the most - except that serifs details will be lost completely, when engraved in
    small sizes. Hmm..\r\n\r\nHere, I will show you what the point of the discussion
    is (see the image).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ho8_check_4698.gif]"

  body: I think Meridien is your best here. I'd consider aligning the "F EIGHT" with
    the 8's baseline so the spacing is better.

  body: "Do you think there should be \"f\" or \"F\"? I personally don't see any reasons
    - logical or artful - for using small f here.\r\n\r\nThough I really like Meridien's
    geometry, I am not sure about the serifs. Look:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ho8_engr_check_3422.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    metal part is about 1/2 inch wide. I mean, at these sizes it is not really important
    to try to save the serifs. You just might get the picture of the applications
    of the logo..."
