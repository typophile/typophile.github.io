  like to get the opinions of the people on this forum.  There seem to be a lot of
  knowledgeable and/or opinionated folks here. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>For this font &#40;tentatively titled Metron&#41;, I wanted
  to create an attractive, slightly futuristic sans serif typeface for display, corporate
  logos, and short lengths of text.  I also wanted to stay away from the super-geometric
  look that makes so many fonts gimmicky and unreadable.  The capitals were designed
  first, with the lowercase something of an afterthought &#40;and still unfinished&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>The typeface was built around a sketch I made of an uppercase M.  I&#39;m
  happy with it so far, but the N and the 7 have been problematic.  Also note that
  I haven&#39;t done any kerning yet. <BR> <BR>I welcome any help I can get.  Go ahead
  and be as nitpicky as you want.  I&#39;ll offer free copies &#40;once it&#39;s done&#41;
  to anyone who posts something helpful here. <BR> <BR>Paul D

  body: ' It&#39;s a bit like Bronzo as a grown-up: much smoother, but with some new
    individualistic traits. I like how there&#39;s enough organicity to give it a
    much richer character than something entirely mechanical; and it&#39;s not formally
    straight-laced, which is great &#40;like the killer divergence between the UC
    &#34;M&#34; and &#34;N&#34;&#41;. The only UC glyphs that bug me are the &#34;D&#34;
    &#40;too square&#41;, and the &#34;Q&#34;: do something drastic with it, although
    since the font is so nice in all-caps I wouldn&#39;t ruin the line with a strong
    tail &#40;except maybe as an alternate&#41;, so do something inside the bowl instead,
    like maybe cut straight from the bottom-left of the bowl to the &#40;inside&#41;
    top-left of the tail? <BR> <BR>The lc isn&#39;t nearly as convincing. For one
    thing, I think this design needs body, so make the xheight as large as you can.
    The &#34;m&#34; is great and the &#34;ae&#34; is smart, but the &#34;f&#34; and
    &#34;t&#34; are especially weak. The numerals are really nice, except the &#34;4&#34;
    needs more presence. The peculiars: try a single bar on the Dollar and Yen; lower
    and lengthen them &#40;towards the inside&#41; in the Euro. The &#34;?&#34; needs
    more presence too. The rest are pretty nice! <BR> <BR>Also: <BR>1. This design
    needs at least one darker weight. But don&#39;t bother with an italic. <BR>2.

    is an uncomfortable conflict between round and flat. For example compare the lc
    &#34;a&#34; and &#34;c&#34;. This is less obvious in the UC as a whole, for some
    reason. <BR> <BR>The other &#34;global&#34; thing that bugs me is optical: at
    smaller sizes especially, things like the descender of the lc &#34;g&#34; and
    the top of the counter of the numeral &#34;6&#34; seem to be &#34;splaying&#34;
    at uneasy angles, disturbing the otherwise wonderful serenity of this design.
    It&#39;s an illusion, and since this is a display face you might just ignore it;
    or there might be a trick &#40;like turning in the last tip of the flat part&#41;
    that might help. <BR> <BR>Some glyph-specific stuff: <BR>- Consider giving the
    UC &#34;I&#34; bars. <BR>- I know the UC &#34;M&#34; is one of your &#34;mother
    glyphs&#34; here, but I think it needs a small mod: take the middle &#34;v&#34;
    lower. <BR>- The UC &#34;Q&#34; still needs work: the inside is a little bit too
    strong now; the bottom-right is messy: what about this - make the corner a total
    90-degree angle, and the &#34;tail&#34; go into it. You&#39;ll need some optical
    compensation. <BR>- The UC &#34;X&#34; seems a bit too smooth. <BR>- The diagonal
    of the UC &#34;Z&#34; is too wavy. Make it more like the &#34;X&#34; - three clear
    segments connected with abrupt curves. <BR>- Lower the bar of the lc &#34;e&#34;
    a bit. <BR>- The &#34;f&#34; and &#34;j&#34; are malformed. <BR>- That lc &#34;r&#34;
    is going to be a spacing fiasco. <BR>- I think the lc &#34;t&#34; does need a

    it does seem a little out of place with the middle stroke breaking the baseline.
    i like both S&#39;s, but the original was making my day. nice and squareish, but
    not square. for the t, maybe a tiny little tail ala din or meta. the first one
    was stronger than the second. the 3 seems a little top heavy to me. maybe a little
    assymetry would help. v.0.2 &#34;?&#34; is good. the original S and B were great.
    i think that&#39;s the way to go. you can see how personal preference shows up
    in these critiques. interesting, eh? oh yeah... the counter in the first D was
    bowing the vertical stroke inward. the second D is much more succesful. also,
    the G stands out, but not in a good way. something to do with hrant&#39;s &#34;round

    the article: &#34;With colleague Matthew Butterick, &#40;Tobias&#41; Frere-Jones
    invented a system for the naming of successful typefaces: the name must have three

  body: The thing that bothers me about the f,  <BR>especially in the text setting,
    is that <BR>it seems too tall. It towers over all of <BR>the other letters. <BR>
    <BR>Maybe shortening it so the beak of the <BR>f is even with the dot of the i
    would help. <BR> <BR>For example.. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/3289.gif"

    character and make a original N &#40;centered&#41; similar to M or more related.
    <BR>Just a thought, Its a nice font '

  body: ' BJ: Cool article.  I keep wanting to keep the campy sci-fi-esque &#34;tron&#34;
    at the end, so my current favourite candidate is &#34;Megatron&#34;.   <BR> <BR>Kyle:
    Thanks for the f suggestion.  I was afraid to have a low crossbar, but that might
    be better than making the letter extra tall. <BR> <BR>Alejandro: I had great difficulty
    making a nice N using curved strokes on both sides like the M does.  Using only
    straight lines would make the N too &#34;normal&#34; for this typeface, I think.

  body: I think maybe a more extreme cut off of the f would even be better. Maybe
    even leaving it angled upward would keep the letter consistent with the remainder
    of the alphabet, it could either be a smooth curve or even bend it like the n
    stems...
