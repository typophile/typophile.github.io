  body: "It's quite similar to <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stop/\">Aldo
    Novarese's Stop</a> (skewed), but there are a couple of unexpected differences.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"LI\" ligature is new to me, as is the vertical bar in the \"R\", and the \"C\"
    closes up its ends, rather than cutting off straight."
