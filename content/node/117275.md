  body: By Wayne J. Stettler, 1965 for VGC. There is a font out there called GT-Stetler
    (yes, one t) that is only the caps of Stettler. Not much help, but that is the
    only digitization I'm aware of.

    and go through the similar fonts. \r\nIntersting ones include Cyrus Highsmith's
    Amira, Thierry Puyfoulhoux's Alinea Incise,  Jos\xE9 Mendoza y Almeida's Pascal,
    G\xE1bor K\xF3thay's Minerva Modern, and Hermann Zapf's Optima aka Classico or

  body: "Corrected post:\r\nGood find Mike. I was curious about what the \"GT\" refers
    to. It seems to be for Gemini Fonts\r\nAnother foundry that uses prefix _GT_ for
    its fonts is Grilli Type but they seem to have no relation to Gemini Fonts. BTW
    I have seen a version labeled GT-Stettler. Poor quality digitization, and as Mike
    said, caps only.\r\nDon"
