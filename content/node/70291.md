body: "Hi guys\r\n\r\nI'm soon to start work on designing an album cover for a local
  performer and looking for any suggestions for suitable fonts.\r\n\r\n- Theme is
  'Suburban Exotica \u2014 a Musical Celebration of the Mundane'. Meaning adding sparkle
  to everyday life.\r\n- Style is comic, loopy, jolly, convivial, showy...the kind
  of show that makes you laugh until you're high.\r\n- There was a mention of gnomes
  for the artwork inside.\r\n- Am looking for probably a display font (bold?) for
  the name and title, and a text font for the song lyrics inside. Brief is to keep
  it clear and legible, I would say sans serif for the lyrics, which might be quite
  small (7-8pt?)\r\n\r\nFonts I'm considering:\r\n<a href=\"http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/stag/sans_round\">Stag
  Sans Round</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/soft-serve/\">Soft
  Serve</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sideshow/cocktail-shaker/\">Cocktail
  Shaker</a>\r\n\r\nI used <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=ballpark_weiner&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=Suburban+Exotica&nb_ppp=10&psize=m&classt=alpha\">Ballpark
  Weiner</a> for the last bit of work I did but am ideally not looking for an italic
  script this time...not so legible.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a couple of pics of stuff
  I did before:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n523941534_1841164_234_3737.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/n523941534_1256714_8394_5205.jpg]"

    I like El Grande, Grenadine, and Pinup.\r\n\r\nOr how about something comic, loopy,
    showy and fun, but not conventionally so: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_oneleigh_ot/\">FF
    Oneleigh</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/ff_fontesque/\">FF

  body: "Pinup and El Grande are great, especially Pinup, as it's still fun but without
    being too distracting. Thanks for the link. \r\n\r\nHow about any suggestions
    for the text font for song lyrics in the booklet?"

    Unit Rounded</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bold_monday/panno_rounded_ot/">Panno
    Rounded</a> would be readable but similarly styled text companions.
