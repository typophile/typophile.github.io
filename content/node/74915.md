body: "Hello all! I've been a \"casual\" fan of type since my days in journalism school
  many years ago, in the mid eighties when \"desktop publishing\" was the hot term
  of the day.\r\nMost recently, I inherited a LARGE collection of old wooden letterpress
  type, and I've found myself falling in love with it... the original intent was to
  sell it all, but now I'm much too enamored, and I want to sort it all and collect
  it. So I have two questions here, and although I know that this is not strictly
  a \"wood type\" forum, I think someone here can probably help me with two simple
  questions.\r\nMost of the type is terribly \"pied,\" or scrambled, and while I realize
  it may take YEARS for an amateur to sort it all out, I'm determined to try. First
  question: I keep running into these strange characters which look something like
  M's and N's I've never seen before. Can anyone tell me what these are, and possibly
  what type family they might belong to? (I'll try to insert a photo here).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/samplecharacters_3847.jpg]\r\n\r\nSecond
  question: I want to clean up, preserve and display these pieces, and information
  on the care of wood type is terribly scarce online. So far, I've only used compressed
  air to blow out some of the old dust and such. I found a recommendation for mineral
  spirits as a cleaner, and I've tried that on a few samples... it really seems to
  help bring out the patina, but is not so effective as a cleaner. I know I should
  not put any kind of lacquer or varnish on the pieces, but what is the best way to
  clean and prepare for display?\r\n\r\nThanks to anyone and everyone for any little
  bit of guidance you can offer!"

    you''ll see that they''re ffi and ffl ligatures. And, why would you want to clean
    the pieces unless you plan to print with them? Better to preserve the patina,
    IMHO, which you might also accomplish with linseed oil.'

  body: thank you nick! I swear I can't see the ffi/ffl, but I don't have that great
    an eye, so perhaps it will come to me if I stare long enough. With regard to cleaning,
    I want to display them in my home. I don't see myself buying a letterpress any
    time soon, but what little I have read has given me some sense of duty to preserving
    them, because I don't want to be "that guy" who ruined an old font for some future
    user by cleaning or polishing them incorrectly. Is linseed oil a better product
    than mineral spirits for this purpose, and will it do anything to ruin the type
    for future owners/users?

    clearer now?\r\n\r\nAlso, preserving the woodtype in its \"natural\" state is
    advisable. Ancient coin collectors prize the patina that their coins acquire with
    age, and woodtype as a relic should probably be treated the same. I have a modest
    collection of xenotype, ranginf rom 36 pt to 14\" in height, an linseed oil \"feeds\"
    the wood and gives it a little sparkle without damaging it in any way."
