  body: Quite a fine job. S/s/$ seem to all be leaning a bit to the right. The stem
    of the 7 may be too thin at the top. That's about all I could spot. Getting into
    the realm of personal taste, I might question the shear on the upper left corner
    of the u.

  body: I'm having a hard time with the bold. It looks a little too 'auto bold'. I'd
    like to see the joins have a little more contrast. That being said, this is more
    of an aesthetic opinion than a technical problem with the font. Over all It's
    a pretty polished piece of work, though.
