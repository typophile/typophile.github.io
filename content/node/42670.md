    aspect of water do you want to evoke - the nature/fish/ecology/aquarium part or
    the nautical/maritime/boating part? Or surfing, dude?"

  body: "BTW  you've made up a word: envoke. It's a nice combo of evoke (to produce
    or suggest through artistry and imagination a vivid impression of reality: a short
    passage that manages to evoke the smells, colors, sounds, and shapes of that metropolis.)
    and invoke (to call for with earnest desire; make supplication or pray for: to
    invoke God's mercy.)\r\n\r\nI think evoke was more what you had in mind."

    word for \"wave,\" is the latest collaboration between Adrian Frutiger and Linotype's
    Type Director, Akira Kobayashi. This typeface family is the most humanistic sans
    serif design ever to come from Adrian Frutiger, and it has an interesting twist:
    lapidar alternates that may be surfed through with the help of OpenType-savy applications.</cite>"
