body: "I'm generating the intermediate weights from a MM fonts but I've noticed a
  problem with the placement of the accents in the uppercase glyphs of the bold weight
  that is generated.\r\n\r\nI've created the MM font with the light and bold weights,
  if I then generate the bold weight so the Generate instance weight slider is set
  to 1000 the font created is the same weight as the original bold weight used to
  create the MM font. The problem is the accents in this generated bold are higher
  than they were in the original.\r\n\r\nIn the image the glyph on the left is the
  generated bold and on the right the bold that was used to create the MM font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-2_5449.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter
  some testing it seem to only happen to the uppercase glyphs and those that are composites.\r\n\r\nIf
  I decompose the glyphs before creating the MM font the problem doesn't seem to happen.\r\n\r\nIs
  this the solution ?, do you have to decompose all the glyphs before creating the
  MM font ?"
