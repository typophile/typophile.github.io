  body: I've had LOTS of trouble with WTF. It seems it somehow does better with samples
    taken with the iPhone camera (iTouch user here) than with image files in the Photos
    folder. Perhaps because print examples are often done with far better resolution
    than the plain pixellation (YUCK) of wysiwyg display text and even anti-aliasing
    (sometimes YUCK).

    beat a panel of font folks such as at the forums, including this one. Eyes, and
    experience, will beat programming every time, when it comes to Font ID's.\r\n\r\n-
