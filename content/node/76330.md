  and Fontspring (fonts.com release to follow).\r\n\r\nWorthing aims to combine Victorian
  charm with modern-day requirements for legibility and clarity, and we hope, demonstrates
  that traditional elegance still has its place in the modern world.  Meanwhile, for
  those who our curious about the naming of our fonts, Mr Lloyd our designer was reading
  Mr Wells (H. G.) \u201CWar of the Worlds\u201D recently.  No doubt some of you will
  remember the part that Worthing in Sussex played in that story. Worthing is offered
  in three styles, regular, alternate and shaded.  It's ideal for Victorian and Edwardian
  era inspired design work, posters and signage, as well as for book covers, chapter
  headings and so forth.\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of the three Worthing faces:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Worthing_4947.png]"

  body: Yes, the straight-to-straight spacing overall seems relatively too tight to
    my eye.
