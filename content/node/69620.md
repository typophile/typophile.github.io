  graphic design, we would be happy to visit a few educational institutions. "

  body: On Trajan column, the text is some four meters underground, so go see the
    Colosseum, and walk back south under Titus Arch. A good sample of what Trajan
    is based on. And Forum Romanum after that is worth a visit. Trajan column is at
    the end of that walk, not part of FR, but on your right side after the ancient
    part.

    portico of Santa Maria in Trastevere and the entry passage to Sant'Agnese Fuori
    le Mura (Saint Agnes Outside the Walls), both of which have really funky early
    Christian inscriptions."

    treasure of some of the best art and architecture masterpieces ever. And if you
    have the time, a visit to the Vatican museums would probably be the best thing
    you can do there, apart from eating and enjoying the climate (May is great).\r\n\r\nTypographically
    speaking, the city offers a plenty of interesting stuff - the lettering on the
    buildings are every typophile's dream; just walking around lifting your head up
    will show several wonderful engraved inscriptions [a personal experience: once
    in Rome, walking in a street, I stumbled on a writing on a wall - a pre-Latin
    alphabet inscription, just standing there without any protection]. James Mosley,
    a gentle Englishman with a long time experience in Italy, has thoroughly documented
    Rome's public lettering heritage; everyone interested in typography should read
    his writings - \"Trajan revived\", in particular, for Rome references.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    there's a very interesting service named \"Typotour\", a walking tour in different
    Italian cities discovering typographical stuff. Though I never took part in it,
    I can give you some references if you're interested. Don't know about educational
    institutions."

    C'e\" it means, \"Rome is here\" or is there (it doesn't translate perfectly)
    but when I used to live in Rome I would look this site up, and there is also a
    monthly printed guide, with locations of museums and special art galleries and
    showings or events. Sometimes you might also find special events that deal more
    with the design world at special galleries around town. I suggest you buy this
    \"al edicola\" that means the newspaper stand and it will tell you everything
    that will be going on in that month such as special festivals, art galleries,
    sometimes design events, new and good restaurants and so on.\r\n\r\nI also remember
    a workshop or some sort of school on \"rilievografia\" or letterpress but I can't
    remember the site. I'll post it here if I can find it. If not then I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nF"
