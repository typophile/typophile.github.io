  body: "There's something very familiar about this script, I just don't know what
    (and it's not Coca-Cola).\r\n\r\nI tried looking in Veer, MyFonts and FontShop,
    but couldn't find anything that would match. Could be custom, but I doubt it's
    a freeware font."

    that didn't pan out. Nor did Letterhead. I'll be interested to see what it is."

  body: "It bears a superficial resemblance to <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ludlow/mandate/\">Mandate</a>
    (Freehand 521), but I don't recognize it either. This will be a good Script Guide
    addition, if someone knows it. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It also looks a lot like the sort of thing Jason Walcott (Jukebox at Veer.com)
    would do, or possibly Patrick Griffin of Canada Type. Both of them like to revive
    old pre-digital styles.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
