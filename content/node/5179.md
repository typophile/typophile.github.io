  body: I really like <a href="http://www.dotster.com/">Dotster</a>. They manage to
    take the pain out of .ca registrations, as well as handling all of the other popular
    top level domains. And if you&#39;re stuck for finding that perfect domain name,
    their alternate available domain suggestion feature is very handy.

  body: Dan, just know that registering a domain is different from  <BR>getting your
    domain hosted. You can have one company register  <BR>it and another host it,
    but it&#39;s less hassle if you know who  <BR>your host is and just have them
    register it. <BR> <BR>If you just want to register a domain and not host anything
    there  <BR>for a while, then Dotster is a great choice because it&#39;s dirt cheap.

  body: well, the best to my experience is to use a registrar who is in the same country
    as you &#43; one who provide online managing of your dns and such things related.
    Avoid to use the domain registration offered by a host, because it doesn&#39;t
    help to leave the host if trouble with it, because of the domain&#43;dns. <BR>

  body: I ended up with NetBeat, a common hoster in Germany &#40;which, I found out
    after the fact, is headquartered in Vienna&#41;. They should be all right for
    what we needed. Thanks for all of the advice! <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typeoff.de"
