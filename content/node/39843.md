  body: "in previous posts and in the wiki articles that i have authored, i have used
    \"super family\" to mean a set of related fonts that contain at least a serifed
    and an unserifed counterpart, but may also include other sytles inluding an \"informal\"
    or a \"someserifs\" style. i believe there is precedence in this kind of usage,
    as [[Ilene Strizver]] uses the term this way in <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/AboutFonts/Articles/FineTypography/Super+Families.htm\">her
    article on super families</a> for the fonts.com website.\r\n\r\nhowever, the unscientific
    poll i put together (which is linked to above) seemed to indicate that typophiles
    might prefer another term with \"suite\" and \"type system\" being offered as
    alternates. somehow i think of a \"type system\" as something different: i think
    of a system as including a range of weights and optical sizes, which may or may
    not be included in my concept of a super family. i have similar reservations about
    the term suite: to me it is a more inclusive concept.\r\n\r\nis it silly to try
    to find a term that refers specifically to types families which come in both serifed
    and unserifed flavors? maybe so, but i don't know..."

  body: "Family: A collection of related typefaces and fonts. In some cases a family
    is sort of a marketing gimmick, eg. some of the families sold by House Industries,
    or collections of old typefaces marketed together, like Akzidenz and MT Grot.
    There is a subtle distinction between family and typeface; I think that is because
    a family can be comprised of multiple typefaces whereas a typeface cannot.\r\n\r\nSuperfamily:
    A very large family of fonts that applies to a wide variety of applications. Adrien
    Frutiger generally gets credit for inventing the superfamily when he designed
    Univers. I think that to get to superfamily status a family should include two
    or more widths in multiple weights. \r\n\r\nSystem: Synonymous with family. \r\n\r\nSuite:
    I do not think that I have ever seen this term used outside of marketing materials,
    so it has no technical meaning to me."

  body: "My definition of Family is narrower than James's - I'd say a family is all
    the various weights and special features of a single font, such as ligatures,
    ornaments, condensed, etc. But only of one font. I'd put Univers here, not in
    superfamily. \r\n\r\nSuperfamily: I'd agree that it should be more extensive -
    sans + serif, for example. Thesis, Freight, families like that. And yes Rotis
    (ugh)\r\n\r\nSuite: This is what I'd call a group of fonts that work together,
    with a single theme or idea, but they could be disparate in appearance. House
    Industries collections belong here, to me.\r\n\r\nSystem: I think of my Mac OS,
    not fonts when I hear this term. Or of the mildly annoying Univers/Helvetica Neue
    way of numbering the different weights, that never really caught on."

    that we can develop a really solid consensus meaning seems distant. In seems like
    in type there are relatively few terms that are not a bit or even very amorphous.
    That said, I am utterly happy to abide by whatever consensus can be acheived.
    Paul, you have made a very good start on a case for one way to do it. I applaud
    your effort!\r\n\r\nAlternatively perhaps for the purposes of the Wiki the thing
    to do is to choose terms System, Super familily  etc; and then define them in
    some way; and then list the fonts that fit the supplied definitions. Then even
    if somebody has semantic differences with the Typophile Wiki they can still use
    the info."

  body: "Sometimes you have to accept that terms are more arbitrary & vague than one
    would like. Still, I am rooting for ya! Perhaps somebody will pose a position
    we can all rally round. It is sounding so far like the idea of 'Super' does seem
    to be associated with sans & serif combo families. And come to think of it I think
    that would be my working guess* before I saw a new font labeled as 'superfamily'.
    \r\n\r\n* But in my case it would be a very soft guess.\r\n\r\nDoes nobody like
    my idea of accepting the arbitary & just defining term we supply? I wonder if
    there is a way of using quotes around the term to imply or suggest that it's not
    a completely agreed on term... Like this: \r\n\r\n'Superfamily'"

    I say this mostly in jest of course. Similarly, why not a "Type Convolution" or
    "Type Strata". I can see more & more the wisdom of the term Family. It suggests
    variation but with commonality of features seemingly like no other term. '

    lot of fonts, with perhaps a lot of feature and language coverage--so just because
    a family has sans and serif variants wouldn't necessarily make it super."

  body: "The definitions I use are: \r\n\r\n<strong>[[Typeface]]</strong> is a collection
    of all typographic characters that share the same design characteristics such
    as weight, width, inclination, optical size, stroke modulation or treatment of
    serifs. Helvetica Bold is one typeface, Times Roman is another typeface, Times
    Bold is yet another typeface. \r\n\r\n<strong>[[Font]]</strong> is a certain physical
    form in which a typeface with a certain character set is released by a certain
    vendor under a certain trade name \u2014 for example a set of metal type sorts,
    a digital font in the Type 1 format, a digital font in the OpenType PS format
    etc. Times Roman by Linotype in Type 1 format is one font, Times Cyrillic Regular
    by Linotype in Type 1 format is another font, Times Roman Std by Adobe in OpenType
    format is another font, Dutch 801 Roman by Bitstream in Type 1 format is another
    font \u2014 all of the same typeface Times Roman. \r\n\r\n<strong>[[family|Typeface
    family]]</strong> is a set of typefaces released under a common trade name that
    differ in weight, width, inclination, optical size and character sets, but belong
    to the same stylistic class because of some common design characteristics such
    as stroke modulation and treatment of serifs. Helvetica, Times, Palatino, ITC
    Stone Sans, ITC Stone Serif, ITC Stone Informal and ITC Stone Humanist are all
    different families. \r\n\r\n<strong>[[superfamily|Typeface superfamily]]</strong>
    is a set of typefaces released under a common trade name that combines several
    families across stylistic classes. Members of a typeface superfamily differ not
    only in weight, width, inclination, optical size and character sets, but also
    in other design characteristics such as stroke modulation and treatment of serifs
    \u2014 but still share certain other characteristics such as proportions, which
    allows them to work together. ITC Stone Sans, ITC Stone Serif, ITC Stone Informal
    and ITC Stone Humanist are four families that form a superfamily. \r\n\r\n(I think
    the issue of the common trade name is important. There are often serif and sans
    families that share stylistic features and work together well, but they are designed
    by different people and released under different trade names. Those do not form
    a superfamily.)\r\n\r\nI also like another term: \r\n\r\n<strong>[[series|Typeface
    series]]</strong> is a set of typefaces that form a family, a superfamily or even
    have a looser connection, for example are designed by the same designer with a
    common thought in mind. So, any family or superfamily is a series, but also Verdana,
    Tahoma, Nina and Meiryo form a series, though not a family nor a superfamily.
    Another example of a series are Arepo, Stone Print, SFPL, and Cycles by Sumner
    Stone. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: i like that approach, Adam. as always you deliver a well-thought-out, complete,
    and concise method to approaching the problem. I think I'll start using this jargon
    myself. do others feel comfortable using Adam's definitions for the wiki?

  body: "I'd like to echo what Adam described about family vs. superfamily. The ITC
    Stone typefaces are the classic example and immediately came to my mind also when
    I read the initial post.\r\n\r\nI'll add that \"type system\" suggests to me a
    selection of typefaces designated to work together for a given purpose, and has
    more to do with an overall design program rather than the design or marketing
    of the types themselves. For instance, when I revised the brand for my former
    publisher, I chose for them three typefaces (for marketing, not publishing) --
    Iowan Old Style for working text, Vectora for supplementary sans, and PMN Caecilia
    for occasional flavor. This then constituted our \"type system.\" So I think of
    this as more of a design term than a typographic term, if that makes any sense
    to anyone.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that I've never used or even contemplated the
    term \"suite\" in a typographic context.\r\n\r\nAdam's notion of \"series\" is
    new to me, but seems quite useful. Another example might be Palatino, Aldus, and
    Michelangelo.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Adam seems dead on. It would probably be worthwhile to try passing these
    definitions by Steve Heller, Ellen Lupton, Tova Rabinowitz, and other authors
    of typography textbooks to see if they feel the definitions concur with what is
    being used in design books and schools, so that the Typowiki doesn\u2019t end
    up in conflict with some other important source."

  body: "I like that Adam's definition is thoughtful, explicit ( not vague) and lacks
    internal contradictions. It is also no-less arbitrary than another one might be.
    But as I said before, that's not a slight or criticism. \r\n\r\nThinking further,
    what I think is also useful is the way he has defined Superfamily outside of a
    serif centric model. \r\n\r\nIf a family of fonts has optical variations, italics,
    Small Caps, more than 2 kinds of figures and small caps you quickly get enough
    fonts in pure numbers to qualify for super family status I think. Arno Pro is
    the example I am thinking of. That family is huge. That is the only issue that
    I think is left still unresolved. eg Does anybody think of Arno Pro as outside
    of  Superfamily status because it lacks a Sans? \r\n\r\nAlso I think including
    a semi-serif should definitely not be the defining characteristic even if there
    is some historical basis for that position. I say this because in part because
    I don't think our terms should be encouraging or discouraging design choices in
    order to \"qualify\". And I think it would be mistake for instance to deny Meta
    as a Superfamily."

    plus I've recently completed editing the <a href=\"http://www.d2d.pl/\">Polish
    edition of Bringhurst's \"Elements\"</a>, which gave me sufficient opportunity
    to think about these things lately :) \r\n\r\nAs for the term \"series\", it was
    new to me a few years ago, but I heard many designers who worked at Mergenthaler
    Linotype (e.g. Matthew Carter, Larry Oppenberg and Dennis Pasternak) used it.
    I somehow like the concept that a series would be more general than a family,
    because <em>family</em> implies the same name (as in <em>family name</em>) while
    <em>series</em> does not. \r\n\r\nFor me, the distinction between a family and
    a superfamily is whether members of the particular series belong to different
    stylistic categories (superfamily) or just the same (family). The concept of a
    \"stylistic category\" or \"class\" is vague enough to leave some room for intepretation,
    which I think is fine. \r\n\r\nA."
