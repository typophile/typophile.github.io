  body: Try Vialog by Werner Schneider, by Linotype, 2003. <BR>SC, OsF are available,
    tru italic too. <BR> <BR>Very nice design, in similar style of Frutiger/Myriad
    but a bit narrow. <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com" target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com</a>
    <BR> <BR>Note, that Myriad Pro feature SC on the OpenType version, if I&#39;m
    correct? indeed to be used with Indesign only. <BR> <BR>Try also Parisine Caps,

  body: 'Myriad Pro has everything -- but, alas, no Small Caps. You can, however,
    faks very convincing caps by reducing the font size a bit, so that the versal
    is just about x-height chgange the letter width marginally to 105 or 110 % and
    by then changing to the next weight. Myriad has enough weights to pull that stunt
    somewhat convincingly. :-D. '

  body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Thanks a lot for the help, it&#39;s been a pretty nasty day.
    I&#39;ve had to go down the playing with weight and font size route as the project
    was already part way through layout and it would have been too disruptive to specify
    another face. <BR> <BR>You&#39;d think Myriad would be a pretty safe choice; unfortunately
    when I was designing the thing nobody told me it would need small caps. <BR> <BR>&#62;Also
    consider one of the exquisite LucasFonts sans families. <BR> <BR>Yeah, it&#39;s
    a shame I couldn&#39;t use the situation to justify purchasing &#40;pursuade the
    purse-holder to purchase&#41; TheSans family! <BR> <BR>&#62;Try also Parisine
    Caps <BR> <BR>I love your Parisine family, this is definitely on the wishlist.
    Or rather actionlist when they finally make me creative director &#40;!&#41;
