body: 'Hrant, rather than add more clutter to the Top 10 thread, I thought I&#39;d
  start a new one for our Fenway discussions. <BR> <BR>I finally had a chance to stop
  by the local B&amp;N magazine rack and take another look at those men&#39;s health/style
  mags.  <BR> <BR>In fact, <i>Men&#39;s Fitness</i> is indeed using Fenway. &#40;Along
  with plenty of super chunky FF Bau by Mr. Schwartz -- mmmm. And some slab-serif
  I don&#39;t immediately recognize.&#41; Interestingly, they&#39;re using Fenway
  ff-ligatures, which IIRC the original cut didn&#39;t have. &#40;And they aren&#39;t
  in the Fenway showing in the <i>Indie Fonts</i> book either.&#41; <BR> <BR>I looked
  again at <i>BusinessWeek</i> and I still think that their setting is a little too
  tight. I think some uneven combinations are being created. Plus, those f-lig rsb&#39;s
  are still driving me crazy. <BR> <BR>BTW, it&#39;s <i>Men&#39;s Journal</i> that&#39;s
  using Farnham -- sparingly: it looks like mostly some subheads, decks, leads. The
  main text face is FB Eldorado. Seasoned with plenty of Parkinson, Glypha, and Akzidenz.  <BR>

  body: '{Thanks for starting a fresh thread.} <BR> <BR>&#62; Men&#39;s Fitness is
    indeed using Fenway. <BR> <BR>Then they must have switched since the November
    &#39;03 issue, which clearly is not Fenway: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/34072.gif"
    alt="SIvsMF"> <BR> <BR>The top is Fenway &#40;in SI&#41;, the bottom is Zocalo
    &#40;also used by Mexico&#39;s El Universal newspaper&#41; in [my copy of] Men&#39;s
    Fitness. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s strange is that the November issue was when a redesign
    was launched &#40;including new fonts&#41;, so did the readership hate it so much
    they did another redesign? But in that case it seems very unlikely they&#39;d
    choose Fenway, since it&#39;s pretty close &#40;superficially&#41;. Are you sure
    you were looking at Men&#39;s Fitness? <BR> <BR>&#62; Along with plenty of super
    chunky FF Bau <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t see no Bau, but another great Schwartz face:

  body: Must have made a change since last fall then. That is definitely Zocalo &#40;which
    I wouldn&#39;t have characterized as &#34;another Fleischmann&#34; -- wasn&#39;t
    Highsmith&#39;s stated inspiration Kis?&#41; <BR> <BR>The current issue definitely
    uses Fenway and Bau. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/34082.jpg"

    they were going to court over it. <BR> <BR>For those keeping score: MH is currently

    look at magazines just for the type... <BR> <BR>I was sitting in the doctor&#39;s
    office with my wife &#40;we&#39;ve got one in the oven&#41; looking at a Martha
    Stewart Kids magazine and she&#39;s probably thinking I&#39;m really into this,
    but I was really thinking, &#34;Hmm, they use Joanna for the text -- what is this
