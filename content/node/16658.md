  body: "Since these are metal type, you may not be able to find a digital version
    of all of them. I will try to indicate a foundry, if I know of one that has the
    font.\r\n\r\n#1 Latin Bold Condensed (Monotype & others)\r\n#2 (don't know)\r\n#3
    Cheltenham Bold Condensed (ITC & others)\r\n#4 Latin Bold (Monotype & others)\r\n#5
    (don't know)\r\n#6 (don't know)\r\n#7 Modern No. 20 italic, or other Modern italic

    typefaces, most of our books are not going to help us. Also any idea how old these
    types are?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I think #5 looks like a heavy weight SC version of Chantrey (or Chantry).
    The U has the same thickened lower part, the numerals have the same basic shapes,
    and the other letters are what I might imagine for the heavy weight of the typeface.
    I saw it in the Rookledge Typefinder (type #584, page 234, in my edition). It
    also shows up on p.46 of the Solotype Catalog (Dover), but in a sample with few
    letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Real quick: the term \"hotmetal\" is best reserved to mean Monotype, Linotype,
    etc. where the type metal was continuously remelted and reformed (and hence was
    often warm). In contrast the other -real- stuff is best called \"foundry\", or
    maybe \"coldmetal\". To mean both/either, just use \"metal\", or maybe \"composition\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
