  body: "Body text is definitely Aper\xE7u, you could even verify it by checking css
    code as it's embedded as webfont.\r\nHard to say for the logo, very small and
    even with a [[http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/bc/01/d4/bc01d4fa781c9dad023959ab64985bdc.jpg|better
    sample]], that looks very neutral and generic. [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/neuzeit|Neuzeit]]
    ([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neuzeit-s/neuzeits-bookheavy/|S Heavy]])
    might work quite well."
