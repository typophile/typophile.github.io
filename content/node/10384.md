body: Hey! <BR> <BR>First I&#39;ve got to say that yes, I am a complete typography-n00b,
  and I will probably taint this forum with my stupidness. :D <BR> <BR>Anyways, I
  have a poster that I&#39;m working on   that consists of vector art and is kind
  of Film Noir&#39;ish in style, so I&#39;m basicly just wondering if the gurus of
  type could make some suggestions when it comes to the choice of font? &#40;Preferably
  free...&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance. :D

  body: Not really... Well, if you could point me in the direction of a font that
    looks kind of Noir&#39;ish in style, without looking cheezy... I know it&#39;s
    a vague description, but it is all I&#39;ve got. <BR> <BR>The thing is I&#39;m
    not sure how a typical Noir-font would look. I&#39;ve done some research, but
    I wasn&#39;t able to determine what could be considered as Noir&#39;ish since
    what I found was so diverse. <BR> <BR>So any help would be greatly appreciated.

    my upcoming brand for women (I'm a fashion Designer). I'm really looking for a

    \"Pop\" something Retro, but still authentically Noir...I would even go so far
    as to say something along the lines of \"B\" vampire movie styles...lol I've looked
    at some of the suggestions but they seem to be lacking a little devilishness...if
