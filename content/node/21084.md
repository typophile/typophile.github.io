  body: Many use fonts nowadays, sometimes custom made to match their own lettering
    style. Some artists still do it by hand. I think the hand lettered ones tend to
    look better, but it takes more skill and time to do it that way.

    \ She makes different fonts for different characters in her books. Now, she just
    hand letters them but rewrites and edits are a pain--so is copyfitting.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Btw, I bought the Blambot Pro set(see attached) back when I was buying fonts
    just to play with them. And it is a joy to use. Webletterer Pro looks like a nice
    one too.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blambot_6125.jpg]\r\nI wanted
    to make this a series, but couldn't think of anything clever to follow up with.
    The cleverness of this one may escape you, but it makes me laugh.\r\n; )"
