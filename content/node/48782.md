body: "Don't know how many people have got this issue, but I am wondering about a
  font on the blue double page spread (pages 6-7). On these pages there are quotes
  from famous font designers, I guess in their own typefaces, the one I want to know
  about is the quote by Adrian Frutiger, I am not sure which on of his fonts this
  is. It is quite tall and the arms of the \"E\"s seem to have a slight angle to them.
  Anyone know what this font is?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    magazine I am deeply disappointed, the design is terrible and the tips are quite
    random in there nature. I get the impression that the magazine is set up to help
    students, however their step by step tutorials are all about reproducing what's
    cool. Other magazines such as Graphic \u2014 which I love \u2014 and the rare
    'typographic' both give insights into the minds of great designers, discussing
    thought processes which is infinitely more useful for young designers, and older
    ones.\r\n\r\nNow you might well be saying \"why buy the magazine?\", which is
    fair enough, and the answer is that it only costs me $4 and occasionally there
    is something interesting.\r\n\r\nNow while I am on my rant my I bring up another
    point regarding computer arts. I have noticed in the last few issues they have
    started copying a headline style which I first saw in an issue of POL OXYGEN designed
    by Frost design Sydney. The issue won SPD silver award. Now computer arts just
    copys it. \r\n\r\nI will try to post up the font reference and the plagiarism."

    I am pretty sure the font is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/scene/black/|Scene
    Black]]\r\n\r\nI used [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/|what the font]] it's
    very handy.\r\n\r\nHere is a spread from the Pol Oxygen mentioned above (bad scan,
    this mag folds out on the y and the x axis). The grid used for the headline is
    actually the same grid used for layout throughout the mag.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pol-oxygen_5311.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
    is the poor copy from computer arts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comp-arts_5467.jpg]"

    thanks to h johnston for filling in the gap. Scene black...I'll check it out...and
    yeah computer arts isn't always good, I just picked up this one because it seemed
    to have some interesting articles in it. \r\n\r\nThat really is a blatant rip
    off!"
