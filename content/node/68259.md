    figures available.

  body: "Carl, I noticed Nebulon in TDC's Typography 30 and was very taken with it.
    It looks very legible in that tiny-size text sample. Congratulations for being
    selected for excellence in type design.\r\n\r\nConsidering all the styles and
    weights the renaming must have been a pain. "

  body: "Hi Nick!\r\n\r\nAs you probably know, naming isn't fun in FL anyway. The
    challenge seems to be getting all those fields filled correctly. Note that this
    release is only the Wide set; Square and Narrow sets to come later."
