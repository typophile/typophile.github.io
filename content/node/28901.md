  tried converting few existing faces into the curves to see the node structure and
  they really looks so perfect and almost the same structure in most of the typefaces.\r\nBut
  mine looks totally unprofessional and dirty. Please tell me how they work in the

    to put a point here or there to get the curves you want, but this is ok so long
    as you have points at the extremes. (Also there are some exceptions to needing
    points at the extremes, such as at the terminal of the e and similar situations.)\r\n\r\nIn
    Font Lab control-e (windows) will automatically put the nodes at extremes, but
    you may want to do it selectively. "

  body: "I am relatively new to drawing type, but experienced pros here on typophile
    say they used to start drawings in Illustrator but now work directly in Font Lab.
    \r\n\r\nThe most basic thing, according to Leslie Cabarga, is that when you delete
    a node the outline springs out instead of collapsing as in Illustrator. For letters
    this is useful. The are a whole lot of other things also that FontLab does, but
    download a free demo of one of their products and you can try it and explore for
    yourself.\r\n\r\nFontLab is not very intuitive at first, but is very powerful,
    and you will keep discovering new things as you use it.   "

    the stems flare a smidge. If the stems were completely vertical, there'd be no
    need for two nodes. The \"t\" I'm not so sure about. Once you import into FontLab,
    the Font  Audit feature would give you an error message about these points. It's
    a useful tool...but completely useless for a rough looking font.\r\n\r\nPieter's

  body: "If it's Frutiger, those aren't \"extra\": those are what it took to get the
    curve he wanted. If you ask me Frutiger typeface is one of those that is worth
    studying again and again--a masterwork from a master. \r\n\r\nBecause with Bezier
    curves you are dealing with cubic equations, there is a limit on what shape you
    can draw from point to point. So if you want a different shape between nodes than
    what you can get with one Bezier curve, you need more nodes to get what you want.
    \ \r\n\r\nMore experienced type heads than I can tell you more, but I would say
    draw it with as many nodes as it takes to get the shape you want. Then copy to
    mask and take away all but the extremes. Then adjust handles and maybe nodes to
    approximate what you had originally. Then add more nodes if not satisfied. Repeat
    again and again and ..... \r\n\r\nIf you open a number of good typefaces you will
    see in what situations intermediate points are added. But the eye is the final
    arbiter. "

    why one of Evert Bloemsma's typefaces had so many points on it! It didn't have

    FontLab outlines to prove it."

    occurred to me, and may be the case here, but I suspect you will find if imported
    into fontographer or fontlab that you will get a significant number of points
    between the extremes. This is because, as Terry said, there are subtle flairs
    in Frutiger. They don't give the look of obvious flairs, but rather give balance
    and liveliness to the letters. I don't own it or I'd post examples; perhaps others
    can. "

  body: ">benefits of having minimum nodes in letters?\r\n\r\n1. Theoretically, it
    will operate as a program more quickly, but this is not significant with modern
    computers, I have heard. \r\n\r\n2. Putting nodes at the extremes tells automatic
    hinting to hint correctly. As I understand it this is the main reason to put them
    there. Some of the tech-savy people can tell you more about this. \r\n\r\n3. On
    your 'S', it does normally have some nodes along the spine. This is not a problem.
    But you have a stray node off any line. This might mess up your font. You will
    probably get a warning from FontLab that you have off-curve points, if you try
    to generate a font (which you can't do with the demo, I think).\r\n\r\n4. Generally,
    when you have more nodes you have more problem making a smooth curve. The trade-off
    is that with fewer nodes, you may not be able to get the curve you want. There
    are no rules about this, so far as I know. You just work with it until it looks
    good to your eyes. "
