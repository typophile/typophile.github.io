  by a series of specimens on the H&amp;F-J website in which the first line of a body

  period practice in not supplying small caps. For example: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/didot/light.html"

  body: <i>Can anyone tell me when small caps became a regular fixture of the typographic
    landscape?</i> <BR> <BR>Smallcaps were very definitely part of the typographic
    landscape by the time of the Didot and other romantic types of the later 18th
    and early 19th centuries. <BR> <BR>Margaret M. Smith wrote an excellent essay
    for the Printing Historical Society journal &#40;No.22, I think&#41;, on the &#39;pre-history&#39;
    of smallcaps, tracing their development in early renaissance printing, beginning
    with the use of caps from smaller fonts, and progressing to properly designed
    smallcaps as we know them.

  body: 'Since nobody, other than Didot, has figured out how to make his types work
    in text &#40;one reason being that the digital revivals are all based on display
    models, not text models&#41;, why not use one of only three Didone types that
    actually do work in text? These are, Lange&#39;s Bodoni Old Face, Stone&#39;s
    ITC Bodoni, and Berthold&#39;s Walbaum STANDARD, a text font not to be confused
    with Berthold Walbaum BUCH which, in spite of its name, is a display font. I think
    all of these faces have small caps. In any case, the problem isn&#39;t having
    small caps. The problem is having a text font that actually works as a text font.
    Oh - and of course - the obvious digital choice for a Didone with a thousand bells
    and whistles: Kepler MM, with three unbelievably extensive axes &#40;weight, width,
    optical size&#41;. Though I can&#39;t really say I like it, and although I don&#39;t
    think the optical axis has been well-implemented, and although it is of course
    a Didone rather than a Didot, it cannot be gainsaid that Kepler is the most flexible
    digital font ever made. It is less like having a typeface, more like having an
    entire type library. If you don&#39;t have a problem with the fundamental design,
    there is not a conceivable composition problem that it cannot solve.  <BR> <BR>Finally
    I must say that the single ugliest bit of typography I have ever seen in my life
    was an issue of Serif magazine set in Hoefler Didot. Maybe there&#39;s a way of
    using it in text that works adequately, but if there is, Don Hosek sure didn&#39;t
    find it. <BR> <BR>It is interesting that an easily usable text Didot &#40;as opposed
    to a Didone&#41; has never been revived in the entire history of type. That shows
    how difficult it is, and that it simply isn&#39;t an appealing task for designers
    and manufacturers. Didot&#39;s own text types are much more readable than anything
    we have seen revived but, looking at them, it is difficult to summon any great
    enthusiasm when his followers such as Bodoni, Walbaum, Prillwitz &#40;whose work
    has been revived in a still very rare digital font&#41; and the English school,
    have done such a much better job with text. Nevertheless, this remains an interesting
    unfilled gap. &#40;I am sorry to speak of Didot as if there were only one but
    it is convenient to do so; in fact it is a dynasty with several key players and
    several different punchcutters with unique styles producing a wide range of continuously
    evolving and disparate designs from roughly 1780 to 1830.&#41;  <BR> <BR>The Didot
    type usable at text sizes that I have been designing for a million years, without
    yet actually releasing, would not be describable as a Didone type, but as a French
    oldstyle-based transitional. In any case, it has never been a straight revival.
    There is a real need, especially in French publishing, for a usable text face
    that looks like a Didot but acts, as to legibility, like a Jannon. <BR> <BR>Somewhere
    I have a version of Adagio Didot that I attempted to optimize for text. It is
    stiff, amateurish and unconvincing in my opinion. But anyone who wants to have
    a look at this embarassing thing just has to email me. At the very least, it illustrates
    some of the problems of the genre. Isn&#39;t it strange that Frutiger didn&#39;t
    figure a way out of this problem? I wonder what the type was really intended for.
    Perhaps I haven&#39;t adequately studied it.'

  body: Mark, re. Diderot, I have a set of pages from two sections &#40;writing and
    alphabets&#41;, and can check the type used. I&#39;ll upload some photos shortly.
    If I recall correctly, the Diderot was not set in a romantic &#40;Didone&#41;
    type, although obviously there is a cultural relationship between the rationalisation
    of knowledge and the rationalisation of type design. <BR> <BR>At the 1998 ATypI
    in Lyons, I spoke about Fournier&#39;s cataloguing of non-Latin writing systems
    in his Manual&#42;, and likened it to Diderot&#39;s project. Cataloguing and organising
    knowledge -- even dubious knowledge, such as the supposed angelic alphabet --
    was very much the programme of the day. <BR> <BR>&#42; Most of Fournier&#39;s
    examples &#40;woodblocks, not type&#41; originate with the Breitkopf foundry in
    Leipzig, a reminder of the longstanding international nature of the type business.
    Thanks to James Mosley for bringing this to my attention.

  body: John is right to bring up Fournier for at least two reasons. First, there
    are some wonderful historical types there. Second, there is the issue he touches
    on indirectly, that it is not necessary, as to historical correctness, to set
    a book in a type exactly contemporaneous with its publication; it can easily and
    appropriately be set in one from say fifty years before. Mixtures of type shouldn&#39;t
    be out of the question either. For example, F.A. Didot &amp; his collaborators
    created some extraordinary transitional types, but they were always rather large,
    14 points at least. If a book set in these types also required a smaller type,
    Didot would use Jannon. This is hardly ideal, but it was certainly practised.
    &#40;Fournier would have actually been a better choice than Jannon, one must say!
    But the Didots were terrible misers, it seems, and perhaps it would have cost
    too much.&#41; <BR> <BR>As to Fournier, there is no adequate digitization, and
    one is needed. However, given the excellence of Monotype&#39;s metal revival,
    which is especially impressive in the smallest sizes &#40;the 8, or is it the
    9 point? is absolutely gem like, a miracle of precision, readability and beauty,
    much more impressive than the larger sizes in my view&#41;, why not use that if
    the budget allows? There are some printers who can still do this, and the price
    might be surprisingly reasonable. It is hardly a seller&#39;s market. <BR> <BR>Mark,
    you are right, it is astounding to handle these gems of 18th century French printing,
    which seem to leap from the page. The brilliance of the bookwork is often astounding
    to this day.  <BR> <BR>Yet much of this richness and impact can be achieved today
    by the simple expedient of employing a printer with a monotype. And just think
    - you won&#39;t have to worry about kerning, and bogus optical kerning systems.
    You just have the type.  <BR> <BR>I really don&#39;t know why type enthusiasts
    don&#39;t focus a little more on throwing work the way of the printers who still
    use mono and linotypes. Can it be that few of us have any actual publishing projects?
    If so, one wonders, why on earth are we so interested? Isn&#39;t the final goal
    of it all to produce beautiful books?

  body: I have the small specimen in Talley of Types, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
    really that good, and in any case I have lent the book to someone. The main difference
    is that it is slightly heavier than Fournier. I honestly think the 1970s Talley
    is overinked and does not show any of the MT types at their best. I realize that
    is a little heretical, but .... I also honestly think the best MT sizes are generallly
    in the 8-11 range, and then in the above 36 pt range. Anyway, there must be a
    better sample of Barbou than what I have. If I recall correctly, it was only cut
    in one size. Looking again at one of my favourite books set in Fournier, &#39;The
    Contemplative Life&#39; by Sister Edna Mary, Penguin, 1968 &#40;which is incidentally
    the first &#40;and for that matter the only&#41; book I have ever read to suggest
    that the Redeemer was clearly bisexual, a claim which for some reason raised no
    fuss at the time&#41;, I see that the thinness does cause colour and fitting problems.
    It becomes clear why revival is such a difficult task. One understands why MT
    had so much trouble with the digital revival, and left it until quite late, why
    Typoart made so many changes in its interesting adapatation, and why Carter started
    out with the assignment of making a Fournier revival and somehow wound up with
    Charter instead. Although I like Fournier&#39;s weight, I can now finally see
    why &#39;Barbou&#39; would have been much easier to deal with and a better starting
    point. I can now finally understand Stanley Morison&#39;s point. There are so
    many Fournier types - is the Diderot one of them? It seems well within that style
    - post Romain du Roi, more practical, etc. However, the italic of Fournier is
    a straight copy of the italic of Romain du Roi as we all have posted a hundred
    thousand times in the past. So much for collective wisdom and the continuity of
    community. James Mosley had to print a book in digital Fournier and was unhappy;
    I attempted to revise it for him but was not successful - at that time I had some
    idea there was a problem but no clue as to what was really wrong, and James was
    not particulary good at explaining what was wrong. He just knew it was unconvincing.
    I do think the text type you show is too loosely fitted. I am not suggesting you
    do this, as it would be agony, but it would be so interesting to see a few lines
    of text in which one did some meticulous splicing to decrease the spaces slightly.
