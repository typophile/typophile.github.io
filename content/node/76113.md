  I figured that the sans serif face was Gill Sans, but can't figure out what the
  serif face is.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5906.jpg]"

  body: It could be Adobe Garamond Italic, expanded and slanted manually. The sans
    serif is closer to Bliss by Jeremy Tankard.
