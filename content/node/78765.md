body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nI've got a number of type faces in need of fontisizing. (That
  is, extending the character set and wrangling all the OT tables to make it work
  in modern usage)\r\nFor instance, see the thumbnails at http://alphabets.com: \r\nCyberGothic
  and Quanta Uncial are two initial prospects.\r\n<img src=\"http://alphabets.com/images/peterAlphabetFonts-4.gif\"
  />\r\n<img src=\"http://alphabets.com/images/peterAlphabetFonts-6.gif\" /> \r\nThese
  are my own designs, with origins going back to the 1990s, when Alphabets was still
  a functioning foundry.\r\n\r\nI have another family or two in progress based on
  the type in a book in my library from the early 1500s. These will have plenty of
  cool OpenType subs and so forth. \r\n\r\nThe sad fact is that as much as I love
  letters I finally can't bring myself to sit in front of FontLab and twiddle control
  points and OpenType tables. My eyes glaze over and my mind turns to mush.\r\n\r\nI'd
  be happy to share credit and (whatever meager) income may come from these with a
  careful collaborator who would extend the initial character set for OpenType and
  so forth, in consultation with me for type direction. Or else I'd be happy to license/sell
  the whole bunch of Alphabets families (even the domain name, I've still got fontsonline.com
  in fact) to a foundry who can actually do something with them, as my business ventures
  tend to turn gold into lead, rather than the other way 'round. (Not a terrible thing
  for a letterpress printer, you may say, but see what happened to Gutenberg!?)\r\n\r\nPlease
  drop me a note if you have any interest, and can provide examples, etc.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Hrant\r\nThanks for your note.\r\nWell, part of the problem is simply
    that I've got too much else on my hands (ie life :-) to deal with getting them
    ready for MyFonts etc.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty there to start with, but not enough
    to make a proper typographic tool.\r\n\r\nGuess I'm just not cut out for fontography
    after all.\r\n\r\nHope all's well.\r\n\r\nPeter"
