  to dig into. [[http://theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic|League Gothic]]
  seemed a rather straightforward to draw, so I\u2019ve made this Cyrillic cut and
  left it forgotten. Now I've dusted off the work and here it is, the League Gothic
  Cyrillic.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not a native Cyrillic reader. I\u2019ve looked into basic
  calligraphy and analyzed a bunch of different typefaces, but of course that\u2019s
  still just [[http://twitter.com/gerryleonidas/status/159779909294768128|\u201Fa

  it would really need to be decent. Make it a tough critique. Thanks a lot.\r\n\r\n<img

    the glyphs, so take this with a huge grain of salt. \r\n\r\nThe thing that looks
    lik a 6, doesn't turn up clearly enough I think. It appears to be just a straight
    line.\r\n\r\nThe egyptian looking rectangle with a bend on the left side (got
    it?), appears to be going down vertically on the very top. It should, however,
    start at a slight angle from the top.\r\n\r\nFor more and better feedback, you
    might want to ask cyreal.org for consultancy.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "I believe lowercase \u0444 is usually supposed to have two distinct bowls
    and would be better made by simply fusing d+p or q+b. I'm not native either but
    I'm pretty sure of this point."

  body: "It was my intent to make the lowercase <em>\u0431</em> turn-up subtle, but
    it indeed gets lost entirely, especially on screen, where it's mainly expected
    to be used, after all. Similarly with both <em>\u0414</em> and <em>\u041B</em>,
    but I can't quite imagine how this could be worked out at such compression.\r\n\r\nFusing
    two bowls for lowercase <em>\u0444</em> seemed to me like cheating at first, but
    now I've dug this further and it seems you're right, Kevin. Simply merging <em>d</em>
    with <em>p</em> still feels too barbaric to me, but it definitely has to be some
    form of two distinct bowls. It\u2019s the Greek lowercase <em>\u03C6</em> in which
    a single bowl is more adequate, I suppose.\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback! There
    are few really useful resources to be found at [[http://cyreal.org/|Cyreal]],
    I\u2019ll check that later."

  body: "Great work Grzegorz, League Gothic is one of my favourite fonts and I'm really
    happy to see that someone made the effort to cyrillise it! \r\n\r\nI just want
    to add some details about cyrillic characters as a native speaker. Hope that can
    be of any help to you and everyone else who is interested. Unfortunately most
    of the cyrillic examples which can be found in OSs and even Pro fonts are not
    very good.\r\n\r\nSome of the main problems usually are with the letters \u0414,
    \u041B, \u0424. \u0414 and \u041B should actually be based on a triangle, more
    like the letter A. The rectangular shape is also considered correct but in many
    cases it's not very legible due to the big resemblance to \u041F. \r\n\r\nYour
    first version of the \u0424 was actually more accurate in my opinion. It should
    be like an O cut in two halves and the stem added between them.\r\n\r\nThe greatest
    problem though is with lowercase forms. As in latin there are actually different
    forms derived from handwriting. In most typefaces lowercase is just made to resemble
    the uppercase, and the result is something like small caps. \r\n\r\nHere are a
    few examples of very beautiful cyrillic fonts with proper lowercase so you can
    see what I mean. \r\n[[http://sdrv.ms/TCNNix]]\r\n\r\nYou can also look at this
    site http://www.hermessoft.com/ for other examples. There are very comprehensive
    specimens of different typefaces."

  body: "Ivan, those are really interesting thoughts. I once came across a [[http://karandash.eu/study-myriad-bulgarian-cut/|remake
    of the Myriad Pro\u2019s Cyrillic]] from a Bulgarian designer Vassil Kateliev
    and it answers the concerns of the letters \u0414 and \u041B you\u2019ve just
    raised. Now I see you have Bulgarian background too; are you sure those issues
    are not related to this so-called Bulgarian cut alone? I\u2019ve seen cases of
    both cursive and italic styles of Russian Cyrillic that indeed had those letters
    based on a triangle, but still can\u2019t quite recall any upright ones.\r\n\r\nIn
    regard to the form of a lowercase \u0444, I\u2019m curious if it has something
    to do with a particular style of a typeface. I mean, is it possible that condensed
    grotesques like ParaType\u2019s Hermes mentioned above deliberately have the letter
    \u0444 with two distinct bowls as opposed to single one in a humanist face like
    Myriad, for example?"

  body: "@Rolek, Congratulations on your attempt , it seems pretty well done! \r\n\r\nAbout
    your concerns of the shape of some letters:\r\n- about -\u041B- and -\u0414- and
    triangular shapes or not - long story short - both are correct, but the so called
    \"rectangular\" shapes are preferred in Russia, and \"triangular\" are preferred
    in Bulgaria and Ukraine (as far as I know). The difference has historical roots,
    and has a stylistic aspect also... but nowadays I consider it more a personal
    preference and commercial targeting - it is often wise to make the \"classic Russian\"
    type your \"main Cyrillic\" and if it suits the typeface, to put \"triangular\"
    as alternates.\r\n\r\n- ascenders in some of lowercase glyphs (if you are looking
    for reference in my \"bulgarian cut\" of Myriad Pro), meaning that -\u043A-, -\u0436-,
    -\u044E- have ascenders - is typical Bulgarian - it also has historical and stylistic
    roots - so it's wise (commercially) to implement these only as alternates :)\r\n\r\n-
    same goes to a strange lovercase -\u0432- and -\u0431- , triangular lovercase
    -\u043B- and -\u043C-, -\u043F- looking like based on latin -n- and -\u0438-,-\u0439-,-\u0448-,-\u0449-
    based on latin -u-...\r\n\r\nDo not misunderstand me... I consider both ways of
    implementing Cyrillic as correct, just have a personal preference to Bulgarian
    Cyrillic, because I find that it is more \"in tone\" with it's Latin counterpart,
    thus keeping the overall style of the typeface  - on the other hand \"Russian
    style Cyrillic\" has far bigger market and many defenders - so it's better to
    keep making Cyrillic that way...."
