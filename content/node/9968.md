  body: I think the roman is Bembo but not sure which version. When is the sample
    from? <BR> <BR>The italic looks like a Garamond, but again I&#39;m not sure which
    one.

  body: Yes, that&#39;s why I asked for the source of the sample, it looks pre-digital.

  body: Both the roman and italic seem to be an exact match for Monotype Garamond
    in my Jaspert Encyclopedia of typefaces, 1970. It has little photo type. So, yes,
    pre-digital and pre-photo. Boy, will I be surprised if it&#39;s not metal.
