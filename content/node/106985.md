body: We have a large initiative at our organization.  We have purchased new Microsoft
  Office 365 and will be changing the way our business collaborates, connects, communicates,
  contricutes, and creates using the different  tools.  We will be using cloud hosted
  SharePoint, Yammer, Lync, Skydrive, and Office 2013.   We have selected a name "AC
  Commons" to represent a common place to do all of these things.  We were thinking
  a green color.  Does anyone have any recommendations for a logo design for this
  title?  Thank you!

    approach to get a logo for your \"AC Commons\" project. A logo should be designed
    by someone who knows your organization, the image it is trying to project, it's
    goals, etc.  Asking for logo ideas on a website like this will get top-of-the-head
    ideas from people who know little or nothing about your organization.\r\n\r\nThe
    best solution is to hire a professional graphic designer to work with you. If
    your budget doesn't permit that, perhaps a graphic design student at a local university
    would be willing to give free help in order to get a nice portfolio piece. And
    if you are a non-profit, you might find a professional designer willing to donate
    their services."
