  FAP 4 for Windows.\r\n\r\nI've just installed the RC1 and all went smoothly. EXCEPT
  now, while correctly listing all my fonts in their various Libraries and Sets, FontAgent
  Pro shows them ALL as being INactive.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing I did not follow some
  correct order of steps during the install.\r\n\r\nAny aid here?\r\n\r\nJim"
