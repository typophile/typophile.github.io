  company that presented today it&#39;s new Identity where joins Natural Gaz &#43;
  Electricity and gets a brand new band designed by MY BRAND. <BR> <BR>According to
  the company after a series of clients survey, they considered the old identity as
  &#34;distant&#34; &amp; &#34;Abusive&#34; &#40;BLUE LOGO BELOW&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The
  new Identity is described as &#34;A smile looking for CLOSENESS&#34;. <BR> <BR><img

  do the typophiles think? The change of a turbine for a smile is a radical shift,
  but on my oppinion the &#34;smile on a house light switch&#34; with the VAG Rounded
  Bold fails on giving the strong and secure group this group has. This brand and
  this type could be on a candy bar... '

  body: I can appreciate the amount of effort it has taken you to arrive at this simple
    and effective mark. I wonder if you would like to pursue this further by using
    a photo of a light switch with the two screws as eyes and the drawn smile you
    have above. Then it could not be confused with, or look as if it should be a mark
    for a candy bar.

    a strong, reputable company that I feel should be. <BR>A serif font would&#39;ve
    worked better in my mind.

    but I would repeat that <BR>what shown is not a smile because it has no eyes,
    <BR>besides people usually have no square faces, <BR>but I&#39;ve never been in
