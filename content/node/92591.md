  body: "\u201CThe new typeface\u2019s refinements included special rethinking of
    details such as the letters\u2019 terminals and stroke endings, as well as the
    fonts\u2019 spacing and the kerning.\u201D (http://www.linotype.com/5737/tradegothicnext.html)\r\n\r\n\u201CMany
    additional features were added into the typeface during the design process. Each
    font includes small caps and oldstyle figures. There are also a number of alternates\u201D.

    you think it makes any difference in webfont rendering?"

    would mainly regard hinting, so you will need to compare directly the output of
    the various offerings.\r\nFor example: http://webfonts.fonts.com/en-US/Project/ChooseFonts?fontQuery=din"

  body: "\u201CNext\u201D is simply Linotype\u2019s label for typefaces that they
    feel have been revised enough to warrant a new name. Some are more comprehensive
    revisions than others. Of course, marketing does have something to do with this,
    but the distinction is also useful because the typefaces really are different.\r\n\r\nThe
    Next label has no direct relation to webfont quality. As Riccardo said, the best
    way to judge that is by viewing screenshots. Webfonts.fonts.com offers the two
    Trade Gothics and DIN Next. DIN (the <a href=\"http://dinfont.com/story/\">original
    name</a> is indeed all caps) is also available as <a href=\"https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/din\">FF
    DIN Web</a> (no screenshots yet available, but I can tell you it's quite good)
    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-text-pro/?refby=typographica\">PF
    Din</a> (<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-text-pro/regular/gallery.html\">screenshots</a>),
    which is quite a different design."
