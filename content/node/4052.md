  <BR>Any other examples of this you guys know of? Particularly where it&#39;s not
  a self-conscious act. When the writer is explicitly trying to make a point about
  the reversal, it&#39;s a lot less interesting [to me]. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    aspect making courier feel a little friendlier and more expression. Plus, the
    kids don&#39;t have to read complicated script shapes! &#40;especially if they
    don&#39;t know how to write them&#41; It was probably conscious in some way though
    I agree with you there&#39;s a paradox there.. especially courier! '

  body: Hrant, can you let us know the name of the book? I remember reading it to
    my daughter in the bookstore a while back and thought how cool the lettering was.  <BR>
    <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: 'Might it have been a way for people with imperfect lettering skills &#40;probably
    90% of us...&#41; to save money on typesetting? I think at the very least the
    difficulty of getting good setting for cheap was a catalyst for giving it such
    a &#34;hand-made-font&#34; look. Saving money and creativity often go hand-in-hand.
    Frankling was wrong: it&#39;s not necessity that&#39;s the mother of invention,
    it&#39;s laziness! And greed is its father. <BR> <BR>One interesting thing in
    my sample above is that Courier&#39;s bad spacing &#40;being a monospaced font&#41;
    has been reproduced exactly! It seems like the author used tracing paper directly
    over laserprinted settings of Courier... In the 70s, maybe they used font specimen
    books that way? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Yes, in the 70s we used to comp headlines for rough layouts by tracing over
    specimen books. The layout paper pads were not tracing paper, but high-quality
    rag paper, with enough transparency to do this &#40;or trace over one&#39;s previous
    sketches, or a photocopy blow-up, whatever&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, back then, &#34;the
    preposterous google&#34; represents a &#34;rough layout&#34; look that was being
    used as finished artwork. &#40;After all, illustrators would have been familiar
    with receiving &#34;tight comp&#34; layouts with this kind of lettering, from
    art directors, for positioning their illustrations.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Now, the traced
    Courier appears to be about humanizing technology, and also represents the present-day
    myth that stuff for kids should look crudely formed, like they did it.  <BR> <BR>That
    is really &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; stupid, IMHO -- not the way
    to educate children at all. Just because kids can&#39;t do sophisticated handwriting,
    doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t appreciate or understand it. Besides, Adults can&#39;t
    write any better either! <BR> <BR>Sure, Dr Seuss had wacky wonky lettering on
    his book covers, but it was beautifully drawn &#40;unlike the recent travesty
    of his lettering in the Myers movie which was carried over into his re-released
    books&#41;, and inside his books the youngsters got Garamond and Century. No wonder
    boomers are so much smarter than subsequent generations -- we grew up reading
    decent typography!

  body: '&#62; &#39;so can you watch&#39; has been shifted half a width <BR> <BR>Probably
    because it has a different parity than all the other lines &#40;it&#39;s an even
    number of characters while all the rest are odd&#41;. That probably reinforces
    the probability that it was done by tracing over a DTP composition. <BR> <BR>hhp
