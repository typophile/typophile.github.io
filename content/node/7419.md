  body: Hm, looks selfmade to me.. If I had to guess I&#39;d say this probably started
    out as some variant of Futura and then &#40;d&#41;evolved from there.

  body: thanks Franz for all your help. <BR>I really like the R on the example - do
    you know what else might come close?

  body: The large counter of the R is a characteristic of the recent House <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTRAFACE-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank">&#39;Neutraface&#39;</a> fonts. The display and the bold weights
    are similar to your sample, I think.
