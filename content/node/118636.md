    the top-heaviness, it gives it an interesting dynamic. In \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018g\u2019
    the effect seems perhaps a bit overdone. What kind of usage/sizes would this be
    for?"

    a, g, u: I\u2019m wondering. Glad you like it, though.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of usage?
    well, I think mainly for advertising, branding, packaging, stationary, titlings,
    covers, labels, short or medium-lenght texts. In first trials it proves to be
    rather handsome for reading. We\u2019ll see.\r\n\r\nTo be entirely honest, my
    current whisky has been (subconciously) a key source of inspiration for the type\u2019s
    flavour  ;-}"

    the overall letter shape tapering of /a/ and /g/ might be more subtly done, and
    I'd add /n/m/h/. "

  body: "I gather that \"I'm wondering\" means my criticism was much too vague.\r\nu
    has a dent partway up the left side from which the stroke flares in both directions.
    It should continue to taper downward through the curve, or, if you feel the weight
    in that bottom curve is necessary, taper upward."

  body: "no \u2013 not too vague. I see your point with the u. The general rule here
    is that a stroke flares towards the top. But the left side of the u (and the t!)
    have a bottom bow which usually is a place for a stress, too. A contradiction,
    sort of. I left it as it was because I think it works that way. I think the disturbance
    is minimal.\r\n\r\nSimilar with a and g. Yes they are slightly overdone, a calculated
    twist within the framework of the whole set. Also the z is a bit overdone \u2026
    I like it and, again, in testing with text those details did not seem to disturb
    readability. \r\nSorry to say that, but for now it\u2019s too late for more changes.

    I was. And I considered every point of critique raised. You know that I\u2019m
    really open for improvement suggestions. But I came in this case, apparently,
    to different conclusions regarding the details.\r\n\r\nWhich spacing is not satisfactory?\r\n\r\nI
    am (and was before) fully aware of that such a quick release would cause critique
    as well. I\u2019m sorry if you are disappointed about that. This was not my intention.
    I would not have released it if I were not convinced that the font is mature for
    use.\r\nHope you are not too angry about me.\r\n"

  body: "I\u2019m not angry, just a bit surprised :) Personally I think this could
    have been even more.\r\nSpacing: What made me wonder is that in the sample above,
    the \u201Co\u201D looks like it\u2019s shifted left \u2013 too tight on the left
    and/or loose on the right. And maybe the arches are a little loose? On MyFonts,
    it looks better, but even a \u201Cnnnnonnnn\u201D or \u201Cnnninnnonnn\u201D string
    looks still not entirely evenly spaced to me... And in the  specimen images, the
    smaller text (in the address of the solicitors) has a bunch of really strange
    pairs (\u201Cng\u201D loose, \u201Cil\u201D tight\u2026) Words like \u201CBuilding\u201D
    do not look great to me in the preview, either. I\u2019m not sure if that can
    be the rendering, or maybe I\u2019m misunderstanding something."

  body: "I use TextEdit for setting the examples, because it does very good and even
    font rendering (much better than InDesign!). But it has one shortcoming: in small
    sizes it does not always reproduce the spacing very good. Maybe I neglected this
    a bit \u2026 therefore some parts in the smaller lines appear to be a little odd.
    However, I would not say that there are really severe faults here, I would have
    seen them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lindau_nom1_4357.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    shows TextEdit (top) and Firefox (bottom). When viewed at such a size, I\u2019d
    say this is OK. Nevertheless, at a closer look there is some unevenness in the
    spacing, but for some good reason:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lindau_nom2_4614.png]\r\n\r\nBecause
    of the more narrow area at top right (of the o, red) there is a matching slight
    constriction on the left side. This should balance the wider parts around the
    o, which are distributet reversely.\r\n"
