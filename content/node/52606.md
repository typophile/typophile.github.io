  this one? All the options I currently have are too \"effected\". \r\nThank you.
  Much appreciated. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6730.jpg]"

  body: If I understand what you are asking, you are looking for a distressed face,
    but not one that is overly effected. I would not look for a distressed slab. I
    would choose an appropriate slab, set it in InDesign or Illustrator and then distress
    it in Photoshop. This one looks like it was distressed inside Photoshop. Note
    that the L's and the A's are differently distressed. There are many tutorials
    online that can help you get started. One technique is to use a photograph, destroy
    it through any variety of means, levels, adjustments, filters, threshold settings,
    until you whittle it down into an abstract pattern and then apply the pattern
    to the type. Another which was recently discussed in the tutorial section of The
    Font Feed recommends using filters on the type itself to distress it.

    Weathered Stamped Look</a> that can be used on any typeface. This will get you
    part of the way there anyway. \r\n\r\nYou could also use the <a href=\"http://www.misterretro.com/image_filters.html\">Machine
    Wash Filters</a> from Mister Retro.\r\n\r\nFor those of you naysayers who think
    it's lazy to start with a filter I'll just add that these are great ways to <em>start</em>
    for anyone. For some they are good enough as they are, but others are always welcome
    to continue the tweakage.\r\n\r\nNote: I think Yves tutorial above had a rough
    draft version <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/74\">here on Typophile</a> first."

  body: Oops! I should have been more clear. Sorry. Distressing totally aside (but
    thank you for your suggestions), I meant, I'm looking for a typeface similar to
    the above, slab serif that is slightly stylized. I have some slab serifs that
    one might say look "western", or cute, or stylized but they are too much so, such
    as Cg Barnum Block. Clarendon extra bold is nice, but I need something a little
    more stylized than say, Clarendon. Hope this makes sense. And again, thanks.
