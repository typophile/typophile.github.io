  to share my latest typography-related project with you. Every year on the 5th of
  December we celebrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinterklaas\" target=blank>Sinterklaas</a>
  in the Netherlands. One of the traditional gifts is the chocolate letter, you will
  probably get the first letter of your name or maybe an S (or M).\r\n\r\nFor a while
  I had been thinking about making my own chocolate letter, or more specific, a pilcrow.
  I will not go into detail, but this week I finished the first batch and I thought
  I'd share it with you.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fabiobartali.wordpress.com/van-idee-tot-letter/pilcrow_04_chocolade_09/\"
  target=blank>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pilcrow_04_chocolade_09_4549.jpg]</a>\r\n\r\nYou
  can read about it (in Dutch) <a href=\"http://fabiobartali.wordpress.com/van-idee-tot-letter/\"
  target=blank>here</a>, or pictures of the process can be found <a href=\"http://fabiobartali.wordpress.com/van-idee-tot-letter/Pilcrow_01_3D_01/\"
  targt=blank>here</a>.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed doing this project and I'd like to hear what
  you think :)"
