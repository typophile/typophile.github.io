I&rsquo;m currently studying Futura font.
There&rsquo;s a question my teacher gave me,
Why is Futura created?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t seems to find the answer :(
And also, what do you think of Futura? What feels it gives you?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The previously mentioned book on Renner will answer your question, especially chapter four. If you don&rsquo;t feel like buying the book, email me and I&rsquo;ll get you some info. It&rsquo;s been several years since I read it, but if I remember correctly the creation of Futura had something to do with an alternative to the insistence on the use of blackletter forms by some segments of German society and evolution (for lack of a better word) of that style. It also reminds me of this comment by Wassily Kandinsky: &ldquo;Every work of art is the child of its age and, in many cases, the mother of our emotions. It follows that each period of culture produces an art of its own which can never be repeated. Efforts to revive the art-principles of the past will at best produce an art that is still-born. It is impossible for us to live and feel, as did the ancient Greeks. In the same way those who strive to follow the Greek methods in sculpture achieve only a similarity of form, the work remaining soulless for all time. Such imitation is mere aping. Externally the monkey completely resembles a human being; he will sit holding a book in front of his nose, and turn over the pages with a thoughtful aspect, but his actions have for him no real meaning.&rdquo;</div>

Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the References, Further Reading, and External links sections at the bottom of the page. Amongst their twenty-five references, there should be ample content to point you in the right direction (<a href="http://bit.ly/11PTcJn">the first page of Google results</a> also has some good sources).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>When I first saw the question of this thread, I thought it was unanswerable. There is no &ldquo;why&rdquo; in the sense that someone had a newspaper, and melting rubber rollers were causing the ink to smear (that&rsquo;s why Corona was created).</p>
<p>But why a font is created doesn&rsquo;t have to be an external cause. The artist could have had an intention in mind when creating it.</p>
<p>Many popular books on typography will give this for Futura: basically, Futura is based on basic geometric shapes, straight lines and circles, and it was intended by the type designer to break with precedent by creating a type face based on such principles. (There were other such faces from that period, such as Kabel - but Kabel and Futura are <em>very</em> different typefaces, even though they share this attribute.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Basically it was the zeitgeist of this period after world war 1.</p>
<p>Futura was titled »Schrift unserer Zeit« it means the type of our time. Futura was influenced by the bauhaus and neue sachlichkeit movements based on geometric shapes. Also there where lots of other such faces like Erbar Grotesk oder Kabel. They are all very geometric and share similarities but where still different in detail.</p>
