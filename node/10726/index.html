		<div class="commentbody">Times is actually one of my favourites. It is neutral, and lets the text content be in the focus.  And now I&#39;m not talking about the 12 point Linotype Times version that comes with most printers. It is too condensed and has too much contrast to work well as a body text face in my book. Take a look at Times Ten, Linotype&#39;s 10-point version, which is thicker, wider and has less contrast. Very good for body text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Morison never intended to create a stunning, beautiful typeface with Times New Roman. It was purposely made to be neutral and free from bells and whistles. There is a charm in that approach too, I think. I do like old classic typefaces like Jenson, though.  But it doesn&#39;t fit in every situation. Imagine a bill set in Adobe Jenson... <BR>There&#39;s a reason that Times is &#34;overused&#34;, not only the fact that it comes with printers. It is simply a good and versatile typeface &#40;as long as one doesn&#39;t use the 12-point version for body text that is&#41;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have to use Helvetica Condensed and Times for our corporate typefaces. I&#39;m sick of both. Times is flat, dead, unpleasant, and tricky to set in a manner that doesn&#39;t hark back to its intended use, which is &#40;of course&#41; not what we need it for. <BR> <BR>A close second for me is Gill Sans. There are a lot of unoriginal art directors out there working for big manufacturing companies, and they love their Gill. A lot of our work has to take on the look of our business partners, so we routinely work with a variety of &#39;identities&#39;. I&#39;d kill to work with faces like DIN or Minion on a regular professional basis, overused or not. <BR> <BR>I run into a lot of Adobe Garamond, but for some reason that doesn&#39;t bother me so much. ::shrug:: <BR> <BR>I think the reason that Times and TNR are so overused is a&#41; default b&#41; <i>free</i> c&#41; the apocryphal story about how it&#39;s the &#39;most legible&#39; typeface. <BR> <BR>TNR isn&#39;t terrible at face value, I just wish people would set type on long measures that was intended for long measures. Also, most people use 12 pt for the same reasons, it&#39;s the default. Plus, it makes their writing appear longer. I think the default should be set to Zapf Dingbats. Force people to make their own decisions and set up their own defaults. ::thumbs nose at Microsoft Office::</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Walter Tracey goes into this in depth in <i>Letters of Credit</i>. Basically, if I remember correctly, the proportions of Times New Roman were based off of an old &#40;original ?&#41; cut of Plantin. <BR> <BR>The bold, which was developed later by Monotype&#39;s drawing office &#40;without Morison?&#41; was designed so that each letter has the same width as the Regular. This is why the bold looks so terrible</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Another thing about the Bold is that it has vertical stress while the Regular&#39;s is oblique &#40;see the &#34;o&#34;&#41;. From what I understand this was a practical thing: the Bold was mainly intended for use for headings in The Times newspaper, and some people&#42; think vertical stress is better for news. <BR> <BR>&#42; Earlier this year JFP pointed out that many people report getting uncomfortable viewing fonts with oblique stress. I think this makes sense, although it&#39;s probably confined to deliberative reading; I think oblique stress probably improves immersive reading. Same thing with serif versus sans, btw. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
