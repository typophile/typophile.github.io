  typefaces Caledonia and Metro.\r\n\r\nBut today I encountered his name in quite
  another connection.\r\n\r\nIn junior high school, in the textbooks we used reflecting
  the \"New Math\", there was a reference to symbols for \"dek\" and \"el\", representing
  the duodecimal digits having the values of ten and eleven.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out,
  it was W. A. Dwiggins, who was also an advocate for the use of base-12 instead of
  decimal, who invented those symbols. Dek, the symbol for ten, is like a capital
  X, but with the upper left to lower right bar curling over outwards at the ends.
  El, the symbol for eleven, is an upside-down 3 (the style with a top like that of
  the 7)."
