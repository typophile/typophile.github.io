body: Hi. This is a logo Im working on for a local restaurant. It specialises in dishes
  that seem a bit cliche and kitsch &#40;hence the name&#41;, but are given a modern
  twist. To reflect this I am trying to create a 1950&#39;s reference in the identity
  i&#39;m creating, but I don&#39;t really know if the logo is working at the moment...
  any suggestions? what do you make of it? <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35329.gif"
  alt="kitschen logo">

  body: Your trying to make the logo do all the branding. Sometimes its better to
    go simplier. No one is going to get cliche and kitsch from a logo. The whole environment
    has to create that atmostphere. I haven&#39;t a clue of what that blob is at the
    left of your name. Also if you are looking for retro &#40;50s&#41; looking stuff
    for reference go to Font Dinner. Great typefaces and retro stuff and some free
    fonts.

  body: I have to say, I am a bit confused. What would my motivation be to eat in
    a cliche trashy looking restaurant?  <BR> <BR>Please redefine if I missed your
    point. <BR> <BR>When I think of Kitsch, I think of Home Shopping Network collectibles
    from 15 years ago. <BR> <BR>I guess its a one-time curiousity thing, or for kitsch
    enthusiasts. <BR> <BR>Andrew <BR>

  body: Shall I assume that the recent onslaught of restaurant logos are all from
    the same school assignment? <BR> <BR>Roh, in contrast to some of the other commentary
    on this thread, I kind of like the concept of a kitch restaurant, and further,
    I think the name is clever. Some restaurants have been bold enough to take the
    risk of exposing themselves for what they really are &#40;eg. Fat Burger&#41;.
    I don&#39;t see any problem, or deterent, for a restaurant to serve ordinary,
    regular, uninteresting, &#34;cliche&#34; or &#34;kitche&#34; food, on kitche dishes
    in a kitche environment. I might even visit a few times on those days when I&#39;m
    tired of everyone trying to keep up with the really cool trends and fads. It might
    be refreshing to experience honest poor quality

  body: Oh yah, I almost forgot. Lose the mark and focus on the logotype. The title
    is making a statement in itself, so emphasize that. The graphic is unnecessary.

  body: Scot find a picture of that sign in Indiana. I once saw a neon sign with some
    of the lights out. During the day it said Rugs and Broadlooms at night it said
    Rugs and Badlooms.
