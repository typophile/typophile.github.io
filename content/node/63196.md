  body: "Reminds me of the way lettering artists like the late Bob Alonso adapted
    classic fonts into something a bit less formal. His [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/wonka/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D124%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DTHE%2520OZONE%2520DILEMMA%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%252Csingle%26seed%3D24|Wonka]]
    doesn't match this, but it shows a similar curvature that adds dynamic energy
    to the lettering.\r\n\r\nThere is the same sort of quality to this lettering in
    your sample, and it makes me think we are looking for a display font, and not
    a weight of a classic serif family.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
