  a compositor, strips coming off a typositor... when type was  \u201Cspec'd\u201D
  and ordered from a type house. You might also recall the sample books supplied by
  those type houses. Is there a program that exists (for Mac) that can automatically
  load fonts from my system (presently catalogued in Fusion) and create an alphabetical
  one-line sample book?  I have nearly 6500 fonts in my database and it's time consuming
  to try to wade through Suitcase one click at a time when looking for a specific
  font. I'd much rather flip through a hard copy printout of my catalog. Does this
  software doesn't exist? If not, and you're a code writer, I think there's a market
  for it.  Thoughts?\r\n\r\nd\r\n "
