    body: "It's certainly not paying my rent, but I've had a pretty decent response.
      Last month I sold \xB130 copies. My type designing hobby isn't to make money,
      or to be noticed. That's why I sell it for a couple bucks. It ensures low sales,
      while maintaining a user base who will let me know how I can improve the font.\r\n\r\nNo,
      I didn't try to sell it to the lone rider guy. His interests are far from having
      custom type. But I have done this with other fonts that aren't up on my site."

  body: "Kyle, thanks for the details.\r\n\r\nI guess you're making type because you
    enjoy it. That's not a bad reason at all, but you might be able to afford to enjoy
    it more if you position it more shrewdly. For example I wonder whether offering
    the font to the Lone Rider guy for let's say $100 (maybe with a limited-time exclusivity,
    after which you could sell it retail) might have been better: you might have actually
    made less money (compared to the ~$60/month for the past few months) but you could
    showcase it as a custom job - which sounds much better than having yet another
    retail font out there.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
