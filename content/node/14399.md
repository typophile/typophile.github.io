    body: Yes I did. His site is helpful and I always go there first when trying to
      ID a script font. It is very valuable. However, some of the previews there are
      too small to see the fine detail necessary to id some fonts.

  body: David Rakowski long ago digitized Troubadour Light as <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/rakowski/dr5/davy_f5.htm"
    target="_blank">Rechtman</a>. He worked on and released his fonts in Mac format
    (and then PC conversions showed up). <a href="http://www.erik.co.uk/font/script.html"
    target="_blank">Here</a> is the original with documentation (no longer valid).
