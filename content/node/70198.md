  I really need to use old-style figures; I am not sure if the font comes with old-style
  figures or not?\r\nI see it sold on myfonts and fontshop\u2014I suppose it's best
  to buy OpenType.\r\nThis is my first time working with typography, so I am not sure
  how to go about finding out if old-style figures are included, or if not how to
  work them into the font etc.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nPeter."

    721\" is Bitstream's name for Plantin. Monotype's Plantin does have old style
