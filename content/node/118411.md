  1\r\nStylistic Alternatives 2\r\nSwash 1\r\nSwash 2\r\nTitling 1\r\nTitling 2\r\n\r\nCurrently

  Alternates\r\n.....................or could I?\r\n\r\nI would be missing\r\nStylistic
  2\r\nSwash 2\r\nTitling 2\r\nThey would only be accessible through the glyphs panel.\r\n\r\nIS
  THERE AN ALTERNATIVE OPTION or SOLUTION?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Do the sets interact much with one another? If you want the plaintext preserved,
    I think you're probably stuck with making a second font.\r\n\r\nBut if this is
    only for your own use, or for users who you can expect to follow specific instructions,
    you could pack your alternates into ligatures. Designate a few easily-accessed
    characters you won't really need (like  `~^) for \"ligature codes\" then make
    A.ss02 into grave_grave_A, or such."

  body: "Thanks for your suggestion.\r\nThe font will be available to purchase on
    various font shops, so it has to be right.\r\nI was thinking of doing another
    font with all the alternates in.\r\nIt's probably the easiest option, for me and
    users.\r\n\r\nI was also hoping that there might be a sneaky way, (or get someone
    else to do it, as I can't quite programme complex OTFeatures yet).\r\n\r\nI think
    the glyphs in Titling 2 are probably gonna have to take the chop, unless I do
    a whole new font.\r\nHmmmm. What to do. ?"

  body: Are any of them best described as intersections of two other features? For
    instance, is Titling 2 composed of Titling versions of the alternate forms in
    Stylistic Set 1? If so, it shouldn't be its own feature; it should be handled
    by those two features when they are both on. You just have to be mindful of the
    order of execution. Even if that's not strictly how they correspond, it is probably
    still reasonable to game it that way.

  body: "No, none of them are 'best described as intersections of two other features'.\r\n\r\nI've
    opted for a whole new 'ALT' version of the font.\r\nI can fit all the other alternative
    characters in Stylistic Alternates, and Swash now, as I've also removed the others
    that I may have had to put in Titling.\r\nIt was a far simpler solution for global
    OTFs to work across all Apps.... and another font for people to buy.\r\nSo it's
    a win-win.\r\n\r\nThanks"

    Word also offers yet another different set of features supported. sigh.\r\n\r\nSo
    really, you can't make all your features universally accessible. "
