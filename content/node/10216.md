  body: This is hand-drawn, you can see that the characters don&#39;t match. There
    are tons of fonts with this look, check out <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/cezanne-regular/"
    target="_blank">Cezanne</a> for one.

  body: Since Cezanne is &#40;in my opinion&#41; rather overused, you might consider
    an alternative like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-dearest/" target="_blank">P22
    Dearest</a>, or <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000104"
    target="_blank">Dear Sarah</a> from Veer.

  body: I&#39;d recommend Dear Sarah because it uses a lot of OpenType features that
    make it look hand-drawn &#40;if you are using an application that supports OpenType
    properly&#41;. <BR> <BR> - Lex
