    you're really interested in is the monumetal inscriptions in the background (which
    they hadn't even noticed).\r\n\r\nMy father's a geologist and as a child I heard
    my share of geological explanations when travelling on holiday with him. No mountain
    was just a mountain, no valley just a valley: there was always a very interesting
    fold in the rock, or evidence of an ancient glacier.\r\n\r\nI guess it's payback
    time \u2014 except my wife's the one who has to put up with my \"typocentric\"
    travelling habits."

    make their first letters and expressing themselves. You're right. I have two girls
    (one 11teen and one 9) and even though the youngest still writes most of her letters
    backwards, these scribblings are wonderful and I love seeing them (on most every
    blank surface in our house).\r\n\r\nHowever, seeing Toys R Us (R backwards) and
    WRAPS (R backwards) on the front of buildings makes me cringe. This is next to
    seeing stacked type on a banner, of course. OY!"
