  by Friedrich Forssmann in the recently published book \xBBArno Schmidt in Hamburg\xAB
  (Hoffmann und Campe, 978-3-455-40345-9, http://www.hoffmann-und-campe.de/go/arno-schmidt-in-hamburg).
  Screenshot from the publisher\u2019s homepage attached to this posting. I feel it\u2019s
  something between Garamond and Bembo, but what font exactly?\r\nThanks a lot in
  advance!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Looking at it more closely in a PDF of the book excerpt that you can download,
    I think the typeface is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/bembo_book_pro_complete_pack/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=65&sample_text=Arno%20Schmidt&ft=liga\">Bembo
    Book</a>. The font is called \u2018ZettelMZ-Regular\u2019, which might mean that
    Friedrich Forssman modified the original font for typesetting Arno Schmidt\u2019s
    novel <cite>Zettel\u2019s Traum</cite> (maybe adjusting kerning pairs or the like)
    and continues to use this version for publications about this author."

    for taking the time a giving some background information! I already had the suspicion
    that he would not adjust all those spaces by hand every time. Very unique and
    always recognizable appearance. I am not always sharing his opinion about legibility,
    but having some signature-quirks also has its attractions."
