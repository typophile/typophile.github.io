  body: "There is something strange going on with this font. According to the sample
    posted here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/105494\r\nthe |p| in the sample is different
    from the one in \"DF So Sho\".\r\n\r\nMore than that, there is a (free for personal
    use) font called <strong>Amano</strong> by Joan M. Mas [1999] which matches all
    letters in the sample (including |p|):\r\nhttp://www.whatfontis.com/Amano.font?text=Hydraulic%20sales%20-%20Service%20-%20Repairs\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure but I think Amano is not a clone, and Joan M. Mas is a legitimate designer:\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/person/Joan_Mas/\r\nso
    I decided to post this information.\r\nIf you think Amano is a clone, please tell
    me and I'll remove all information and links.\r\n\r\n(I can't explain what is
    going on. I don't think Joan M. Mas has any need to clone a pricey commercial
    Japanese font to create a handwriting font. I don't think also DynaComware Design
    Studio has any need to use a free handwriting font. Is it possible that Joan M.
    Mas worked for DynaComware Design in the past? I really don't know)."
