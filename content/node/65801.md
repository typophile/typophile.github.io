  the Doctor Who DVD menus (classic series). I've included 2 menu snapshots:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vlcsnap-00001_4805.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vlcsnap-00005_4300.png]\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: Yep, indeed -- I was just about to add the link to the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/eurostile_lt_pro_virtual/">OpenType
    version</a> -- the best option these days.

    single file format, can you? ;^)

  body: Mm, it annoys me as I am transitioning to OpenType mostly... but the DVD program
    I use only accepts TrueType. In any case, thank you for so quickly IDing that
    one for me. I have Eurostile around here somewhere. :)

  body: Okay, so I'm using Eurostile LT Demi and can't get the spacing to match. Is
    "Eurostile" different to "Eurostile LT" ?

  body: There are several digitisations of Eurostile available from various foundries,
    and they are bound to all be slightly different in design and spacing. Finding
    the exact version starting from your sample is nigh impossible, so your best bet
    is to manually adjust the spacing and tracking until you get the desired results.

  body: What Yves said. I believe "LT" stands for "Linotype", so that's just one foundry
    that has issued a version of Eurostile.

    whereas <strong>Lt</strong> stands for the typeface weight <em>Light</em>. For

  body: Sorry I've taken a while to respond, thank you however for your further info
    on the 'LT' and what that means. I've bookmarked that article to read through
    when I get the chance. I've since played around with the spacing on the version
    I have and can manage a suitable substitute. :)
