  book for my sophomore portfolio review and I'm trying to find distinguishing characters
  for twenty typefaces. I've been having some trouble finding information on some
  of the typefaces, so I turn it to you. I need at least 5 distinguishing characters
  for each, preferably in Roman or Regular, and why they distinguish the typeface.
  I'm thinking that I'm going to use Q in all of my designs, because almost every
  Q is different and special. I just need help with the why it is special and wording
  it appropriately.\r\n\r\nTypefaces I still need information for:\r\nITC Cheltenham\r\nBerkeley
  Oldstyle\r\nInterstate\r\nMinion\r\n\r\nand a few others I haven't researched just
  yet, so not sure if there is or isn't information. Will update accordingly."

  body: Does the larger x-height in the ITC version change the r? I know that cheltenham
    was handtooled, so did that have something to do with it?

    \"r\".\r\n\r\nBTW \"handtooled\" usually means the same as \"inline\", like this:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/cheltenham-handtooled/\r\nI'm
    not getting how that might be relevant...\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Anatomy-Type-Graphic-Typefaces/dp/0062203126\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
