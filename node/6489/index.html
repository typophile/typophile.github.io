<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>does anyone on the boards here in the chicago area ever meet up or have a little corner pub where they go to hang out, grab a drink and discuss typographic matters? is anyone currently collaborating on any projects in the chicago area or are planning to in the near future? by collaborative projects i'm thinking currently active workshops, collaborative typeface design etc...would love to hear about the status of any such things... <br> <br>best <br>w</div>

<div class=commentbody>that's really great! used to do something similar to that with a couple buddies from back at school...get together on a tuesday night down the street, have drinks and discuss whatever was on our mind...usually design and usually Bush. most everyone got too busy with jobs, life etc unfortunately. i'm just hoping there's some great workshops or collaboration going on because a little smack of creativity right now would be great. guess i'll just keep looking around with at least one open eye. thanks for the reply, dan <br> <br>best <br>w</div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe you could email Armit Vit from Speak Up. Even if he isn't a part of something in Chicago, he would probably know about it. He seems to be the don of young graphic designers there. <br> <br>In 2000 the AIGA chapter was at least semi-active</div>

<div class=commentbody>dan, currently i'm a working designer with an actual title of marketing designer at modern luxury publishing co. they do CS magazine here in chicago and a whole host of others in the Cali and in Texas with new titles launching. it's expanding like crazy and that equals fun because it's lots of random work as they don't have the total staff they need so it's always a variety of design and layout. <br> <br>before that i was a practicing freelancer in the chicago area...i was doing the usual stationary stuff but really had fun doing music venue posters. did that for about 2 years and am still doing it on the side when time permits. it's a great way to stay creative as most of my clients trusted my judgement over time. <br> <br>before THAT i was at school at ringling school of art and design in sarasota florida on the gulf coast (i think the gulf coast still exists?) their i was immersed in complete experimentation in anything i could get my hands on. mostly type, as my typographic teacher 4th year was edwin utermohlen who studied under ed fella. the guy was pure inspiration and fun as hell to grab a beer with from time to time. <br> <br>so in just about everything i do, it's my type i pay most attention to. for the most part when a logo project were to come up i'd work a hand drawn face up the would accompany a logo or mark...i just hated copping out and using something on the computer that sorta fit but didnt alot of the time. it just felt too easy and since i drew the mark in the first place it only made sense. since detail was of the essence, i just got really good over 2 years of doing detailed type sketches which lead to my ambitions of making typefaces...but it stems further back but i'm out of breath here... <br> <br>best- <br>will</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm in Chicago. I don't have a regular bar where I meet typographers -- but I've got a few regular bars. ;-) Ada's on Wabash when I'm downtown working; the Gold Star on Division when I'm on my way home and feel like pretending I'm hip. I'd be happy to meet a Typophile at either one. Or at any bar for that matter. <br> <br>If you're out and about tonight, I'll be at the Skylark (Halsted & Cermak) with some folks I teach with, getting our new boss hosed. <br> <br>I've been to a couple Future History conferences and they've been really good. I'm hoping to go this year, money permitting, since I've got some interest in the non-Latin stuff. <br> <br>And to any SOTA organizers who may be reading, I'm more than eager to help out if TypeCon makes it's way into the wasteland of northern Illinois. <br> <br>But now I have to pretend I'm getting some work done....</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nathan, we'll definitely take you up on your offer to help with a Chicago TypeCon. Will be cool to head back to the Midwest after the great reception we had in Minneapolis. <br> <br>Tijuana or another Latin American destination would be amazing. I would personally love to get TypeCon south of the border before the decade is over.</div>
