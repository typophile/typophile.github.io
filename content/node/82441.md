  thoughts on the face choice (and the relationship to the symbol), kerning, layout,
  etc is  I'm guessing some will comment on single color reproduction issues  on the
  graphic mark, but this was kinda thought about before going with this treatment.
  Thanks,\r\nM[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KodisIdent_5768.jpg]"

  body: reproduction of the mark is vital and "kinda thought about" isn't exactly
    what a client wants to hear. of two i prefer the top stacked version. bottom seems
    to get long. the 'o' and 'd' seems kinda tight. bottom text seems tight all around.
    horizontal balance seems tad bit off between mark and type. what's this for?

  body: "hi Hola,\r\nThanks for the feedback, appreciated. The client is an interactive
    designer, and art directed the mark - he wanted movement & overlapping geometric
    shapes interacting. The \"feeling evoked\" was the most important aspect for him;
    in the same way the nike swoosh evokes motion but is not a conceptual mark.  The
    mark reproduction is vital and I understand that, but for his business the primary
    application is digital and 4 color reproduction...I'm not sure this is much more
    difficult to reproduce than this identity by Pentagram. Thoughts?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grant_thornton_logo_6384.jpg]"

    get better at logo dev  (Slow going :)  Any feedback on the mark / type relationship
    in this version is much appreciated.   My first real attempt at hand kerning,
    so any comments are great.   Grid included on second image. I've been lurking
    the typophile font ident forums for quite awhile, have learned a tremendous amount.
    Just found the logo forum thanks to the above, cheers. Thanks in advance,\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/k2_6663.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/k2_grid_4162.jpg]"

  body: "digital reproduction is toss up or at least has been in the past. with the
    quality of new monitors & smartphones screens i think you'll be alright. 4 color
    vs 1 or 2 pms colors reproduction is always going to be a challenge. variable
    such as ink/paper/printers will challenge the consistency of color for sure. But
    that happens with everything.\r\n\r\nI also like the lower case option better,
    but like the openness of the type in the second option. Great mark by the way.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback guys, much appreciated. Yeah after talking with the
    client, I think we both agree that sentence case is the way to go. The last one
    is \"YELLING\",  and counteracting the friendliness of the mark.\r\n\r\n I also
    feel like besides loosening up the type on the first version, there is still a
    balance issue on the stack...the relationship between the mark and the type doesn't
    feel \"in the pocket\" so to speak.  Does anyone have any ideas on why this may
    be? (weight, size, leading, etc) \r\n\r\nI've tried a lot of faces and the one
    chosen has the right mix of square/ humanist feel to me (a lot of square sans
    feel really harsh). Not sure how Pentagram can set Univers, making it look so
    classic (in the grant thorton example) - when I set it with my mark, it seems
    to look dated. (Ha)  \r\n\r\nAny other insight in pushing this to the next level
    is really appreciated. Thanks guys for taking the time :)\r\n"
