  that would be great. international was the hardest to trace![img:sites/default/files/old-images/medic_5159.png]

  body: "Scala Sans is the closest match I can come up with:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-scala-sans/\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I suspect the reason why What the Font didn't produce a good match is that the
    type has been manually narrowed. It looks familiar, but doesn't match any of the
    common sans serifs with multiple weights.\r\n\r\nInternational is too small to
    make an accurate ID."

  body: "\"Medic\"/\"Florid\" must be an <strong>[[http://opti.netii.net/fonts-p/index.htm|OPTI
    Phillip-Bold / OPTI Phillip-Medium]]</strong> combination - probably manually
    compressed.\r\nThe original font (according to opti page) is <strong>Arnholm Sans</strong>
    but I can't find any digital version of it.\r\n\r\n\"INTERNATIONAL\" also looks
    like a manually expanded version of <strong>OPTI Phillip-Medium</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Warning!</strong>:
    When using OPTI/Castcraft fonts, be careful about quality and legibility issues,
    especially when you need a license for a commercial project. You can read more
    about Castcraft here:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/fonts-27506.html"

  body: Amazing fvilanakis! You got it!!! What do you mean by its manually compressed?
    I have to transform the letters a bit? I think you're right because its not the
    kerning thats wrong. May I ask how you were able to identify it?

  body: "Yes, you have to transform the letters a bit, reduce the width to make them
    look condensed (another unofficial term is to \"squeeze them\"). In case of \"INTERNATIONAL\"
    you have to expand them i.e. increase the letter's width.\r\n\r\nAs Bob said,
    I'm the software engineer behind <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com|Find my Font]]</strong>
    application. Find my Font identifies the fonts of an image, either fonts you have
    on your PC or fonts included in our Online Database.\r\nOPTI/Castcraft is not
    yet in our online database but we'll add it at approximately 15 days (on our next
    major font-database update)."
