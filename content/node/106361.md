body: "I have found a bug in MS Word 2013. I do not know to whom should I contact
  so I am posting it here. If any Microsoft guy happened to came across it they may
  check it. I am also attaching a docx file containing the same text in Arab Typesetting
  font, as well as in free Scheherazade font and Adobe Naskh medium font, so their
  team can check it quickly. \r\n\r\nThis bug was not present in Word 2010. The image
  shows the bug that how digits placement is disturbed over certain Arabic signs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Word

  body: Office files contain no font. You could send a Word file in which you use
    Geronimo, Trinity or any H&FJ font without breaching any EULA. If the receiver
    does not have the font installed on his system, a fallback font is used to display
    and print  (without any warning). The same holds for PowerPoint  files.

  body: "> The same holds for PowerPoint files.\r\n\r\nFonts can be embedded in PowerPoint
    files, if you choose to do so, but only if you're using the PC version; the Mac
    version doesn't permit that."
