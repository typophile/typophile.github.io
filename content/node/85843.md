body: I'm now in Reading starting the one-year MATD course, and just in case anyone's
  interested in following my progress, I've started a blog over on Tumblr. <a href="http://ohbendy.tumblr.com/">A
  Year of Type Design</a> will chart the excitement and challenges of my studies.

    to resources (although, not necessarily all the coursework itself ;-). \r\n\r\nEnjoy
    yourself and milk it for all it\u2019s worth!"

  body: Thanks! I'm gonna figure out how to get a nicer Tumblr theme. Yeah, the workload
    is going to be huge, I just hope I don't get completely submerged and have no
    time to blog.

    probably not be your primary concern. <8-)

    write a blog post about that, as I want to do justice to the idea before offering
    it for critique. \r\n\r\nChris, thank you! :)"

  body: "Thinking about your method more deeply, I realize that a good way to see
    it is as ligating the limen - the border between black and white (noting that
    type design is essentially liminographic). This is in contrast to Legato, which
    attempts to ligate black and white in parallel.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
