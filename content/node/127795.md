  but from what font? Maybe it came from the font used in the 2nd line??\r\n\r\nThe
  2nd line... contains a C that seems modified, taking from the logo, but the other
  characters are from?\r\n\r\n[SELF FOUND - AVENIR NEXT LT PRO] The 3rd line\r\n\r\nThe
  4th line is different as seen from the R, C & O."
