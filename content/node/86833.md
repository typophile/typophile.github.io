body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am trying to replicate the main body font style shown at this
  website http://mediatemple.net/ but I am doing it in photoshop text with (no antialiasing).\r\n\r\non
  my computer this webpages text is rendered like this:\r\nhttp://gyazo.com/dcda9166b97bdc41afc8a1f27a42e53f.png\r\n\r\nAnd
  in the webpages code for this text it shows:\r\n16px \"Lucida Grande\", \"Lucida
  Sans Unicode\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\r\n\r\nNow I have all the fonts there
  on my computer, but when I am in photoshop and trying to replicate this font it's
  just not the same (Lucida Grande is very close but MT's is a lot cleaner).\r\n\r\nI'm
  new to special webfonts or anything like that, not entirely sure what is going on
  here.\r\n\r\nAny help would be great\r\n"

  body: Your web browser uses another rendering engine than Photoshop. This might
    be why you see differences. Can you show us what's happening in PS?

  body: The extra weight in Jan's image is due to a rendering bug in Firefox (?) when
    rendering light text on a dark background.

  body: "Hi guys this is what I had in photoshop (the bottom one) without any antialiasing.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/47701d4d096f716e7be2859ccd19eebc_4136.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
    I think I have worked it out, as soon as I tried this with (sharp) antialiasing,
    its pretty much identical to what I see in the webpage, so as Frode Frank says
    I guess what this is telling me is that there is some slight rending going on
    in my browser, and that it's not just a pixel font.\r\n\r\nI guess I've got to
    research some more about webpage font rendering/@fontface clear type, that sort
    of thing. "

  body: "also guys talking about Lucida Grande, what version of the font is this?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/00lucidaversion1_5343.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
    slightly different to the Lucida Grande I have, and I have tried back to backing
    Lucida Sans Unicode and plain Lucida Sans.\r\n\r\nWhatever this version is it
    seems a little bit more open and smoother, simpler in its forms. The M has a wider
    base, e and a's are more rounded and open.\r\n\r\nAny help would be great"
