body: After doing some pixel typefaces (that I still need to post here) I wanted to
  do another display font. The idea behind it was to make a bubblegum version of Babyteeth.
  Since I decided to make it a monotype font there are also some Mojo influences -
  although less obvious. So far I've done both a regular and a highlighted version
  with accompanying dingbats. Since it's named after my birthyear, I've tried to use
  dingbats that represent that time (the 'pacman-ghost' is obviously ahead of its
  time ;-p ) although I'm not too sure whether I succeeded at that. Either way, I'm
  quite pleased with the outcome & I hope you'll enjoy it!

  body: "After reading what influenced you I did not think I would like this face
    at all, but it is really nice. \r\n\r\nObviously, as the typeface shrinks there
    will be some legability issues, but it wouldn't be used very small. My guess is
    that the E, N, Q and T are going to give you the most difficulty (I thought the
    T was a Q at first glance).\r\n\r\nI like the bottom set of letters a lot better,
    they seem much more bubblegummy.\r\n\r\nThe Super Mario Bros. flowers are really
    nice touch."

  body: "Oops, I guess it shows I played Mario Bros one too many times ;-)\r\nI can
    imagine my inspiration sources are not the best description for the font, but
    they did play a large part in designing it.\r\nI totally agree with you on the
    bubblegum comment although I do like some dingbats better in the 'normal' version
    (e.g. the 8- & 12-pointed star). I think this version also solves a little of
    the legibility issue. But like you said; the font is only to be used for large
    texts and preferably even only for single words.\r\nThe problem with distinguishing
    several letters prompted me to make a different Y. I actually prefer the alternative
    Y (which is closed at the top), but realize it might get easily confused with
    the T. I'll probably end up using the 'closed' Y anyway in the assumption most
    letters will be recognized within the words they spell.\r\nOh, and thanks for
    your comment, I've been waiting a while now to get my first comment on this font
    ;-)\r\n"
