  CS4 compatibility. We work mainly with InDesign, so I'd like to ask you guys if
  I can just save a document in .indd from CS3 and open it in CS4 right away. And
  of course saving it in CS4 and opening it in CS3. \r\n\r\nI realize this may be
  a hard question since the software ain't out yet, but someone could have read about
  this somewhere else.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to know any other compatibility issues
  between these two, don't hesitate on telling me.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    you can open a CS3-doc in CS4), but NOT downwards (eg you can not directly open
    a CS4-doc in CS3, but have to export a file in the IDX-format to open it in the
    lower version, one step at a time \u2014 from CS4 to CS3 works, but not to CS2
    \u2014 you have to re-export in CS3).\r\nChances are that the new version works
    likewise.\r\nIt has to do with new features being introduced in new versions that
    will not translate well to the older ones.\r\n\r\nI may be not correct, but this
    was what I understood from the demo I attended.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

    documents for earlier versions. Apparently Adobe have ironed out a few glitches
    and the CS4 .inx-formats will be more robust."
