  Trajan but I am puzzled by the R - have not seen many swashes on upright characters.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wagnersymphonyrg7_6288.jpg]"

    know the R in question but you''ll find a similar in Nero BQ as mentioned or <a

  body: "The R from Mason Serif is a good spotting, but regrettably the '\xD6' from
    that typeface uses diamonds rather than circles (and also their is a minimal and
    less important difference as to the 'E' which above seems to have a tiny downwards
    serif on the middle stroke). \r\n\r\nAny more suggestions?"

  body: I didn't suggest Mason Serif as a match, only that the R is similar to the
    one in your sample above. I still think that it's Trajan Bold with an altered
    R...
