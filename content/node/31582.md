body: "Raising the Em dash question yet again. \r\n\r\nI generally set the em dash
  tight. Recently, a text I'd sent to our translation services came back with comments
  to space them em dashes. I am wondering if this is language-specific (like spaces
  before colons) or the translator has donned her typographer hat. I'm tempted to
  ignore the corrections, but first I would like to get a sense of em dash use in
  French texts from the francophones out there. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nKristina"

  body: 'I''m not a real francophone, but grabbing a small sample of French books
    from different publishers off the shelf by my computer, I found the following:
    one has em dashes set off by thin spaces, three have en dashes set off by word
    spaces, one has en dashes set off by thin spaces, and one has en dashes set off
    by word spaces on the outside only (i.e., the side away from the text being enclosed).
    These are all from France, though; Canadian usage might have more anglophone influence.'

    right nearby. I'll check there first.\r\n\r\nAs I said elsewhere my job requires
    me to set and edit French more often these days. Hyphenation rules are another
    source of frustration for me, but I do have a photocopy of guidelines provided
    by the translation office. I'm sure that with a few more reference books I could
    contribute less to the translator's headaches... :)\r\n\r\nThank you everyone!\r\nK."

  body: ":) WOW\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nMarc: Hyphenation breaks in French are different
    from English. But mostly, in English, I can look up a word in the dictionary,
    and the hyphanation is indicated. There's no guessing involved. As I understand
    it, French relies on syllables, pronounciation and other factors, which make it
    a little iffy for me to get right. I have yet to find a French dictionary that
    shows the breaks.\r\n\r\nChrisL: Somewhat ashamed. I played with that feature
    once, albeit very briefly. However, I usually hyphenate manually, and only in
    places. But mostly, I really wasn't sure how it worked. Does the language apply
    to selected text or to the document as a whole? Often I have both languages in
    one document. To be honest, I was too lazy to figure it out. ... I'd rather know
    the rules than rely on the software, anyway. ;) (That's my story, and I'm sticking
    to it!)\r\n\r\nI hyphenate in English manually, too, and check each break in my
    Canadian Oxford. (And yes, I also search my hyphens.)\r\n\r\nLinda: Thanks for
    the extra references.\r\n\r\nK."

    sheets that are language specific. You can apply some spaciong preferences in
    that way as well. You can make a character style for space emdash space that trcks/kerns
    the space to what you want. Then you can search and replace the text string \"space
    emdash space\" with same string and apply character style with adjusted spacing
    to all French text.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Marc: \r\n\r\nBecause it contains more than just the italics as a style.
    For example, I had a paragraph style for first paragraph of text, which was not
    indented and included oldstyle figures and a nested style with the first 4 words
    in small caps. Every following paragraph was the same, but indented and no small
    caps. With one click in the paragraph, I could format the whole thing, including
    the italics, and not have to worry about selecting text. I've used character styles,
    for example, to create the nested small caps style at the beginning of the first
    paragraph. But mostly I use paragraph styles so they carry all the information,
    including space before, paragraph rules, etc.\r\n\r\nK.\r\n"
