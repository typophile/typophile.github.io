  refresher on the basic principles of design. So I'm looking for a book. I do a lot
  of editorial, so I'm looking for a book that will explain and dissect good page
  layouts and explain why they work, using the principles of design (contrast, texture,
  balance, rhythm, etc\u2026). I'm looking for real-world examples, not just shapes
  on a page like Wucius Wong's Principles of Form and Design (a good book nonetheless).
  I'm not really looking for a grid book, however i realize that grids and page layouts
  are inseparable. \r\n\r\nAnyone know of any books that covers this? Or even a website,
  or magazine article?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    individual issues about page layout or consider the books they released. John
    McWade always works based on real-world examples and uses a fine technical approach.\r\n\r\nFor
    a more theoretical stuff, there is Bringhurst's <em>The Elements of Typographic
    Style</em>. A classical, although I think it is very conservative when talking
    about page formats, white space and dimensions."

    several short articles about some aspect of design. There are several sample issues
    you can download for free. He also has several books. '

  body: "I found this recent mag, [[http://www.myfavouritemagazines.co.uk/computer-arts-presents-software-skills-indesign/|Pro
    Software Skill: Indesign]], from the Computer Arts team pretty helpful. It's focus
    is, naturally given the title, InDesign but for the cover price it is a decent
    refresher.\r\n\r\nNot sure if you can get it off the shelf in Canada but you should
    be able to obtain it by mail order."
