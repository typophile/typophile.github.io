  heavy, lots of equations mixed into editorial, etc. Kind of new to me, so was wondering
  if anyone had seen some nice examples of typography in this realm. Could use a little
  inspirado.\r\n\r\nPreemptive thanks."

  body: As far as I know, most mathematical texts are written in a program called
    LaTex, which I understand is something like an old-fashioned, clumsy xml-like
    programming language designed to create nice an exact typography out of math.
    Whether or not it is something you want to use, I don't know ...

  body: "I have been using LaTeX for years. We use it instead of InDesign or Quark
    for the full text, not just for the equations. For someone working with InDesign,
    and needing really heavy mathematics, LaTeXit might be usefull. It comes  with
    <a href=\"http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/\"><strong>MacTeX 2009</strong></a>.
    Here is the equation that you see in John Hudson's very nice talk to be found
    <a href=\"http://river-valley.tv/scholarly-types/\"><strong>here</strong></a>
    (starting 27:43). That qualifies as heavy mathematics.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/latexit_3975.jpg]\r\nThe
    middle pane tells LaTeX to use the amsmath package and fourier, which is a mathematical
    font based on Utopia (which comes installed with MacTeX 2009). The lower pane
    contains the commands that give the equations.\r\n\r\nTo get the equation in InDesign,
    I had to save it as pdf outline, open it with Adobe Illustrator and then paste
    in InDesign. If you have just two or three of these, it might be a choice. For
    \"in line\" equations, i.e. equations in the text itself, I have no idea how to
    do it with InDesign.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n"

  body: "Concerning LaTeXit and InDesign, here is what I found.\r\n\r\nIf in LaTeXit,
    you select \"File > Export image...\" and then choose \"PDF vector image\", give
    some .pdf name to your file, say eqn1.pdf, save it, and then in InDesign select
    \"File > Place...\" and choose eqn1.pdf, you get your equation right where you
    are typing (I think you need to select \"View > Overprint preview...\" to see
    it properly, I am no InDesign expert). You can then adjust the formula box so
    that nothing is cut out and the formula aligns well with the text. More than that,
    if you wish to modify the formula, you can right click on it in InDesign, select
    \"Edit original\" and that will lauch LaTeXit on that formula with all the settings
    preserved. You edit it, LaTeXit, export it again (overwriting the previous file)
    and when you are back in InDesign, you click on the formula and it is updated.
    \r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with LaTeX formulas, you can use the online equation
    editor\r\n\r\nhttp://www.codecogs.com/components/equationeditor/equationeditor.php\r\n\r\nto
    get your LaTeX equation and then paste it in LaTeXit (you could also simply use
    the pdf given by the equation editor, if one of the fonts they provide suits you).\r\n\r\nMichel "

  body: TeX, in all its varieties and flavors (including LaTeX), seems too much like
    old-fashion markup. I've typeset science journals and engineering texts with hundreds
    of equations each and found that MathType (from Design Science) is easy to learn
    and use, has good support, and is not a super-pricey option. I like the control
    it gives over the look of equations and recommend it. (I am NOT affiliated in
    any way with Design Science or MathType.) As a book designer it is still my first
    choice for tpesetting math.

  body: "Marc,\r\n\r\nI see what you mean. I actually tried xeLaTeX with fontspec,
    polyglossia, Arno Pro scaled=1.05, the <a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/minionpro/\"><strong>MinionPro</strong></a>
    package with the onlymath option and some text with a mixture of smallcap polytonic
    greek (from the <a href=\"http://archimedespalimpsest.net/Supplemental/ArchimedesTranscriptions/\"><strong>Archimedes
    palimpsest</strong></a> which is a copy of a text that dates back to a period
    where miniscule Greek letters did not exist), some mathematics and the like, just
    for fun, and the result looked promising. You just made me realize that if I add
    $Q\\text{Q}$ to my trial text, I get a Q in Minion and then a Q in Arno in my
    formula. I am not sure I would like to rely on <code>\\text{}</code> or the like
    for full formulas though. The letters is math fonts need to be easily distinguishable
    outside of any context and that is not true of standard fonts. Also, the nice
    tail of the Arno Q might clash with lower indices. Those letters were not meant
    for mathematics.\r\n\r\nMichel"
