  to find some advice from all the typophiles here. I'm looking for a more modulated,
  humanist sans face similiar to Leviathan from HFJ. I do however need the typeface
  to come in a variety of weights which Levaithan doesn't. I guess another criteria
  for this face is that it could almost look like a font used for the headlines of
  old newspapers. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100015"
