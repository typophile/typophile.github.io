  body: "Hey, I\u2019m not knocking the redesign, just pimping my font :-)\r\nIt\u2019s
    a comparison for consideration.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, I like the way Ms Hische
    has made the ascender of /h longer.\r\nI made all Handsome\u2019s extenders and
    caps pretty much the same height, to clean up paragraph setting with no or minimal
    leading.\r\n\r\nShe opened up the loop of /p, whereas my philosophy was to not
    worry, again targeting longer text settings where various thickening of stems
    occurs.\r\n\r\nI also like the way she has differentiated the counters of the
    capitals from those of the lower case, and harmonized the proportions of the capitals
    with one another.\r\n\r\nThe nuances are tuned to the particular letter sequence
    in the wordmark, which doesn\u2019t happen in a typeface.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A bit less lively and individual, overall. The h is less cramped, but less
    interesting. And I prefer the original M, it was more easy-going, less school-like.
    I do like the way the loops have been opened up, though. But now it\u2019s ambivalent:
    is it one word with an intercap or two words? The obvious question is: Was it
    necessary? I don\u2019t see the point, myself.\r\n"
