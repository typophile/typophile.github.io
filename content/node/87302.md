    thefinalfontier has only 1 post on his track and it was made at 1h old. Ryuk is
    >4 years old but when you track him, his name doesn\u2019t appear in any of the
    threads it says (s)he\u2019s participated in\u2026"

  body: "How on earth does one embed a link in the source code? I know how to view
    it, but embedding it seems like a ridiculous way to elicit feedback. I haven\u2019t
    seen that done in over 5 years. Probably for good reason."

  body: "As I can see, the > img < tag is one of the allowed formatting options.\r\nThe
    user embedded the image in the post to be displayed normally,\r\nbut -it might
    be- that the s10.postimage.org site is not allowing hot-linking, \r\ntherefore
    the image becomes invisible and you can only view the URL if you examine the page
    source.\r\n"

  body: "No bots, I think you're right fvilanakis! It must be that no hot-linking
    is allowed.\r\n\r\nI'll try it again.\r\n\r\nhttp://img.emol.com/2011/11/10/File_2011111023140.jpg\r\n\r\nSo
    far Ryuk is winning with Futura Demi"
