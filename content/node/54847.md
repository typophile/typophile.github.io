  chose R because I found a laRge pictuRe of Roses I could use as an anchoR foR smalleR
  pictuRes. I have asymmeRical negative space, of couRse. The composition is set up
  so that the smalleR objects pouR out of the Rose vase. I used this pictuRe with
  no flash because I liked the oRange, antique glow and I liked how it was a bit bluRRy
  and old looking."
