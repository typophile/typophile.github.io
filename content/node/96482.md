  body: "Excellent for alot of Logo uses. I would be very interested in using it (and
    show end result with testimonial)\r\nI love the fluent look, I think it would
    be right for a WebApp I'm ready to start designing within the next 2wks - http://NFOPic.com\r\n\r\nFeel
    free to contact me anytime via Twitter if you would like some Designers to show
    off some creativity of Forrst.me ETC.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJayism\r\n@OpenDevs"
