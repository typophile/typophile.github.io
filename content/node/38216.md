  body: "thank you very much gustavo.\r\nYou can tell him that it's for an artist
    book, a kind of big monographic catalog.\r\nIf you want to see what he's doing
    just write jordi colomer in google and you'll find many things. I'm new here but
    I think it's the begining of a long story.\r\n\r\nbest\r\nhenri"
