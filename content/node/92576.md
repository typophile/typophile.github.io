    can be accomplished with the <strong>calt</strong> feature.\r\n\r\nAs I understand
    it (which I may not, and amendment will surely follow), text strings within brackets
    are processed and/or recognized sequentially, so\u2014instead of a line of code
    for every glyph\u2014you could use code like this:\r\n<code>sub [ a b c d e f

  body: Yes init and fina seem to be exactly what im looking for. Researching them
    has led to more confusion however. Looks like I need to make 2 substitution tables.
    I have no idea how to do that.  Moreover I can't find anything on what the code
    would actually look like, or how to go about doing all this in fontlab.

  body: "Ok, Im advancing myself a little farther down this rabbit hole:\r\nVery hard
    to find actual examples of opentype code online.\r\nLots of sites describing its
    capabilities, and a few sites that list all its \"features\" aka methods,\r\nbut
    very little actual code examples.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this is what I want, though
    I haven't been able to get it to work:\r\n\r\n\r\n@LETTERS = [ < all letters in
    the font that could be part of a word>];\r\n\r\nfeature clig {\r\nlookup BEGIN_WORD_LIGS
    {\r\nignore @LETTERS @LETTERS'; # will match any word glyph preceeded by another
    word glyph.\r\nsub c t by c_t.begin; # you know that there is no word glyph before
    the 'ct' sequence.\r\n};\r\n\r\nlookup END_WORD_LIGS {\r\nignore @LETTERS' @LETTERS;
    # will match any word glyph followed by another word glyph.\r\nsub o f f by o_f_f.end;
    # you know that there is no word glyph after the 'off' sequence.\r\n};\r\n} clig;
    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI get that they are addressing a class with the @LETTERS, but
    did they have to create this class through fontlab somehow, as in a new set of
    glyphs? That is, is it or is it not being substantiated in the actual code itself?
    \ And why isn't Fina or Init being used here?  Is Lookup an actual built-in function,
    or \"feature\", or just what the author chose to name this function right here
    in this example?"

    new set of glyphs?\"\r\n\r\nNew glyphs? Presumably not: the whole point was to
    reference all existing letter glyphs in the font.\r\n\r\n> That is, is it or is
    it not being substantiated in the actual code itself? \r\n\r\nYes, there needs
    to be code for it. There are no built-in classes in FontLab or OpenType.\r\n\r\n>And
    why isn't Fina or Init being used here? \r\n\r\nThat's a question for the person
    who wrote the code. If it were me, my most likely reason to avoid 'init' and 'fina'
    would be poor app support. Even InDesign, which does support these features, contradicts
    the OpenType spec by not having them on by default. I lobbied hard to get them
    supported, but couldn't get them on by default.  :(\r\n\r\n> Is Lookup an actual
    built-in function, or \"feature\", or just what the author chose to name this
    function right here in this example?\r\n\r\nThe concept of a lookup is fundamental
    to OpenType itself. The AFDKO feature language supports it directly for those
    cases where a lookup needs to be explicitly handled for some reason. Your feature
    code will otherwise create one lookup per OT feature where it is not explicit."

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI just found a simple and elegant solution to the problem of targeting
    beginning- or ending-of-word letters. It is based on the example provided in the
    [[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#5.f.ii|
    Adobe's specs]] : \r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfeature cswh {\r\n# --- Glyph classes used
    in this feature:\r\n@BEGINNINGS = [A-N P-Z Th m];\r\n@BEGINNINGS_SWASH = [A.swsh-N.swsh
    P.swsh-Z.swsh T_h.swsh m.init]; @ENDINGS = [a e z];\r\n@ENDINGS_SWASH = [a.fina
    e.fina z.fina];\r\n\r\n# --- Beginning-of-word swashes:\r\nignore substitute @LETTER
    @BEGINNINGS'; \r\nsubstitute @BEGINNINGS' by @BEGINNINGS_SWASH;\r\n\r\n# --- End-of-word
    swashes:\r\nignore substitute @ENDINGS' @LETTER; \r\nsubstitute @ENDINGS' by @ENDINGS_SWASH;\r\n}
    cswh;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nBut this example does not work if applied to a single
    letter (at least in FontLab, the only place where I tested it for now). It seems
    that exclusion rules (<em>ignore substitute</em>) are cumulative. So first letters
    would be correctly replaced, but then the second rule will be limited to single-letter
    words (i.e. without a letter before - rule 1 - AND without a letter after - rule
    2).\r\n\r\nA simple solution to this problem is to isolate each rule into a dedicated
    lookup block :\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nlookup beginning_s {\r\n\tignore sub @ALL_LETTERS
    s';\r\n  sub s' by s.starting;\r\n} beginning_s;\r\n\r\nlookup ending_s {\r\n\tignore
    sub s' @ALL_LETTERS;\r\n  sub s' by s.ending;\r\n} ending_s;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I did not tested using classes exactly as in the example, maybe the fact of using
    classes instead of single glyph also isolates contexts.\r\n\r\nHope this will
    help with this common issue, there are very little resources available on this
    topic.\r\n\r\nFred."

  body: Ok I just tried with the exact same technique as in the specs, and it doesn't
    work in FontLab. So the 'lookup' trick seems to be the safer way to accomplish
    that.
