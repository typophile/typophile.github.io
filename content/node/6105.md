  body: <i>&#34;shame on me i know&#34;</i> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s good that you said it
    before us. <BR> <BR>Sorry, we do not help to locate copies of fonts that have
    been renamed. We encourage the use of the original fonts, unless there is no other
    known digital version &#40;my personal rule&#41;. <BR> <BR>It is better to ask
    somewhere else for this type of question. It is best to buy the proper font.
