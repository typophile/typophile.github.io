  of that name, all the serifs are straight, not cut like this is. Any ideas? Has
  it been hacked to look like this?\r\n\r\nThe TE is what I need, and from cropping
  a screenshot, I got the SLAB BLOCK - Which doesn't even really look like the TE...\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    for!\r\n\r\nWhat website calls what 'Slab Block'?\r\n\r\nYou say that you need
    'The TE' - but it would appear that you already have it. At least a functional
    image. Are you looking for a font that has letters like that?  What screenshot
    did you crop and what did you do with it?\r\n\r\n - Herb"
