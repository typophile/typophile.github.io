body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Foundries]] : Volcano Type</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Volcano
  Type</strong> is a independent font foundry based in Karlsruhe, [[Germany]].\r\n\r\nThe
  first course: a fast food youthfulness that was served for the first time in 1996.
  An earthy dish, created by chance, with thirteen organic fonts. Quickly whisked
  up and devoured. It rarely took more than a few days from sketch to use/digestion
  by the project. Uncouth forms, erupted from the bowels of the earth. Shattered letters,
  branded, stressed, humiliated. In order to produce arrogant fonts, far too expressive
  to last on a page of copy text. Quite indisputably from nature. Still roughly hewn.
  Raw. Imperfect.\r\n\r\nThe second course formed a strong contrast: tight concept,
  linear work, disciplined preparation. In most cases the font was formed by a matrix.
  Digital cool, sober, reduced. Plenty of free scope, like chess: the board is always
  the same, the moves always different. Classic openings are followed by unfamiliar
  variants. Competitive games. Finely nuanced movements. Carefully thought out, one
  masterminded brainchild after another.\r\n\r\nDessert: mathematical severity is
  rounded off and smoothed down. Fonts between digital and analogue. Straightened
  rivers - the surfaces of our times.\r\n\r\nCoffee & Cigarettes: a journey through
  metropoles all around the globe and a interdisciplinary book project, reflecting
  the cultural sampling, crossing and mixing. Many designers contributed with experimental
  fonts and font families to the <a href=\"http://www.bastard-project.com/\" target=\"_blank\">BASTARD</a>
