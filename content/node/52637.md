body: "I\u2019m trying to plan a workflow that will allow me to build out a mega family
  leveraging interpolation and macros. My plan would use Superpolator to interpolate
  and Font Remix to generate additional masters that can be fed into Superpolator.
  Does the following workflow makes sense?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Design the ultralight, regular
  and bold weights\r\n\u2022\_Use Superpolator to interpolate light and semibold and
  extrapolate super\r\n\u2022 Manually tweak the regular into a book weight \r\n\u2022
  Create an MM font and tweak it into a black weight with Remix\r\n\u2022 After working
  out the design of condensed and extended widths, create masters by using Remix to
  do the heavy lifting, finish the work manually, then use Superpolator to interpolate
  the additional weights"

    but if I did I thought I should design the extremes and then interpolate the weights
    between.\r\n\r\nRr"

  body: "How functional linear interpolation will be, will depend a lot on the nature
    of the design, and how extreme your heaviest weight is. Is this serif or sans?
    In what general style? What kind of thick/thin contrast?\r\n\r\nIf you're using
    Superpolator, why build an MM *afterwards*? Or, if you're building an MM, why
    use Superpolator for interpolation first?\r\n\r\nNote that I've never used Superpolator,
    just seen it demonstrated, so my questions may reflect my own ignorance of how
    it interacts with MM tech.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    for jumping from Superpolator back to MM, I would need an MM font to use Remix,
    not because I actually want to do much MM interpolation. I could probably do the
    same stuff with Glyph Tweaker and Interpolated Nudge, but I think Remix would
    probably do a better job of simultaneous narrowing and thickening."

    Tim's Font Remix tools and have found the latter to be better suited for this
    task (narrowing/thickening). I think this may be one of its real strengths. As
    for your wider plan, I'm a little confused but I'm all for trying things!"

    extent, an excuse to experiment with process."

  body: I'd say, worry first about getting your g right. Making a superfamily is a
    pointless exercise in complexity until you've got A-z perfect. All you'll be doing
    is proliferating errors. Here you've got the classic problem of a glyph design
    that, light, just might print well at 8 points, but that, bold, will certainly
    clog. Do you redesign the character to something that interpolates more successfully,
    or do you change the design more radically, and uninterpolably, as weight progresses?
    Use a lot of paper!

    glyph set, in FontLab. I think maybe you should let go of your feelings for tools
    and let the force be with you. Translated that means: Draw your thin, regular
    and fat, extra compressed thin, regular and fat, extra extended thin, regular
    and fat \u2014\_until each of those nine works using whatever tools help your
    eyes. Then find the common point structure, if you have not already, then make
    more styles.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "James, don't forget what normal MM inter/extrapolation in FL can do. Some
    of the things you describe can simply be done with FontLab's \"Generate Instance\"
    or \"Assign Mask\" commands.\r\n\r\nOf course, Superpolator and Remix Tools have
    their special superpowers but for ordinary (global, isotropic) inter/extrapolation
    the results of MM/FontLab's tools will be identical."
