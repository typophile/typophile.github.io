    Any hints from others?"

    I've checked both [[Dalton Maag]]'s and [[FontSmith]]'s websites, but couldn't
    find it. It's not from [[Nick Cooke]]'s [[G-Type]] foundry neither. :^/

  body: "<em>\"Ooooooooh, nice one , Mike! Brilliant ID.\"</em>\r\n\r\nThanks, Yves,
    but it was really solved by a tool.  All I did was use the a, b, and e in the
    <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif Font
    ID Guide</a> and pick it out of a visual lineup of 28 fonts that had those features.
    It's my 'secret weapon' for Serif fonts. It's a bit tricky to use, because the
    12 key letters are not always easy to match with the choices, but it often gets
    you into the right styles if you don't try to use the 'shaky' letter choices.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you think using a Tool takes the challenge out of the ID process, but I think
    our goal is to make the ID first. (Besides using this tool can be a challenge
    too.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    fair in war and love when it comes down to nailing an ID. We are dedicated to
    providing a positive identification as fast as possible, not to being gloryhounds
    or ego-strokers. Furthermore I use the same method when looking up stuff in Rookledge's.
