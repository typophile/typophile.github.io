<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>{Pardon Cross-Post} <br> <br>Recently I had the pleasure of perusing the first three <br>issues of TYPO magazine, a new Czech publication, <br>and I wanted to present a quick review of it. <br> <br><a href=http://www.magtypo.cz/ target=_blank>http://www.magtypo.cz/</a> <br> <br>Overall it looks like the polished work one would expect from <br>a sophisticated European source. It does feel a little thin in <br>terms of page count with respect to its other attributes which <br>are more generous (like spread size, production quality, etc), <br>but the information is concentrated, without however feeling <br>crowded. And this thin-ness leaves tantalizing room for easily <br>scaling up the content. My only typographic complaint is that <br>the English text seems too recessed: both smaller and grayer, <br>somewhat hard to read. <br> <br>On the other hand, it's great to have the text in both Czech <br>and English because the content of TYPO is certainly relevant <br>to much more than just Czech designers: many of the articles <br>are some of the best treatments of the given topic I've seen, <br>like the series on bitmap fonts in issue #3. Frankly, if you have <br>no interest in Eastern European type whatsoever even the <br>modest subscription price (6 Euro per issue) wouldn't actually <br>be worth it - but there's so much to learn form that part of the <br>world, it would be a shame to have such an isolationist stance. <br>The few articles not provided with English translations tend to <br>be technical discussions (like Mac OSX font managers) which <br>are easy to find in English elsewhere anyway. <br> <br>Besides the bitmap fonts articles the two others that stood <br>out for me were an interesting -and in fact unorthodox- bit <br>of coverage about newspaper fonts (in issue #1), and a very <br>insightful article about the development of the Prague graphic <br>identity (in #2). In this article were presented viewpoints <br>and analysis from all the possible angles, making for a very <br>objective treatment, totally unlike the insincere whitewash <br>we've become used to suffering in the large design magazines. <br> <br>TYPO also features some timely "news" items (like the Frothy <br>debacle, and that bancomicsans.com campaign), and last <br>but not least, it features Frantisek Storm... if you thought <br>his fonts were colorful, you should get a whif of his writing: <br>"Unlike the strictly rational Didot or elegant Bodoni, Walbaum <br> does not, at first sight, have features that would give the <br> fonts a brief adjective. However, it is definitely an outstanding <br> achievement, without any shadow of Walbaum's candymaking. <br>The expression is robust, as if seasoned with cow manure some- <br>where near Weimar, where Walbaum's type foundry was situated <br>in the years 1803-1839." <br> <br>So, as Filip Blazek (the magazine's editor) would say: Czech it out! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

Unfortunately, I think that makes sense.
A subscription is highly worth it.

<div class=commentbody>Jesse, 'TYPO' primarily IS a printed magazine, in Czech and English, and <em>( was )</em> additionally available as PDF version, later on. To quote the 'About' page on www.magtypo.cz: '<em>..It contains 32-44 full color pages printed on high quality coated paper..</em>'
Soo, The price you mention would / should be the one of a subscription to the printed mag + the shipping to your desired country. :)

<div class=commentbody>aight i figured that was for shipping and handeling but i never saw a price for pdfs so i was confused. So its $84 for 24 issues. Seems pricy but i guess it isn't that much per issue and shipping isn't cheap. Does anyone subscribe?
How does it compare to Baseline Magazine?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Actually it would be 6 issues / a year, according to the site as well. <em>( As its published bimonthly / every two months. I think the problem really is the 'International' shipping, as the mag itself would only be $ 30 USD. )</em>

<div class=commentbody>In fact TYPO is currently the only type magazine on the planet. Baseline (to which I subscribed for many years, paying a small fortune in the process, but actually recuperating it all thanks to an eBay sale of my back issues) has very little type design coverage these days, and it tends to be too arty. TYPO is a great mix of technique and art. There's also Eye (which I class above Baseline) but again its type design coverage is sparse compared to TYPO.
