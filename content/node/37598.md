    that sets it aside from other humanist sans serifs, like Frutiger for example.\r\nI
    hope that's not too harsh. :)"

  body: I'm afraid I have to echo Quincunx's comments. What's your goal with this
    design?

  body: Well done. I would agree that it could use some uniqueness, but the letters
    look very well drawn, and the weight range is impressive. I'm not a type designer,
    but I think if you can infuse this with a bit more individuality, you'll have
    a very nice workhorse typeface. I would keep working on this. I would use it.

  body: "I like it too. It looks clean and fresh and somehow reminds me of Stone Sans
    in the e and the a, and even slightly of Futura in the bolder weights. Are you
    going to make an italic? Perhaps that could add some unique character?\r\n\r\n"
