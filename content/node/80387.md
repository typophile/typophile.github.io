  body: Looks like it's a condensed Didot of some kind (hence the "t" shape). A decent
    approximation would be something like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typofonderie/ambroise-std-firmin/|Ambroise
    Firmin]], though it has a slight dip in the T shape which is easy enough to change
    if you're doing a logo.

  body: "Hey thanks! That's pretty good. The only difference beside the \"t\" it's
    probably the serifs that are more rounded here as opposed as the Didot or Ambroise
    that are flat, but I think it might work. If I can't find the exact font here
    I think I'll definitely get the Ambroise which is a nice font to have anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
