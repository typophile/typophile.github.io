body: We are a video production company that has been around for about 15 years, and
  want to update our logo. Here are variations of what we have come up with so far.
  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

  body: It's hard to evaluate a logo without knowing more about the company, and the
    image the company wants to project. What are you trying to communicate through
    your logo?

  body: I know flying monkeys aren't exactly neat. But I find your composition is
    a bit to bussy, messy, chaos.

  body: You've got a huge empty space between the words and an image that can't quite
    be positioned inside it. I would close it up to a normal word space and perch
    the monkey on top of the M.

  body: I love Jeremy Dean's Crackhouse but it was very hot in the mid 1990s. All
    products sold in those those years were extreme. In order to convey to the buyer
    that their products were sufficiently extreme, distressed fonts were used. Years
    later, Crackhouse use went down because new products were not even close to being
    as extreme as their mid 1990s equivalent. Teenagers now consume nachos which fail
    to set their hair on end or even produce a mild grimace. Even today's most extreme
    curly fries would induce a coma in yesteryear's teens.

  body: is there a way you could design the logo to represent a monkey head and then
    add wings to its side?

  body: The graphic looks a bit Wizard of Oz to me, which I think is a dated concept
    and probably won't resonate with todays younger market. Why not change the graphic
    to something like the top of a monkeys head (from the nose up) and have him wearing
    some old style pilots glasses. The other alternative is make you graphic smaller
    and rely on the wording to be evocative. I would definitely loose the camera,
    it looks a bit amateurish.

  body: "my first post here...\r\n\r\nmy first thoughts are the monkey is squatting
    (albeit with wings)\r\n\r\nand that the typography was too (and not for effect)
    broken...\r\n\r\njust before i started typing - the concept that popped into my
    head would have explored the shape of the old fashioned movie camera and a monkey's
    face drawn along the lines of the paul frank logo \r\n\r\nwww.seeklogo.com/images/P/Paul_Frank-logo-1921ECAC73-seeklogo.com.gif"
