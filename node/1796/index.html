		<div class="commentbody">Good suggestion. Eagle would probably be a good choice for this industry. <BR> <BR>During my initial consultation with the client, we determined that the most important elements to the customer relationship are trust and reliability. Recognizing the need for boldness &#40;&#34;aggressive and macho&#34;&#41; within industry applications and considering the look of reliability, I created the bold DETEX type. Also recognizing that most pest control is sold door-to-door during the day, I knew that the logo needed to be soft enough for a predominantly female market, hense, the soft &#34;E&#39;s&#34; and the gray &#40;vs. Unocal blue&#41; and orange &#40;vs. the industry standard red&#41; combination. I felt that this would help create warmth, rather than aggressive heat, and contribute to the trust factor. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m thinking that the space between the name and title on the bizcard needs to be decreased</div>

I think the look should be more aggressive that way? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think you should consider the female market as a market that want a softer look... that&#39;s just constructed ideas. The female market are not that easy. I think you could go more &#34;macho&#34;. <BR> <BR>The businesscards; are you showing the front and back of them in your preview, or is it just the front?

		<div class="commentbody">i think it&#39;s great!  much nicer than other pest control identities.  i see tons of bad blue-collar business logos.  good job.  <BR> <BR>two things though:  maybe try making the two E&#39;s a little wider.  they seem not as wide as the D for example.  it makes the word DETEX look a little weaker, when it should be stronger. <BR> <BR>also, the TM annoys me a little in its current location.  i suggest moving it somewhere that isn&#39;t so noticeable.  it sticks out because it&#39;s creating a tension with the corner and making you notice it.  maybe move it down next to the L.  i dont know.  good job though.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gray and Orange are a good combination, although a bit overused -- your designers delight looks better than the reflex blue look, which of course is bolder but simply doesn&#39;t work as nice and will of course need a third colour in printing for the text, which shouldn&#39;t be blue.  <BR> <BR>I absolutely do not like the way E and T as well E and X are done in one shape, almost as ligatured. It looks too clever for its own good...  I think a cleaner and simpler approach would be nicer and would probably have more longevity.  <BR> <BR>The business card is just great, the although I&#39;m sure the before bug shouldn&#39;t be just a fly &#40;no one calls pest control for that&#41; and the after bug should maybe just be more of a kind of red smear :-&#41;. Of course though, the shape of the card and the fly are a perfect fit and maybe a cockroach on your bizcard isn&#39;t the best idea... :-D. Maybe the DETEX could be a bit smaller and the typeface for the name and tel# and so on isn&#39;t my cuppa, for that kinda business and that logo a sans serif would be a better fit.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

Not sure how timeless it will be &#40;if that is an issue&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I like your t-shirt/hat mock-up. Perhaps just make those the corporate colors and let them use blue vs. grey depending on situation.&#39; <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t usually consider flies a pest. A bit annoying, but usually a sign that the mulch needs taking out rather than a need for an exterminator. As for insects-that-fit-on-a-bcard, I&#39;d say the ant is a good idea. Or a termite. <BR> <BR>The TM looks much better outside the orange field. <BR> <BR>The logo-esque &#39;e&#39; in PEST bothers me. Not sure why, but I read it as P EST.

		<div class="commentbody">I hate to do this to you, but I&#39;m siding with the client too in terms of color. Grey is a hard sell to a client, IMHO, so you may want to save your energies for a different battle ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>The card is nice. Two nitpicks: <BR> - no URL. I can&#39;t trust a company without a web site. ;o&#41; <BR> - dots in the phone number. Me no like. Seems &#39;trendy in art school but not really pratical in the real world&#39; IMHO.  <BR> <BR>I like that ant. A lot! But I&#39;m thinking the back of the card is too much/too obvious. I&#39;d suggest just having the ant as-is on the front and not try to push the whole before/after concept. If you do keep the ant on the back, I think it needs to somehow look &#39;more dead&#39;. Not sure how to go about that, though. Maybe a chalk outline? Headstone? Dunno...just thinking outloud... <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott, <BR> <BR>I like the design. However, I would like to see a darker blue that doesn&#39;t have as much brightness. Because the orange is bright, I think a duller blue would make the orange and blue work better together. Your &#34;e&#39;s&#34; feel like they have too much curve. I also don&#39;t like the middle bars being different lengths than the outer bars.  <BR> <BR>The &#34;E&#34; connecting only at the bottom of the &#34;X&#34; seems odd because the top has the same relationship as the bottom, and they don&#39;t connect. &#40;I hope that made sense&#41; I don&#39;t see anything wrong with just joining the e and the t. Joining the &#34;e&#34; and &#34;x&#34; seems forced. <BR> <BR>I think pest control could be a sans serif different than the title. I just used univers- I am sure you could find a better one. The orange arrow feels better with the same space between it and the &#34;x&#34; as the thickness of the font. I Hope this helps. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19345.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>-Tom</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Scott. <BR> <BR>Not bad so far. <BR> <BR>Nice card shape - corresponding with the logo. <BR> <BR>But: the before/after thing &#40;as is&#41; does not at all work for me. Nobody can tell &#40;without inspecting the card with a magnifier&#41; which ant &#40;or fly&#41; is alive and which is killed. People might think: &#34;Before: grey fly, after: white fly - cool, that&#39;s what I always wanted to spend my money for&#34;. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>And do away with that &#34;see other side for &#39;before&#39;&#34; instruction. That sounds sort of silly. ,-&#41; <BR> <BR>Maybe the happy vermin/poisoned vermin idea would work if somehow differently done. But, actually, I&#39;m not sure whether such a &#40;tendentially nasty&#41; illustration should be on a card. Maybe it should. I&#39;m a bit undecided here. ,-&#41; <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t make the job title lowercase only. I see no reason to do this. <BR> <BR>I guess I don&#39;t prefer the grey over the customer&#39;s blue. <BR>The grey might seem to be a bit more sophisticated, but IMO the dark blue suits the business well. <BR>Hrant&#39;s right: three colors in the logo are too much. <BR>Tom&#39;s colors are very strong. I think I like them. <BR> <BR>regards <BR>jpg</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I tend to like the client&#39;s rather gentler blue. <BR> <BR>The thing that bothers me about the EX-ligature is the angle that the upper arm of the X is cut at - if it ended vertically rather than horizontally, I think it might flow better.  &#40;Unfortunately this unbalances the top of the glyph and makes the orange arrow look forced&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll second the curled-up legs for the dead insect; the splat effect could be in poor taste. <BR> <BR>The complaint regarding the shape of the logo Es: what if only the bottom arm had a corner with the stem?

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all for the incredible critique. Unfortunately, I have become somewhat overloaded with work and will not have time to address each of your helpful comments, but let me assure you that I have used all of your postings to get this design to where it is now. <BR> <BR>Due to a client response lull, I had some time away from this project. I hope that I remembered everything that I intended to do. Take a look and let me know if I&#39;m still missing some things. I tried to apply a lot of changes to this revision this afternoon and I fear I may have even missed some of the positive adjustments I made on previous versions. <BR> <BR>The colors are confirmed and due to budget constraints, I need to keep the cards down to 2/1. Because of this we now have a dark blue ant. I think it is small enough that it will still work. On the reverse side, I went with the ant on its back with its let up in the air. The tag line, &#34;after DETEX&#34;, probably needs to be present for people who haven&#39;t followed this thread to get it. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for all your help. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19798.jpg" alt="Detex Identity"></div>

I wouldn&#39;t worry about that other detex logo, sometimes certain letters just come together in certain ways. <BR> <BR>My only note is that I am not so sure on the type on the back of the card. HAving pest controller off to the right isn&#39;t sitting that well with me. Perhaps there needs to be a little more of a margin between the text on the left and the text on the right.

As a child it was fun to spot them in the sea of otherwise boring 70s-mobiles &#40;ah, suburban sprawl&#41;. <BR>I looked them up and they&#39;re still around &#40;maybe you&#39;ve heard of them -- people here in the Northeast haven&#39;t&#41;.

An example of rare humor in the pest control industry. <BR> <BR>Their &#34;mouse&#34; logo became so familiar to people in that area that the company started doing ads with a sign-off of the mouse ears, whiskers and tail without the words Truly Nolen... sort of like what Target does now. <BR> <BR>Good luck with your project. <BR> <BR>Troy <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20213.jpg" alt="image 1"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20214.jpg" alt="image 2"></div>
