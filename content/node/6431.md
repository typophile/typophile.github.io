    <BR>Nice! Maybe the Futura Italic is not the right choice... The lettering is
    slanted enought maybe Regular futura?

  body: Yes, you should definetly use an upright typeface instead of the slanted.
    My concern is also that the &#34;fotografia profissional&#34; is too small compared
    to the name, the text will not be legible in small sizes.
