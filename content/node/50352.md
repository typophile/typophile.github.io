body: "Although I do not consider myself an artist, I have the artistic reflex deeply
  engrained in the fibres of my being. Whenever I see an opportunity I am known to
  do <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12347\">crazy stuff</a> for the good cause.\r\n\r\nFirst
  the bad news -- there\u2019s something wrong with <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=309\">FontPool</a>.
  A leak at the bottom of the stairs caused the pool to drain, leaving only a shallow
  body of water at the bottom. We don't know if and when it can be repaired.\r\n\r\nThen,
  I received a request from Lisa, Lynn & Laurence, three students of the second year
  Graphic Design at <a href=\"http://www.kask.be/index.php?/grafische_vormgeving\">KASK</a>,
  the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Gent (where I graduated myself). They had an assignment
  for the first semester: to design and produce a 40 page magazine for which they
  also had to provide the content. Which is why they asked if they could interview
  me. After they had conducted the interview yesterday, they asked if they could take
  a couple of pictures to illustrate it. While looking around to find a setting a
  bit more interesting than the obvious dude-sitting-at-a-table, the almost empty
  pool caught my eye...\r\n\r\nSee the pictures <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/fontshop/sets/72157607885176245/detail/\">here</a>.
