  body: "''Times, Bodoni and Univers are still in use.''\r\n\r\nand they always will
    be, but i prefer Arnhem, activ grotesk and scotch modern (all pretty recent designs)...
    i agree that a lot of crap is also being made, but for every 1000 crap type designers
    you have a Bruno Maag, Fred Smeijers, Nick Shinn, H&FJ ... plus the stuff being
    designed by the MA classes in Uni of Reading and KABK are all top quality and
    usually very interesting faces tht id be more than happy to use... as with everything
    in life quality will be what counts."

  body: "<em>Do you think today's new typefaces will still be in use fifty years from
    now?</em>\r\n\r\nOf the types I published 10 or 15 years ago, some have proved
    to be more durable than others.\r\nBeaufort, Handsome, Bodoni Egyptian for instance;
    Morphica and Artefact, not so much.\r\nAt the time of design, it's impossible
    to know which is the mayfly, which the quahog.\r\nBut I do believe that one or
    two may still be in use 50 years from now.\r\n\r\nCertainly, it helps to update
    formats: I've gone from PostScript Type 1 (\"legacy\") to OpenType and now web
    fonts.\r\nNonetheless, as long as the legacy formats continue to be supported
    by layout applications, all manner of typefaces will survive.\r\nIt helps that
    in the digiverse there is scant difference between warehouse and museum\u2014which
    retailers delete poorly selling stock?\r\nThe tale is long."

    a medium that allowed people to interpret his music forever. We get totally fresh
    readings from someone like Glen Gould hundreds of years later. If you interpret
    the others you are in a \"cover\" band.\r\n\r\npbc"

    music, is a great way to help answer this question. \r\nI have come to a personal
    conclusion that every typeface is usable. If you believe a typeface is bad, then
    you have simply not yet found a use for it."

  body: I like the music analogy, we know what we like, there are stars and classics
    songs, the rest is generally just background noise, with the occasional new stars
    and new classics appearing. Well continue to play our favourites and get knew
    ones, some won't stand the test of time, that is the way of the world. I guess
    the difference is these days is that the variety of fonts and their accessibility
    is incredible, the hard part for the new designer is knowing what makes a font
    great. I don't believe all fonts are useable, except maybe to the person who designed
    it, readability is a great reality check, particularly when letters are strung
    together to form that singular graphic unit called a word.
