body: I'm in the process of building a case feature into my typeface, and I know that
  feature usually includes punctuation, brackets, @ sign etc. but what about normal
  letters? For example, most fonts I've looked at don't include sub [a b c] by [A
  B C] but when selecting all caps in a layout program, these changes are still made.
  However, some letters, such as eth and eszett (and very bizarrely, ydieresis, which
  leads me to believe it might be a bug in the layout program - in this case, illustrator
  CS5), are not changed to their upper case counterparts (eszett is not even changed
  to SS, as one might expect). So my question is, should these glyphs be put in the
  case feature (sub germandbls by uni1E9E; sub eth by Eth; etc.) and if these glyphs
  are included in the feature, shouldn't a, b, c etc. also be included to make it
  cleaner?

  body: So I should basically leave letters out of the case feature and assume that
    the problems with illustrator don't affect indesign or quark etc. Do you put the
    capital sharp s in any feature then, or just leave it up to the user to find?
