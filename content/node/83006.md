  Systems last year but only got round to putting it online recently. It had some
  positive buzz on Tumblr so I thought I'd run it by the professionals and see what
  they thought ;)\r\n\r\nBear in mind, it's based on a simplified system and just
  3 months of being taught the fundamentals of Typography in my second language.\r\n\r\nI've
  put it up for sale on Mysoti but I'm thinking I might fork out for a run of decent
  A2 digital prints myself and put them up for sale if people are interested.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n(High

    with London\u2019s tube railway network? You could display nearly anything in
    that manner and it would not make much sense either. \r\nFWIW, I think you were
    just tempted to pinch the famous Underground map design \u2026 which I understand.\r\n"

    and well executed exercise, not dissimilar to the periodic table of typefaces
    or other Underground map-inspired designs."

  body: "Good idea\u2014requiring you to consider the intersection of categories,
    and come to the conclusion that certain faces, eg Broadway, are representative
    of more than one.\r\n\r\nSure, it's a clich\xE9 to appropriate an infographic
    metaphorically\u2014and the correspondence between form and content will be forced
    and not entirely logical\u2014but that may lead to discoveries (see Broadway,
    above).\r\n\r\nAFAIK, although the Tube map has been repurposed before, nobody
    has yet swiped it for type classification, so there is some originality involved.
    At least it's not the periodic table.\r\n\r\nWhile I would have liked to have
    seen more \"St Pancras\" multi-intersections, and a Circle Line, I think you did
    a good job of making the design work both conceptually, and in the execution of
    the map.\r\n\r\nAs a product, I'm not sure it's particularly functional unless
    one knows what the faces look like. Isn't there some way to show the faces without
    disrupting the modernist minimalism too much?\r\n\r\nAnd I certainly won't be
    buying a print, although I might commission you to produce a Shinntype version
    :-)\r\n\r\nYes, that would be the 21st century meta-design trick\u2014create a
    program that spits out a map for whatever group of keyworded-by-category faces
    are entered. (The MyFonts tag cloud does that, although \"free\" isn't much of
    a phenotype.)\r\n\r\n"

    the same. They're not actually the same but based on the same thing. I'd connect
    it to DIN before Helvetica.\r\n\r\nHattenschweiler and Impact are very similar
    too.\r\n\r\nI feel like Grotesque, Akzidenz Grotesk, and Franklin Gothic should
    be on the same line.\r\n\r\nI think the legibility warnings are more about which
    fonts are out of fashion. Is Arial really less legible than OCR A? Is Comic Sans
    really less legible than Kaufmann?\r\n"
