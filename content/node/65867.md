  new issue of House Beautiful.  I keep getting close but I cannot seem to find it.  Any
  ideas on the foundry or name?  Thank you!

    older thread</a> (about Pistilli Roman):\r\n<cite>Phil Martin\u2019s Didoni is
    a close copy, but the digital version\u2019s hairlines are not nearly as thin.
    Phil\u2019s version was not a straight knock-off. He added a bunch of swash and
    alternate characters. Ironically, Phil\u2019s contributions are missing from the
    URW digitization, so what you get is essentially just a knock-off of Pistilli
    Roman.</cite>\r\n\r\nHence, this might be the 'original\u2019 swashy Didoni, or
    an unknown digitization of it. "
