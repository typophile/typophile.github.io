  the history and origins of the alphabet. I have seen a previous thread asking about
  the single and double storied a and g but didn't see an answer to the question of
  their origins. Does anyone know how double storied letters came to be, or can someone
  direct me to a resource where I might find the answer?\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nRobert"

    during a process taking the time of more than five Hundred centuries. Try to get
    hold of works and images of that period. It will shed some light on your issue."

    centuries or five long centuries of 112 years... typos and Freudian slips will
    happen if English is not your first language.
