body: "As seen [[http://typophile.com/node/89441|here]], I've been modifying the B
  from Erato Light in an attempt to recreate this exotic letterform. I would like
  now you to be constructively critic on it. I'll be grateful for any suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe
  word Bruna is just a dummy. I've experimented a different R too, as a way of balancing
  the extra weight of the new B. Does that even make any sense? Opinions on it will
  be welcome.\r\n\r\nBelow, Erato Light, the modified B and the modified B e R, respectively.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "It depends on the desired effect:\r\nIf you like/need the B to stand out
    and/or be used alone, you could even leave R unchanged (or modify it more subtly:
    the gap now is a bit too wide).\r\nIf you like/need that all letters appear to
    belong equally to the same font, I think you should modify R and probably A a
    bit more, adding serifs like the new ones in the new B."
