  body: It's much more efficient to use indents than line breaks between paragraphs.
    A line break suggests a break in the text and should be used more judiciously.
    Line breaks + indents = redundant (plus bad typography).

  body: "You don't <em>need</em> to have a line space and an indentation to separate,
    although you can if you prefer, but on the 1st paragraph of a section it is more
    usual to not indent.\r\nTim"

  body: "I have a tendancy to think in terms of working typography and not working,
    as opposed to good or bad typography. Most typographic concepts work well in context,
    and poorly outside of it.\r\nThis was set for a word count and rough to make sure
    that I have room, the indents are good enough to make it into the Elements of
    Typographic Style, so they are good enough for me. I will probably be outdenting
    the dates of the diary entries, thus the indented first paragraph, but I need
    TYPE suggestions, not crit on what little I have done so far. The preview was
    to aquiant you with the format and the variables as far as relative column widths
    and rough style. "
