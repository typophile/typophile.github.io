  body: There is a somewhat similar round corners FL plugin by BetaType posted somewhere
    in this forum, but you have to apply it glyphs by glyphs, as opposed to an entire
    font.

  body: IIRC Rounding UFO was developed to create the Unit Rounded family by creating
    two masters with different rounding values for each font and then interpolating
    a series with Superpolator to get the best results. And Linotype seems to have
    used it to hack out a crapload of rounded versions of classic fonts, although
    the successfulness of those designs is debatable.
