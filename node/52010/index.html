  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Oh hai! For my last semester getting my BFA in Graphic Design, I am signing up for an independent study to design a series of four display faces and one text face based on the four quadrants of Knoxville, TN (I&rsquo;m not going to get into the particulars of the project anymore on here&hellip; it&rsquo;s not really relevant to my question, I suppose) and I have to write a proposal/time-line/statement type document outlining the project, goals, research etc&hellip; I was wondering if anyone out here would know of any other well done projects (not that I want to steal anyone&rsquo;s ideas about the DESIGN, more or less I am just looking for good organization, tone of voice with copy, reasonable time frames, etc&hellip;), books, articles, websites, ANYTHING really as sort of a jumping off point for me to scan through whilst writing my own&hellip; Comments/opinions/questions, etc&hellip; would totally be appreciated as well.</p>
<p>I suppose the things that I am thinking about are ::</p>
<ul>
<li>Should the proposal be a thesis where I am PROVING something in my design efforts (that the travel of monied areas in Knoxville throughout the last century–from east to north, from north to west, etc&hellip; can be traced by the different visual aspects of the signage in said areas)?</li>
<li>With these typefaces I hope to create a system wherein the text face complements all four of the display faces, but in talking about my proposal, should I emphasize more the historical significance and research or should I put the emphasis on the usability and legibility of the typefaces themselves? I really don&rsquo;t want to make a Sufjan Stevens &ldquo;this is a project about a particular place&rdquo; typeface–I really want these to ultimately be very usable fonts that are important outside of the context of Knoxville.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that I will have about a million more questions, but the coffee has set in and I have to get back to work. If anyone has anything to add, just want to say thank you so much in advance.
s.e.</p>
