body: "Hi Folks, I have been working on a listing of fonts used in newspapers and
  magazines (a new project in its early stages). The main interest is in the text,
  titles and caption types inside the publications, but in this case I was curious
  what the Sierra Club was using for their magazine's title (SIERRA). You can see
  it on this page from their site (http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/). Anyone recognize
  it?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n- Mike "

    find me a mimic when I launch my site. Perhaps we can join forces.\r\n\r\nDon't
    recognize the Sierra logo. It's likely custom as many magazine titles can be."

    part my research for a recent redesign I compiled a list of those same characteristics
    for a bunch of magazines in the Northeast U.S. Happy to share it with either/both
    of you."

  body: "Well, whaddaya know, great minds DO think alike, heh, heh!\r\n\r\nFor the
    SIERRA logo, I thought Parkinson Condensed was the most like it, so that sure
    fits -- thanks Marc. The custom logos are the reason that I didn't have Title
    in my database, but I thought Sierra's type looked familiar, and it was nagging
    me.\r\n\r\nMarc, is your information in a spreadsheet (Excel)? I'd like to get
    a copy of whatever you collected. Thanks for the offer.\r\n\r\nI would be happy
    to collaborate with you Stephen. Is your project for Typographi.ca or FontShop?
    I expect you have more compiled than I do at this point, so I'd be fine with helping
    you on yours if I can link to it from my site. If you want to assign me some magazines
    or newspapers to review, I would do that.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Would love to have you on the team, Mike and Marc. I'll contact you soon.
