  body: 'I&#39;d say it&#39;s a customized version of Radiant, available from any
    number of vendors. The f and s have been tweaked, and not very well, I think.

  body: Jay, keep in mind that mast heads of magazines and  <BR>newspapers are more
    often than not custom designed. <BR>Radiant is the best way to go in approximating
    this.

    target=_top>Radiant Extra Condensed</a> is the closer I know, but take also a
    look at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/cameo-rr/heavyline/testdrive.html?s=House%2BBeautiful&amp;p=72"

  body: I&#39;d have guessed it was a custom logo &#40;or a font from the pre-digital
    era, that mag&#39;s been around forever&#41; but they use it elsewhere on their
    web site so it might exist digitally. You could try calling them to find out.
    Or use Radiant.
