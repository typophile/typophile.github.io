  me - how should a copyright line really be written, are there any rules?\r\n\r\nI
  opened five books from respectable publishers (mainly US/UK) and found five alternatives
  (not to give undue credit/critique to anyone I've replaced the copyright holder
  with a random name):\r\n\r\nCopyright \xA9 2009 colaboy\r\ncopyright \xA9 colaboy,
  2009\r\nCopyright \xA9 2009 by colaboy\r\nCopyright \xA9 colaboy 2009\r\n\xA9 colaboy
  2009\r\n\r\nI've also come across:\r\n\r\n\xA92009 colaboy\r\n\xA9colaboy, 2009\r\netc\r\n\r\nWhat
  usage do you makers/users of the symbol suggest? \r\n\r\nDaniel"

    theory, if you have the symbol, you don't need the word copyright. I suspect people
    started using both in the days of 8-bit character sets, when one couldn't be sure
    that the symbol would be correctly displayed if the document were opened on another
    platform; now it seems to have become conventional."

    of the U.S. Copyright Code:\r\n\r\n(b) Form of Notice.\u2014If a notice appears
    on the copies, it shall consist of the following three elements:\r\n&nbsp;  (1)
    the symbol \xA9 (the letter C in a circle), or the word \u201CCopyright\u201D,
    or the abbreviation \u201CCopr.\u201D; and\r\n&nbsp;  (2) the year of first publication
    of the work; in the case of compilations or derivative works incorporating previously
    published material, the year date of first publication of the compilation or derivative
    work is sufficient. The year date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or
    sculptural work, with accompanying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on
    greeting cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles;
    and \r\n&nbsp;  (3) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation
    by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation
    of the owner.\r\n\r\nYou can find this information in Chapter 4 of Title 17:\r\nhttp://www.copyright.gov/title17/\r\n\r\nThis
    doesn't necessarily prescribe the order \"Copyright, date, author\", but that's
    how I usually see it and do it myself. Redundancy of word and symbol is optional.\r\n\r\n--
