  square. Are there any <em>display font</em> situations where a tilde would need
  to be differentiated from a macron?'

    it's probably not going to come up.  A straight line is fine in Spanish but other
    languages that distinguish tilde vs acute might.  In this font, how are you doing
    your macron vs your acute?\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que

  body: "Sorry about that. I completely botched the answer. Yes, my acute and grave
    look like a proper acute and grave. Only the macron and tilde are identical.\r\n\r\nAs
    for other languages, so far, I haven't come across one that includes both tildes
    and macrons. The exception being descriptions of long vowels, dictionaries etc.
    Nothing where you'd likely a display font.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You could probably still disambiguate the tilde from the macron by attaching
    small rungs of sorts on the edge of the macron design.  Just putting a bottom
    rung on the left side, and a top one on the right.  You won't have to curve it,
    and will be using a more traditional style to boot.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es
