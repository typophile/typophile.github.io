  body: I don't think you need to put the title 'contact information', it should be
    obvious without it.  Maybe there could be more leading on the contact info?

  body: "I liked the thin font for the main title in the first version a lot. Is that
    St Marie? The script font in your latest version is extremely generic, and the
    mustard color is a step backwards to, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAlso, are you sure
    the girl's name is Shirlery, rather than Shirley?"

  body: 'The feather hair extension business card looks wonderful and attracts easily
    someone''s attention. Any respectable business should create an unique business
    card and a logo. The cosmetology school from <a href="http://tristatecosmetology.com/schedules/">http://tristatecosmetology.com/schedules/</a>
    teaches anyone how to become a professional cosmetician and when one of these
    students will want to open a business in this field, he should resort to your
    services. '
