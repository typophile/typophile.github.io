    this is something similar but different.\r\n\r\nVerlag is quite close, but there
    are subtle differences, and the black weight isn't heavy enough."

  body: "Yeah, it looks like they changed the G, which was a sort of quirky letter
    that may have looked too much like a C in the original version, but I don't see
    it as an alternate in the font itself. Speaking of 'Original', that word on the
    package looks like our own Mark Simonson's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/coquette/|\"Coquette\"]].
