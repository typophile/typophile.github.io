  body: Only Mercator I know is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.100872.0.0">this
    design</a> by [[Arthur Baker]], and it's certainly no sans serif.

  body: Mercator is very Ludovico degli Arrighi-ish (to my eye), broadpen script with
    swashes, very calligraphic. Perhaps you're thinking of Mentor or Mercury?

  body: Mercator was a type designed by Dick Dooijes for Amsterdam (1957-61). It has
    a nice Q. Dont know about a digital one. And yes, it was sans serif :)

    in my own collection - I have a Mercator from 1994 - put out by Brenel Informatik

    Eden...\r\n\r\nA sample of which Mercator \"Sans\" would be most helpful."
