body: "Following the recent discovery that the Gurmukhi writing system is supported
  in InDesign CS6 using only the legacy 'guru' script tag instead of the preferred
  'gur2' tag, I set out today to determine  which script tags are used for each of
  the Indic scripts supported in InDesign CS6, and hence what will need to be implemented
  in fonts in order to get them to work in this environment. My method was first to
  test each script using a font that supports only the newer '---2' script tags (Nirmala
  UI) and if this failed to then test with a font that supports the legacy tags (mostly
  old MS fonts). The PDF results of the tests are attached.\r\n\r\nSome background
  on the two sets of script tags:\r\nMicrosoft originally defined OTL script level
  tags for each of the Indic scripts in Unicode, and then proceeded to implement shaping
  engines for many (but not all) of these. Some time after Windows XP shipped with
  these shaping engines and corresponding fonts, Microsoft decided that certain bugs
  in the shaping engines would require fixes to those engines and corresponding changes
  to fonts, and that these changes would make the fonts non-backwards compatible with
  the Windows XP shaping engines. This was put forward for discussion on the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otlist.htm\">OT
  developer mailing list</a>, and I suggested that it would be possible to make fonts
  that worked with both shaping engine behaviours if Microsoft, instead of changing
  the behaviour associated with the existing script tags, registered a new set of
  script tags for each script. This is what they did, and as a result it is possible
  to create e.g. a Devanagari font that is backwards compatible with the 'deva' tag
  shaping in WinXP and with the 'dev2' shaping in Windows Vista and later. [I won't
  go into details here of the problems with the old shaping that prompted this change,
  or what needs to be done differently for each script tag in fonts.]\r\n\r\nWhen
  Adobe announced that InDesign CS6 would officially support a significant number
  of Indian writing systems (some unofficial support was provided in CS5 and 5.5 if
  one activated the World Ready Composer), I was thrilled. I also presumed that this
  support would utilise the newer '---2' script tags, since these have been around
  for almost a decade now, and I don't think I'm alone in considering the older tags
  'legacy' software, i.e. not something for which I expected anyone to be rolling
  out new support in 2012! Indeed, Microsoft list the old Indic font specs on their
  website as '<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/SpecificationsOverview.mspx\">deprecated</a>'.
  I was also encouraged in this expectation by initial testing of Hindi fonts that
  revealed solid IS CS6 support for the 'dev2' script tag.\r\n\r\nSo I was somewhat
  perplexed this past week, trying to figure out why my Gurmukhi 'gur2' font wasn't
  working in ID CS6, to discover that Gurmukhi support in the app seems to be via
  the old 'guru' script tag only. It was relatively easy to build a font supporting
  both script tags, and to confirm that this then worked in ID CS6, but I was left
  wondering which of the other supported scripts used which tags. Hence today's testing.\r\n\r\nThis
  is the summary of my findings: three of the scripts use the newer '---2' tags, but
  the six others use the old, legacy, deprecated tags and corresponding shaping behaviour.
  One of the scripts, Malayalam, seems to use the newer tag, but has a bug affecting
  correct shaping of <em>chillu</em> forms.\r\n\r\n'dev2' Devanagari\r\n'mlm2' Malayalam
  *buggy*\r\n'ory2' Odia (Oriya)\r\n\r\n'beng' Bengali\r\n'gujr' Gujurati\r\n'guru'
  Gurmukhi\r\n'knda' Kannada\r\n'taml' Tamil\r\n'telu' Telugu\r\n\r\nI find this use
  of the old tags very disappointing. In recent years I have made a number of Indic
  fonts, and in no cases was the client concerned about backwards compatibility with
  Windows XP shaping. The only fonts in which I was requested to include support for
  both script tags for a script are the Adobe Devanagari fonts; ironically, Devanagari
  is one of the scripts for which Adobe use the newer tag in ID Cs6. I doubt if I
  am alone in presuming that the legacy tags would only be used for legacy purposes,
  and could be omitted from newer fonts targeting post-Vista environments. Now it
  looks like my clients and other users who have been waiting eagerly for many years
  for Adobe to officially support Indian writing systems will need to 'downdate' fonts
  in order to enjoy that support."

  body: John, thanks for this. I found it about Gujarati some weeks ago (in CS 5).
    And you are certainly not alone who is sad about this. From our testing using
    IndicPlus plug-in (on CS3) for Devanagari it also relies on the older layout (deva).
    I am not sure about the version of the plug-ins, maybe there are some more recent
    which support dev2 (?). So I would say that Indic fonts need to be downdated if
    they are to be used in DTP.

    it too uses the old script tag shaping.

  body: "David, \r\n\r\nMetaDesign Solutions who developed Indic Plus say that from
    version CS4 onwards, that plugin exposes InDesign's built-in World-Ready composer
    rather than relying on MetaDesign's own composer. MetaDesign's own composer which
    was used in CS2 and CS3 was built upon ICU Layout, so it only used the old script
    tags. The World-Ready composer seems to do the same. \r\n\r\nOther solutions such
    as InTools' World Tools Pro or Winsoft's ScribeDoor also \"only\" expose the World-Ready
    composer (World Tools Pro in addition exposes the Japanese composer). To my knowledge,
    no custom composer exists for the most recent versions of InDesign. \r\n\r\nHowever,
    given that MetaDesign Solutions had developed their own composer in the past,
    I think they'd be the right place to send your concerns. You might convince them
    that it'd make sense for them to continue developing their own composer. They
    might consider switching from ICU Layout to HarfBuzz, though. Then, they'd get
    the most current support. Alternatively, they might also consider developing a
    composer for InDesign for Windows only, which would use the system Uniscribe library.
    \r\n\r\nWhether such development could gather sufficient critical mass of potential
    customers so that it'd make business sense for somebody like MetaDesign Solutions
    to actually do it -- is another matter. \r\n\r\nPerhaps Tiro Typeworks should
    just comission MetaDesign Solutions to do one of the options above, and market
    the plugins as Tiro. You could get some custom features in, then. You might even
    get them to port the XeTeX \"MATH\" engine to an InDesign plugin, effectively
    enabling OpenType MATH support in InDesign. (Oh, you could also get them to support
    JSTF, and a few other things... :) ). \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    the new Indic tags. HarfBuzz does support them, and there is reportedly some effort
    under way to replace ICU Layout with HarfBuzz in XeTeX. As I''m told, ICU Layout
    is basically "dead", which HarfBuzz is very much alive, under dynamic development
    and is said to already be quite mature. '

  body: "No, I do not speak Telugu. I understand how the writing system works, and
    can tell from examining what happens as a result of particular layout engines
    and fonts what is being done technically, which was the point of this analysis.
    I didn't design either of the Telugu types shown, although I built the one that
    implements 'tel2' shaping that fails in CS6 (that font looks very much better
    in Win8, for which it was designed and in which the correct shaping is applied;
    it is a UI font, though, subject to a large number of technical restrictions that
    forced design compromises; a good text face would not be subject to the same constraints).\r\n\r\nThe
    '---2' are not the old ones; they're the new ones. I don't know why CS6 uses the
    old shaping tags for most scripts. I believe the new '---2' tags is used for Devanagari
    because Adobe had their own 'dev2' Devanagari font, developed several years ago,
    and the ---2' tags for Odia and Malayalam are presumably used because, to my knowledge,
    no one ever shipped a shaping engine that used the old tags for those scripts.
    In other words, the old Odia and Malayalam shaping was defined by Microsoft but
    superseded by the new shaping before it was implemented anywhere."

    I am able to confirm that this is true, so Malayalam support in ID CS6 seems to
    be complete with that caveat.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mlm2cs6_6112.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
    odd because chillu formation would seem to me to be a script shaping issue, not
    language-specific, and in any case the test font contains only 'dflt' language
    system tag. I don't understand why all aspects of Malayalam shaping other than
    chillus happen correctly without the language needing to be set.\r\n\r\nBut hoorary
