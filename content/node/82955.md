  alt=\"logo\" />\r\n\r\nI have to build a part of their website for a project.\r\n\r\nTo
  integrate the logo, I need to change its color but I don't know which font has been
  used.\r\n\r\nCan you find it?\r\n\r\nThank you."

    but something like [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/bell+gothic|Bell Gothic]] (or
    even more [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/letter+gothic/|Letter Gothic]]could
    do the trick at small size). [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/onuava/|Onuava]]
    is also close. Having a look to their \"similars\" at MyFonts could be helpful
    too: [[http://new.myfonts.com/morelike/40300/|here]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/morelike/40362/|here]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/morelike/29887/|here]]\r\n- Brest: first thought
    was \"freebie\" or at least, custom from an existing font \"not-so-well-designed\".
    Could be [[http://www.dafont.com/yorkville.font|Yorkville]]\r\n- \xE9cole d'ing\xE9nieurs:
    looks like Myriad but I'm probably wrong.\r\nThe other solution would be to switch
    to their actual corporate typeface, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/target/|T-26]],
    as it could be seen on [[http://www.isen.fr/|their main website]] and use Myriad
    as complementary."
