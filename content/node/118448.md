    body: "\xB6 <em>Iowan Old Style</em> is more Griffo than Jenson. It reminds me
      <em>Goudy Old Style</em> a bit. It's an early Garalde (Manuce type) and not
      an humanistic one in the tradition of Jenson's and the slanted cross stroke
      of the lowercase \"e\"."

  body: "Well, in the other thread, I've mentioned Cloister Oldstyle; Kennerley and
    Eusebius are favorites of mine as well. I also like that imitation of Golden,
    Jenson Oldstyle.\r\n\r\nLooking up Aurelia, while Hermann Zapf had said that he
    based it on Jenson, I'd be tempted to class it as an oldstyle typeface, but not
    a Venetian.\r\n\r\nBut that may not be reasonable. After all, Golden was a very
    exaggerated take on Jenson, while Eusebius was much more faithful. So Venetians
    don't have to look like Italia or Jenson Oldstyle. They can look like Centaur.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    for that matter, didn't Aldus Manutilus also print out of Venice, not just Nicolas
    Jenson? So is Bembo a Venetian? A page about the Yale typeface seems to think
    so."
