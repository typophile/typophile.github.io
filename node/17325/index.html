		<div class="commentbody"><p>The only book on your list that I have read is the original printing (1988-89) of <em>Typographie</em>. I also have another of Aicher&rsquo;s obscure books named <em>In Rotis</em>, which has nothing to do with the &ldquo;super type family&rdquo; Rotis, but about the mini-think-tank he ran near his residence in Rotis in the Allgäu region of Germany. (Both of his books were inscribed to me saying something like &ldquo;Norbert &ndash; for the time you spent here in Rotis&rdquo; or so he said. It probably said, &ldquo;Nobert &ndash; now go on and get out of here you little doofus!&rdquo; since I still can&rsquo;t read his writing.)</p>
<p>I spent a couple of years going back and forth from Massachusetts to Germany working with Otl Aicher during his development of Rotis type family.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of links that might lead to additional works by Aicher. He did teach in the states a while, but I don&rsquo;t have that info at hand at this moment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Someday I will endeavor to write about my experiences with Otl Aicher (which for me was wonderful) and about the development of the Rotis type family during transitioning from Aicher&rsquo;s studio (he had his own Ikarus system) to Agfa (we had to adapt the outlines to our database) which was NOT so wonderful.</p>
<p>Erik put it well:
<em>We have a word for that in German: Rotis is a “Kopfgeburt”, it is born from (by?) the head.</em></p>
<p>If anything, Aicher was a formalist in turmoil. A philosopher in spirit who was shackled by his &ldquo;sense&rdquo; of order. He called for revolution in design and typography, but adhered to the grid (anti-nature) in distrust of chaos.</p>
<p>He admired Adrian Frutiger immensely and one can undoubtably see how Univers influenced the Rotis matrix.</p>
<p>If one reads deeper into Aicher&rsquo;s <em>Typographie</em>, one will see Aicher&rsquo;s concepts as being less typographic (relating to type design and type layout) and more involved with humans within a rapidly changing environment in need of new symbology and notation systems.</p>
<p>There are some aspects to the Rotis forms that I find interesting, but most of the weights leave me cold&hellip; from the first time I saw initial test through the release and promotional material.</p>
<p>By the time the entire Rotis family was available for sale, my job had less to do with type promotion, so I never really spent much time setting the faces and learning what unique and usable aspects could be exploited.</p>
<p>I am far more an admirer of Herr Aicher than Rotis the type family (Rotis the village was idyllic) and will eventually share more of my experiences and learning from Otl Aicher.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There is also very nicely designed issue of Form+Zweck 
about Hochschule fuer Gestaltung Ulm available:
<a href="http://www.formundzweck.com/titel.php?20">http://www.formundzweck.com/titel.php?20</a></p>
<p>(Form+Zweck is always beautifully designed, even if it tends to be 
&lsquo;over-designed&rsquo; sometimes.) 
It is in German, but the magazine goes with a CD 
on which you can find an English version as a PDF.
This issue covers different aspects of the Hochschule fuer Gestaltung Ulm
rather than only Otl Aicher.
However, there&rsquo;s also an article in it about Aicher&rsquo;s illustrations for a book 
about William of Ockham.</p>
<p>The best introduction to Aicher&rsquo;s design philosophy is in my opinion 
his essay &lsquo;Die dritte Moderne&rsquo; (&lsquo;Third modernism&rsquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>or something similar: I only know the German edition)
in &lsquo;Die Welt als Entwurf&rsquo; (&lsquo;World as design&rsquo;).</li>
</ul>
<p>Aicher&rsquo;s book &lsquo;Typographie&rsquo; is also quite interesting. 
His considerations about center axis versus left-ranged title pages and 
about the importance of the lower case are worth to be read, to whatever 
own conclusion the reader might come.</p>
<p>BTW, Jost Hochuli was quite critical about this book 
(especially about the design of this book), as one can read 
in Hochuli &lsquo;Designing books&rsquo; where Hochuli wrote (without mentioning 
Aicher or the title of the book &lsquo;Typographie&rsquo;) that functionalism is in danger 
of becoming a superficial pose if text is printed on ultra-white paper
(which creates a too strong contrast and is therefore hard to read) 
in a book which is almost 2 kilogram heavy. Even if Hochuli did not mention
Aicher, at the time this text was published first, everybody knew to which book 
Hochuli was referring to. (I do not have &lsquo;Designing books&rsquo; here with me, 
I am quoting out of my memory. The exact words of this critical comment 
should be in &lsquo;Designing books&rsquo; somewhere between page 12 and 14.)</p>
<p>Aicher&rsquo;s writing is very critical about any style or superficial aesthetics in design 
and never lacks a certain polemic note.</p>
<p>The questions Aicher raises are sometimes more interesting than his answers 
to these questions.</p>
<p>It would be a little bit unfair to judge Aicher only by looking at Rotis,
and by doing so one would cut oneself off from the opportunity 
of coming to know his design philosophy which always revolves round 
the question of the designer&rsquo;s responsibility. His strong moral point of view 
also traces back from his experiences in Nazi-Germany where he was in contact 
with the resistance group Weisse Rosearound Sophie Scholl.</p>
<p>Aichers design for the Olympic games 1972 (and his pictograms) 
brought him world wide recognition.</p>
<p>There was a time when Aicher had acquired an almost guru-like status 
(especially when he just had had been killed by an accident. 
Untimely death can boost popularity and helps building instant-saints). 
This led of course to a counter-movement amongst some designers
who argued that Aicher had confused ideology with design.
Using or rejecting Rotis was for a certain time  at least in Germany 
and other German speaking countries - 
a demonstration whether one was pro or contra Aicher.
This time of hysteria is luckily over. 
One can only hope that now Aicher&rsquo;s achievements 
(as well as the limitations of his approach  are there any? Erik, what do you think?)
in his own design works  as well as in his writings can now be discussed 
in a more objective way.</p>

I do agree with you about Rotis, which seems to &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; an undeserved backlash these days.
About this &ldquo;rip off case&rdquo;, though I can spot the similarities between Pascal and Rotis, I don&rsquo;t think that Mendoza y Almeida would have paid a visit to a staunch functionalist like Aicher (I&rsquo;ve met him a couple of times, and I&rsquo;m quite sure he didn&rsquo;t know that the guy even existed until Rotis came out with a band at the end of the eighties).
But… haven&rsquo;t we already have this conversation ? Rings familiar to me…</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The only comment on Aicher’s claim of being ripped-off 
I found in typography books is in 
Hans Peter Willberg: Typolemik/Typophilie.</p>
<p>In this book Willberg, the German typographer and teacher

(in German, of course, this is my translation):
&lsquo;… and ever since the typographic world wonders about whom 
Aicher was talking about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The slightly ironic tone indicates that Willberg regarded this

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Gossip, maybe a little bit. But for me at least finding
out what Aicher was thinking (no matter that he probably
wasn&rsquo;t justified*) provides a glimpse into his head**, and
by extension the heads of creatives in general.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that he was an outsider/newbie in the world
of type design might explain an ignorance of how much of
what we do is derivative (often naturally/unavoidably so)
or just plain coincidental!</li>
</ul>
<p>** A really interesting head to boot.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another clue: I have a feeling that there
are people -certainly people who&rsquo;ve been exposed to
the speculation- who know the answer. The fact that
they don&rsquo;t share might mean the person is still alive.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the correction about the page, Ricardo.</p>
<p>Whereas it is great when important typography books get translated,
sometimes it is hard to maintain all the original context in which these books 
were written.
This chapter from &lsquo;Designing books&rsquo; was first published as a small booklet 
with the title &lsquo;Buchgestaltung als Denkschule&rsquo; (Designing books as a training 
of reasoning) - already the title suggested that some book designers were 
in urgent need of help in order to learn how to think. 
The subtitle of this booklet &lsquo;Gegen die Ideologisierung gestalterischer Strukturen&rsquo;
(Against the ideologization of design structures/principles) made even clearer 
from where the menace to reasoning came from: from ideology/dogmatism.</p>
<p>Aicher was quite dogmatic and articulate about his ideas,
but this does not mean that the traditionalists were less dogmatic.
It is just that their dogmatism had the force of habit on their side 
and therefore it was probably less obvious.</p>
<p>A lot of people got very obsessed with the question of symmetry versus asymmetry:
Paul Renner, Max Bill, Richard Paul Lohse, Karl Gerstner and 
Jan Tschichold (both the young modernist as well as the older traditionalist Tschichold)</p>
<ul>
<li>they all had something to say on this topic. 
The whole chapter 11 in Kinross' &lsquo;Modern typography&rsquo; is full of these debates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remarks by Hochuli on Aicher as well as Aicher&rsquo;s remarks on symmetry 
in his book &lsquo;Typographie&rsquo; are rooted in a long history of conflicts 
between traditionalists and modernists/functionalists - and the question 
of symmetry versus asymmetry made these different views again manifest.</p>

<p>Getting back to the original request &ndash; you might find this extremely informative in regards to Aicher&rsquo;s philosophy and process during the major corporate rebranding of FSB and ERCO (both in mid-eighties), with personal recollections by Juergen W. Braun.</p>

<p>I also started the process of gathering some of my own personal notes and correspondences related to period Aicher was in process of publishing <em>Typographie</em> and the development of Rotis type family. My intent is only to fill some critical facts which seem forgotten or lacking on the information, theories and criticism associated with Rotis.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know that the preparation and publishing of <em>Typographie</em> was happening simultaneously with the development of the Rotis typefaces. Aicher was commissioned to compile a record of his typographic experiences by Klaus Maack of Druckhaus Maack (major printshop in Germany since 1849), who also happened to be the CEO of <a href="http://www.erco.com" target="new"><strong>ERCO</strong></a>, the major high-end lighting manufacturer that Aicher was rebranding (with Rotis).</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>One thing to remember about Rotis is that it was Aicher’s first font.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>FYI &ndash; technically not his &ldquo;first&rdquo; but in actuality Rotis was his only type design effort, due to his untimely death.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiekermann.com/iblog/C1109747452/E1829097339/index.html" target="new">spiekerblog &ndash; Erik Spiekermann</a>
&ldquo;Aicher certainly didn’t do himself a favour by aiming so high with his first proper type design (he had previously adapted Univers for Bulthaupt and the Traffic typeface for Munich airport).&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have just finished reading &lsquo;typographie&rsquo; today. I have been working through it this last week. First-off, the English translation in Rotis Roman <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> difficult to read. It has been the first time I had read Rotis (Roman) in any quantity. There is an example in the book later on which shows the comparison between Rotis Roman and Times Roman and it becomes clear that Times is a significant influence from the Roman end of the scale.</p>
<p>The book lays out a <em>Big</em> argument about the adoption of capitalis by the Romans (and later Renaisance) with the usage of Capitalis' drawing an association to vacuous superiority. This is both interesting and enlightening as this had not been apparent, though subconsciously obvious.</p>
<p>Typographie, the Book is a fine example of &lsquo;Total Design&rsquo; in the true Dutch sense, where all aspects of the design work in a holistic way (typeface, illustration style page make-up). The only aspect of the book design that bugged me was a really tight gutter margin and some bad column return alliterations.</p>
<p>I have always admired what I have seen of Aicher&rsquo;s work and have his Sahara Desert book and essays (English and German) so am looking forward to the book from Markus Rathgeb.</p>
<p>Rotis as a font is a remarkable undertaking. I really like the concept of legibility being increased upon the increased distinction between letterforms and admire the notion of being inspired by pen-forms and early type design, especially the Garamond lowercase e (Carolingian minuscule). If we were to take these to starting points - would we end up with something so successful as Rotis, perhaps? But what is commendable is having the ideas and working them out and creating a font programme of 17 variants. It can be criticised but has yet to be superseded. I believe this is suggested as the eternal challenge to the typographer anyhow.</p>
<p>I wish I had read it years ago. An important book!</p>
