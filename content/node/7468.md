  body: Thanks for your replies. <BR> <BR>FInally, I found the author of this text,
    and you are right, it is a redraw made a lot of years ago &#40;maybe at the end
    of 80&#39;s&#41; and inspired in some old script fonts. <BR> <BR>Also, the text
    had distort after a lot of autotrace processes over the years &#40;I think&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks again.
