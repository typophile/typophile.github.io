<p>&hellip;.Erik Spiekermann says his favorite letter is the &ldquo;small a&rdquo;&hellip;I totally agree&hellip;.It is the most complex and has the most potential for variation as he says&hellip;.That is one of the reasons I have always been fascinated with the &ldquo;Galliard&rdquo; typeface, it is revolutionary since it dares to &ldquo;throw away&rdquo; much of the potential variation of the small letter a and replace that with just a uniform width straight line!!!&hellip;.INGENIOUS I say&hellip;..</p>

I was taught both Greek and English from birth but my first few years of life were spent in my grandparents house (where only Greek was spoken) while my father was away at WWII. I attended Greek School up in to high school as well so I was quite familiar with the Greek script.  I have no problem &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; and drawing the glyph forms of Greek because they seem quite normal to me.  I don&rsquo;t think it is a question of being &ldquo;scripty&rdquo; as much as being familiar.  The Greek theta is a glyph that is not particularly scripty but it is very strange looking to the non-Greek  because it is so very tall and thin compared to any English letter.  I would bet that the biggest problem a non-greek type designer would have was to actually be able to believe the theta was really that narrow.</div>

I use all 26 of the letters of the Latin alphabet to communicate with, and I just don&rsquo;t relate to them in a way that inspires me to single any one of them out.</p>
<p>However, just recently, I learned of a lonely orphan letter that needs a little help.</p>
<p>On [[http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/kyb04.htm|my website]], I have a page about various typewriter keyboard arrangements. Recently, I learned of the existence on the web of copies of a book I thought only existed in a lost manuscript. It was a Russian-language book from 1913.</p>
<p>And, thus, of course, it was in the old orthography, the new orthography only being decreed in 1918. This led to my becoming curious about how the change in orthography affected the Russian typewriter keyboard, and hence I made an addition to the page referenced above.</p>
<p>Even before this, I had run across claims that one of the letters eliminated from Russian, Ѣ or ѣ, &ldquo;yat&rdquo;, was not actually identical in pronounciation to the letter currently used for it, at least in some dialects of Russian, and indeed distinguished words distinct in meaning.</p>
<p>So I think that I will adopt &ldquo;yat&rdquo; as my favorite letter, at least at the moment.</p>

<p>Many years ago an academic requested that I add a letter to one of my Armenian fonts; he was writing a paper about pre-Mashtots Armenian and claimed that we used to have a sound like the Arabic ح (which I&rsquo;m not sure how to properly describe) that got lost when our alphabet was implemented. According to his research the word for &ldquo;lion&rdquo; for example (առիւծ, which sounds like &ldquo;arrouydz&rdquo;) originally started with that sound instead of an &ldquo;a&rdquo; sound (which actually makes sense if you know what ح sounds like :-).</p>

<p>and some other articles, where I see that it is symbolized by ḥ (Hmm.. the &ldquo;ḥ&rdquo; in Muḥammad!) or by ħ&hellip; and is at least one possible old pronounciation of the Hebrew letter ח .</p>
<p>If the sound was lost from Armenian before its alphabet was formed, then, unlike the case for the Brahmi family of abugidas, it may be hard to decide what the new letter for Armenian &ldquo;should&rdquo; look like.</p>
<p>Had Armenian been written with the Cyrillic script, then when there is no letter for a given sound in Greek, the practice of turning to Hebrew for inspiration already has a precedent: Ш. Unfortunately, that would imply the new letter would look like П, and that shape happens to already be taken.</p>

<p>That is why I provided the simple description of how the sound is produced: &lsquo;a sound produced by constricting the flow of air with the base of the tongue at the back of the throat&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The only way to accurately describe vocalisation is to describe how sounds are produced. The technical name is simply a shorthand for such description. Trying to describe what the sound sounds like isn&rsquo;t helpful, because different people will have a different sense of what is meant by e.g. &lsquo;it sounds like the beginning of gradually trying to clear phlegm from your throat&rsquo;. So one needs to talk about the parts of the vocal system and what is happening to produce a given sound, which can then be reproduced by anyone with a (physiologically normal) vocal system, even if the sound isn&rsquo;t part of his or her language. So, in this case, concentrate on moving the back of the tongue towards the back of the throat to constrict the flow of air, then pick a vowel and try to make a sound. :)</p>

<p>What does that mean? In whose orthography? That&rsquo;s my point: unless you have a description of how a sound is made by the vocal system, you&rsquo;re not really describing anything unambiguously meaningful. For instance, if I see &lsquo;kh&rsquo; I presume an aspirated velar stop, because that is what &lsquo;kh&rsquo; most often indicates in English orthography. But the same letter sequence might indicate something quite different to someone else (including, possibly, a pharyngeal fricative). This is why the IPA alphabet exists, to provide symbols that correspond to the specific descriptions of how sounds are made, rather than the ambiguous mappings of conventional alphabets.</p>

<p>Ah. So similar to the Arabic ح in that it involves constricting airflow between the tongue and another surface, but further forward in the mouth. I suspect a lot of English speakers trying to learn Arabic begin by trying to fake the ح sound with a velar fricative, because they&rsquo;re not used to making sounds so far back, in the throat.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I thought that the Armenian alphabet had a simple and uncontroversial origin, like the Glagolitic, from some obscure form of cursive Greek writing.</p>
<p>In seeking the materials from which Mesrop Mashtots worked, so that I might suggest how a voiceless pharyngaeal fricative would have been written in Armenian, though, I have found that it was not so simple.</p>
<p>Gardthausen favored Greek, but this was already deprecated by Taylor, who favored the advanced form of Zend found in the inscriptions at Kapur di Giri.</p>
<p>And there is the recent theory, mentioned in this forum, that there is more than a mere superficial resemblance between Ge&rsquo;ez and Armenian.</p>
<p>So I thought I would check on Glagolitic; surely the origin of that from cursive Greek is uncontroversial. And I found a paper suggesting that Cyril and Methodius would have been rather too late to have invented that script&hellip; because it derived from <em>Linear A</em>. Somewhere around Greece still, but&hellip;</p>
<p>However, Isaac Taylor at least also exhibits the presumed cursive Greek antecedents of the Glagolitic letters.</p>
<p>And while Mhedruli doesn&rsquo;t look much like Armenian, Hutsuri does&hellip; but am I surprised to see Georgian nationalists claiming Mesrop had nothing to do with the origin of their script? (Taylor feels he used a better version of Zend for the Georgians because with them he was working from a clean slate&hellip; the Armenians already using an inferior version of Zend to write with, Mesrop was constrained.)</p>
<p>&hellip;the Armazi script is proposed as one of the more likely alternative sources of Georgian; but I&rsquo;ve now stumbled on one source that says that it, rather than Zend, was what Mesrop used, in addition to Greek uncials, to create the <em>Armenian</em> alphabet!</p>
<p>At least with so many candidates, I should have no problem finding enough shapes with which to extend the Armenian alphabet so that it can be used to write Sanskrit.</p>
<p>And, of course, let us not forget the Albanians of the Caucasus (no relation to the Albanians of the Balkans) and the alphabet Mesrop gave <em>them</em>.</p>

In fact it&rsquo;s entirely possible that Mesrop might have have yelled &ldquo;What the Hell are you doing?!&rdquo; at those braindead copyists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which is highly plausible because the whole reason to invent the Armenian alphabet was in fact to fight assimilation, and copying other scripts goes directly against that.</li>

<blockquote>am I surprised to see Georgian nationalists claiming Mesrop had nothing to do with the origin of their script?</blockquote>
<p>Can you spot the key word in that phrase? :-)  Most Georgians had no problem accepting that an Armenian had designed their writing system&hellip; until we started demanding more respect for the Javakhk region!</p>
<blockquote>I should have no problem finding enough shapes</blockquote>

<p>Hmm. My thinking was simply that starting from a historical precedent, even if it came from a theory which would not withstand critical scrutiny, was an improvement on just making a shape up.</p>
<p>Your point is definitely valid; my first reaction was to think that this would simply be an after-the-fact constraint to ensure any new shape used is legible and distinctive. On further thought, however, there&rsquo;s also the issue of the learning curve.</p>
<p>Instead of digging into historical precedent to find out what Mesrop might conceivably have done, which did make sense for the original intended application as I understood it, <em>if</em> one was talking about adding new letters to Armenian for widespread adoption (which, incidentally, I&rsquo;ve learned has already happened twice since Mesrop) the proper example to follow would be that of the Initial Teaching Alphabet, so as to avoid a steep learning curve.</p>
<p>That is, any new letters ought to resemble, although being differentiated from, existing letters related in sound, so that it would be immediately obvious what they were for.</p>

<p>Yes, the Օ and Ֆ&hellip; both of which are out of character with the rest of the alphabet (with the former also being a sad case of script-borrowing). Mesrop would never have made those that way; they are products of multiple levels of ignorance.</p>
<blockquote>any new letters ought to resemble, although being differentiated from, existing letters related in sound</blockquote>
<p>This is a classic conundrum for anybody contemplating the invention of letter symbols. Learning and doing are not the same, and are often at what I call &ldquo;90 degrees&rdquo;, meaning they pull in somewhat different directions. A symbol that&rsquo;s easy to &ldquo;figure out&rdquo; because it resembles the shape of a similar sound becomes harder on readability when efficiency gets factored in (think speed and parafoveal depth) once you no longer need to make the connection. So,which to favor? Or rather: where to strike the balance? Which BTW is the beauty and power of Hangul: you can easily learn the basic alphabetic components that join to make up the 2-4 letter syllable shapes, but once you know a compiled syllable shape you can read much faster without bothering with the letters. And this is exactly a power that comes from conscious design, unlike the headless-chicken evolution typical of most scripts.</p>
<p>For example, is it good that the words &ldquo;opposite&rdquo; and &ldquo;apposite&rdquo; have opposite meanings?  :-)</p>

<p>This seems to be a distinct sort of question from that regarding letter shape. Almost all languages have root systems that link related words, even if the relationship is one of opposition as in this case. Sometimes, these root systems are reflected in pronunciation, often in spelling (even when pronunciation changes) and sometimes both.</p>

<p>No, I counted that as <em>once</em>, although since it happened in the Middle Ages, the two letters could have been added on separate occasions.</p>
<p>The second time, at least according to Wikipedia, was և (a ligature for եւ, I suppose) and ՈՒ (or ու in lower case) which, although looking like a digraph, is counted as a new letter.</p>

I&rsquo;m a reform-minded person myself, but even more important is Intent, and it&rsquo;s no secret that the Soviet intent with the reform wasn&rsquo;t to help kids learn spelling faster, it was to further alienate the homeland and the diaspora.

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>I used to call it &ldquo;bicameral&rdquo;, but Kent convinced me (via Bringhurst IIRC) that that&rsquo;s better reserved for describing writing systems with two cases (such as Latin and Armenian).</cite></p>
<p>Using bicameral in contexts other than referring to legislative systems with a House of Commons or Representatives below, and a Senate above, risks confusion.</p>
<p>For example, are we talking about a &ldquo;g&rdquo; that hears voices?</p>
<p>Yes, that was a reference to <em>The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind</em> by Julian Jaynes.</p>
<p>Actually, though, Kent&rsquo;s advice makes sense - for discussions here, such as about the problems of Greek typography, it would be useful to have a quick, unambiguous term for writing systems with an upper and a lower case.</p>
<p>If we were to call the Latin script <em>polymorphic</em>, to take into account upper and lower case, small capitals, and italics, though, then we would run into another problem. Just about <em>any</em> script can be bolded for emphasis - i.e. there&rsquo;s no problem with having a bold version of Chinese characters. (And they certainly can be optically slanted as well, although <strong>that</strong> somewhat collides with Chinese typographical conventions. Also, Song typefaces could be considered analogous to Roman, with Kai typefaces as the equivalent of italic.)</p>
<p>Lower case is clearly more fundamental to the Latin script than the weight variations used for emphasis - and small capitals occupy a strange intermediate position.</p>

Why does it collide with the Chinese typographical conventions? I never bothered to ask why some scripts seem less sophisticated when it comes to features and typographical capabilities. I can certainly see why the Chinese scripts don't have small-capitals, but I can barely imagine not having different ways to emphasize and distinguish and having wide ranges of weights.
<p>By the way, I know the movable type system was first introduced in China but somehow I never realized how tedious printing must have been for such an elaborate logographic systems. Does anyone know how optical sizes were employed? Is this perhaps a reason why the typographic capabilities in such systems have never been expanded (as simply adding different pt sizes for the whole logographic system would have been an absolutely tedious job), or is there inherently no need for it?</div>

<p>In the traditional script orientation, italicization would not be sloping the characters in the direction of reading, which may be significant.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Many years ago an academic requested that I add a letter to one of my Armenian fonts; he was writing a paper about pre-Mashtots Armenian and claimed that we used to have a sound like the Arabic ح (which I&rsquo;m not sure how to properly describe) that got lost when our alphabet was implemented. According to his research the word for &ldquo;lion&rdquo; for example (առիւծ, which sounds like &ldquo;arrouydz&rdquo;) originally started with that sound instead of an &ldquo;a&rdquo; sound (which actually makes sense if you know what ح sounds like :-).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Martin, the Armenian lowercase հ is my &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; because in most designs (especially these days) it is a glyph that&rsquo;s fully Latinized, and the furthest from what it needs to be; this is partly because its authentic form is so intractable (which to me actually makes it valuable) and also because it&rsquo;s the same sound as the Latin &ldquo;h&rdquo;. But as a result of the debasement it suffers, the հ is also the key to our typographic salvation. When enough of us start making it correctly, it will mean we&rsquo;re finally on the right track again.</p>
<p>The fact that it&rsquo;s the first letter of my name is a bonus.  :-)</p>

Tossed out of the English alphabet like a couple of lost boys from a polygamous sect, they&rsquo;ve hung on for years in Icelandic living a lonely and isolated existence. They might not be the prettiest letters or the most fun to draw, but I feel sorry for them and think they deserve a second chance.</p>
<p>Maybe I should also feel bad for all those old Cyrillic letters that were cast aside, but I don&rsquo;t. Most were ugly, deformed and deserving of a dignified burial.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One problem is that the distinction between voiced and unvoiced <em>th</em> in English is no longer phonemic. So if English did feel a need to have a letter for &ldquo;th&rdquo;, they would probably take the Greek theta instead, it being more well-known, since only one letter and not two are wanted.</p>
<p>The lower-case version from Greek, though, wouldn&rsquo;t fit with the Latin alphabet well, so they would likely take the lower case of the Cyrillic letter removed from Russian by the new orthography instead! (So that gives us Ѳѳ.) And they would probably take the <em>sh</em> letter Шш and the <em>ch</em> letter Чч from current Russian, and maybe also <em>zh</em>, Жж, since these are other sounds used by English which don&rsquo;t have a single letter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I was wondering what on Earth a [Dd]croat was, but I see that Croatian has the letter Đ or Đđ (U+0110, U+0111) which (in upper case) does look a lot like an eth, Ðð (U+00D0, U+00F0), as opposed to a thorn, Þþ (U+00DE, U+00FE). In looking those up, though, I see there&rsquo;s another forgotten letter - wynn - Ƿƿ (U+01F7, U+01BF) for which we might long.</p>
<p>And not far from Wynn, there&rsquo;s an African D, Ɖ (U+0189) as well!</p>
<p>Ah, but Wynn simply represents the same sound as the letter W; like Thorn, it was borrowed from the runic alphabet. So, since we already have W, there&rsquo;s no demand for Wynn.</p>
<p>Still, that suggests that the rune Ing could be used as the basis for adding a letter to the Latin alphabet for the consonant cluster -ng at the ends of some words.</p>

Personally, I would welcome the substitution of |w| with a “proper” letter: it always seemed to me a bit of “frankenglyph”, or a very bad case of keming*. Ugly, uninspired, underdeveloped, and too wide. One exception is perhaps the cursive “asymmetrical w”: https://www.flickr.com/photos/52362783@N00/6129692536/
