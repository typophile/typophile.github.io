  body: I would venture a guess that, whatever the typeface, the S is a chop job.
    If you look at the lettering within the bottom of the black circle, it appears
    to be the same style as the initials, but there the S is stylistically what one
    would expect to see with the other letters. The large S may be a reworked dollar
    sign, or a grafted inverted question mark.

    Schoolbook.

    possibly: another source may well be Craw Clarendon Condensed. The bottom of the
    S might well come from the numeral 3 in that face."
