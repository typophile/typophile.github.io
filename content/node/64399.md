  of the 50th FontFont release, FontShop International introduces <strong>FF Mach</strong>,
  a geometric, constructivist sanserif family by <strong>\u0141ukasz Dziedzic</strong>
  from Warsaw (FF Clan, FF Good, FF Pitu). With three widths, six weights, an extensive
  pan-European character set (Latin-Extended plus Cyrillic) and a set of glyphs designed
  to create \"virtual ligatures\" (accessible through the OpenType \"dlig\" feature),
  \u0141ukasz has created a versatile, powerful display family. Unlike many constructivist
  typefaces, FF Mach does include a true lowercase, which makes it also suitable for
  setting shorter texts. \r\n\r\nFF Mach shows its decorative potential in a small
  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/lukas834/sets/72157622440799276/\"><em>graphic
  book \"Machloye\"</em></a> by Cracow-based graphic designer \u0141ukasz D\u0105browski
  that has been featured on \"Lettra \u2013 Sign and Letter\" exhibition as a part
  of the International Print Triennial in Cracow. FF Mach has also been recently used
  in the identity of an exhibition <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.iwp.com.pl/projekty_wystawy_wartosc_dodana_wiecej_informacji_galeria_wernisaz\"><em>\"Added
  value. Global design from Poland\"</em></a> held at IWP in Warsaw. \r\n\r\nFor more
  information, see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=409\"><em>announcement
  of FF Mach at Unzipped</em></a>. \r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nAdam"
