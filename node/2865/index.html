		<div class="commentbody">What a lot of people don't seem to realize is that a script like the one posted above is not a trivial thing to turn into a font. The complexity of just those two words is beyond what you would normally find in a font. For example, <BR> <BR>* The two capital letters are not the same height. <BR>* The trailing letters&ndash;the &quot;e&quot; and &quot;n&quot;&ndash;would not work in the middle of a word, and the internal letters would not necessarilly work at the end of a word. <BR>* The way the &quot;C&quot; overhangs the &quot;a&quot; would not work next to a character with an ascender, like an &quot;h&quot; or &quot;l&quot;. <BR>* The connecting stroke between the &quot;o&quot; and &quot;r&quot; would probably have to be treated as a ligature. In any case, it is difficult to incorporate an &quot;r&quot; like that into a font. <BR>* The connecting stroke between the &quot;i&quot; and &quot;f&quot; is wider than the others to make room for the crossbar on the &quot;f&quot;. <BR> <BR>This is not to say that some or all of these issues couldn't be resolved such as by adding alternate characters and ligatures. Unfortunately, users often don't know how to use such fonts.  <BR> <BR>For example, many of House Industry's script fonts have special characters and ligatures to overcome problematic situations. Yet, I often see these fonts used&ndash;even in design annuals&ndash;as if the designer had no idea these special characters existed. <BR> <BR>You can also design a script font in such a way to avoid features that don't work with certain combinations, but at the sacrifice of many of the qualities that give hand-drawn lettering its appeal. <BR> <BR>OpenType promises to make such complex scripts easy to use, but, so far, support is uneven. Yet, even when there is full support for complex fonts that can emulate custom lettering, it won't change the fact that if you want something unique, you won't get it by simply typing on your computer keyboard.</div>

I like it, but I did it quite quickly using skeletal forms over my pencil sketch in FreeHand, but the client discarded it (together with a few others), in favor of a re-design of the previous logo of this product, which was a badly rendered version of Laser from Letraset, designed by Martin Wait. So, I just had to make my boss buy Laser and I spent more time in reworking and adjusting it to make it more &quot;friendly-logo&quot; and less &quot;typeface&quot;.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/25279.gif" alt="Buona_logo"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Doyald Young, on his site (<a href="http://www.delphipress.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.delphipress.com">www.delphipress.com</a></a>) summed it up well. <BR> <BR>If there are thousands of fonts, why handletter or modify a font to create a logotype? Because every company desires a distinct image for itself and its brands, which is unique and copyrightable, an important point. A custom logo is one of of a kind, precisely fashioned. One of the many design approaches, are logos that carry an identifying shape, or illustration. But the majority of commercial logos exist as name only and must rely on their letterforms to impart a distinctive image that the public will remember.  <BR> <BR>Commonly used fonts such as Times Roman, Garamond, Baskerville, Helvetica, and Univers are available to everyone, and because they are seen everywhere, their distinctive qualities are diminished by the boredom of repetition. These same fonts though, may be gently modified to create a more coherent and distinctive logo that is reproduceable in a range of sizes, positive and negative, and on a wide variety of surfaces. <BR> <BR>A custom logo, handlettered or computer generated, must address only the letters that the name contains. Each letter can then be designed for maximum compatibility, a less daunting task than font design, where each letter of the font: caps, lowercase, figures, punctuation, and special characters, must be designed as a harmonious group. <BR> <BR>Whether the logo is drawn by hand, or is completely designed on the computer, a thorough understanding of letterforms is vital for the successful resolution of a logo that is eminently usable, with a lifespan of 15 to 20 years. <BR> <BR> <BR>At his AIGA presentation, he said that drawing letters on the computer isn't drawing, <BR>it's clicking. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Right, and I suppose writing on a computer is just  <BR>pressing keys.</i> <BR> <BR>This reminds me of one of the most dreadful events  <BR>I experienced in my career as a graphic designer.  <BR> <BR>At the end of my last year of the Applied Arts at  <BR>the Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent, I presented my  <BR>&quot;eindwerk&quot;. As I had been working as an intern for  <BR>FontShop for over half a year by then and was  <BR>freelancing since my second year, my presentation  <BR>consisted of all kinds of graphic design pieces,  <BR>all done on an Apple Macintosh. Computers had  <BR>just been introduced at the Academy by my last year  <BR>(think Adobe Illustrator 3 and Photoshop 1-era),  <BR>and I had had exactly 2 (two) hours of computer  <BR>training in total (which is why I skipped classes  <BR>and got that internship at FontShop). <BR> <BR>Now those 4 or 5 teachers are looking through my  <BR>rather extensive portfolio, and suddenly one says: <BR>&quot;Well, we can't grade you because we don't know  <BR>the possiblities of the software&quot; <BR> <BR>The world stopped. Here I was, ready to graduate,  <BR>having invested all my time and energy in computer  <BR>assisted graphic design for the past two years and  <BR>those guys who are about to decide about my future  <BR>just told me they're going to flunk me because they  <BR>were convinced there was a magic key on that  <BR>computer keyboard which said &quot;Nice Design&quot;?!&hellip; <BR> <BR>Lucky for me, my computer teacher who was standing  <BR>next to them replied: &quot;It's not because you don't know  <BR>all the types of brushes and paint that you can't judge  <BR>if a painting is any good.&quot; <BR> <BR>I graduated. FontShop hired me that summer.</div>
