  body: "Hi Dick! Please stay awhile. Your determination to make a digital version
    of every good image of old alphabets posted at abf really impressed me. For example
    the Hunt books. Too bad that after Character passed away nothing of interest is
    posted there. Only the occasional pirated commercial font. BTW my persona of the
    abf era has also passed away -- I no longer make free fonts...\r\nDon"
