  you consider both correct? Or is it a country-specific thing? Or is one more modern?
  More scientific? More informal?\r\n[Note that I am not interested in the 24h vs
  am/pm question here.]\r\n\r\nWhat about minutes and seconds? Is one minute and a
  half 1:30 minutes or 1.30 minutes? Does it depend on the context? Can you mix both
  principles for hours and minutes?\r\n\r\nCurious about your opinions."

    by a period \u2013 though everybody write it with a colon. No one ever use old
    style figures when they're supposed to neither, so I guess it's just plain ignorance."

    is just a guess, someone is bound to know the correct answer.'

    language, \"Kielenhuollon k\xE4sikirja\" by Iisa, Piehl and Oittinen, it's advised
    as follows: hours.minutes.seconds, hundreds of seconds. \"Paavo Nurmi's unofficial
    Finnish record in marathon was 2.22.02,08.\" \r\nThe use of colon is SFS-EN 28601
    standard, and mainly used between communication systems."

    for nine seconds and 45 one hundreds of a second.

    (British) all use a full point, and those in the Chicago Manual of Style (American)
    all use a colon. So notwithstanding Oxford's wrong statement about Scandinavia,
    it certainly does look like a geographical preference. As Tim's in the UK, if
    the audience of the document in question is as well, then 9.45's the way to go...\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: From what I remember (I don't know where I read this), the centre dot is more
    corectly used to denote decimals, and the lower full-stop is for time. (Well,
    in the UK at least.)

  body: "\r\nThanks for your comments, everyone.\r\n\r\nI personally would have gone
    for paragraph's logic that the full-stop is for decimals only, and that 1.50 is
    always one and a half, not ten to two or one hour and fifty minutes. Interesting
    to hear that the convention is different in some countries, and that's what counts,
    of course.\r\n\r\nSo, how would Paavo Nurmi\u2019s marathon record be written
    in the UK then? 2.22.02.08, I guess?\r\n\r\nBert, I also think the centre dot
    is cool, at least in cases where there is no risk of confusion. I have seen it
    used on the clock on an oven recently."

    this exactly the unqualified opinion that is 100% useless. You need to put in
    some wheres and whys for it to make any sense. Your note on French does that cover
    Swiss-French usage, only one, or both? What about Canadian-French?"
