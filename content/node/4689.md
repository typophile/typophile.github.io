body: 'Hello everybody. <BR> <BR>Maito Recordings is an upcoming <BR>on-line based
  music label, which <BR>releases music free, downloadable <BR>directly from our main
  website. <BR>The Maito Recordings focuses in <BR>experimental sound landscapes and
  <BR>ambient music, electronic and acous- <BR>tic. <BR> <BR>&#40;note: the word &#34;maito&#34;
  is finnish <BR>and means milk&#41; <BR> <BR>Having some hint on graphic design,
  <BR>I decided to try out and make the <BR>logo all by myself. <BR> <BR>The emblem
  resembles a milk stain, <BR>from a glass of milk, which somehow <BR>tries to represent
  the idea of aeste- <BR>thics in chaos and randomness. The <BR>way the music is created
  &#40;ambient, <BR>noise, drones etc.&#41; what i&#39;ve <BR>discovered, is quite
  often based on <BR>randomness. Well.. that&#39;s the basic <BR>idea behind the emblem.

  <BR> <BR>Now comes the hard part. Typography. <BR> <BR>  1. Kerning. How can I improving
  it? <BR>  2. Composition between logotype and emblem? <BR>  3. Alignment between
  &#34;maito&#34; and &#34;recordings&#34;? <BR> <BR>In the logotype sans is Univers
  Thin Ultra Condenced and serif is Bembo. <BR> <BR>All advice is warmly welcome.'
