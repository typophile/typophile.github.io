  body: It could simply be a bitmap font with some post-processing. The rounded corners
    at the junctions can be created by rasterizing the type, applying a carefully
    calibrated Gaussian blur, then adjusting the levels to eliminate the intermediate
    tones. Or, it may be a font that emulates this effect.

    Vormgevers (designers) was the title of the exhibition that the poster of your
