  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

A friend of mine asked me to design a new logo for his business. The business is essentially a job agency and the name is derived from the English word "time" and its German equivalent "zeit". 

Please have a look at the attached file and let me know what needs further improvement. Thanks a lot for any input!

It took me a while to see what it was supposed to be. Why does the guy at the top left not have his arm behind the guy at the top right?

I'm also not sure that the combination of 4-fold rotational symmetry and a German name is a good idea - the negative space <cite>sort of</cite> looks like a swastika.

		<div class="commentbody">OK, you are right. The implementation was a bit of a nightmare here, though I'm still convinced that the idea itself should work quite well, if it is implemented with more attention to detail. Please have a look at the changes I just made:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6203.png]

In an earlier thread I had explored some other concepts, most of them with a clock in it, however this is a people business, not a clock business. So I thought including a human element in the logo would be a good way to go.

To eliminate any ambiguity here, I could reduce the number of people to three. But there wouldn't be any resemblance with a clock then...

This is an idea somebody else came up with in an earlier thread:

I like it a lot but it makes the company look like a watch business, no?

		<div class="commentbody">Is there going to be a tag line used? It may help you determine whether you need an icon or not with the logotype. I think your latest post is interesting.  although the space between the "i" and "m" looks too loose to me.

"I like it a lot but it makes the company look like a watch business, no?" 

but with the name Time Zeit won't people automatically think of watches and clocks?

It may be over done and too complicated for your mark but the time 9:00 - 5:00 "9 to 5" typically represents a work day (here in the states anyway. I would assume other countries have a similar phrase) I'm just throwing this out there to get you thinking about time, people and work in more meaningful ways.

The posting prior to the straight typographic solution, had lost the swastica look to me (and actually looked more like a button). That is what happens with symbols, people attach cultural and personal meanings to them. I think you deftly altered the mark to erase any connections to a swastica. How do you feel about that design? I get the sense that you prefer the 4 people concept over the logotype.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This new iteration (blue and black) is much better. It actually looks a little like a compass now. I also don't think that reducing the number of men to three is a good idea - it will look a lot like the ubuntu logo then.

What does your one colour version look like?

An idea - if each of the four guys had two hands, there would be a total of twelve dots around the circle, like a clock. Don't know if this will work, look good, or whatever, but just a thought.

It is too much and the second colorpallette (blue, flesh and black) doen't work for me.

Aaaah, now I see the 4 men.

The reason why it could be so difficult to see is because of the bright white.
It gets a lot of attention.

Perhaps you could alter it so that the 4 men get all the attention?</div>
