body: "Hi there :)\r\n\r\nI was hoping anyone here could help me identify a font my
  client wants to use for a horror show. The font looks sort of satanic. The capital
  letter \"S\" has a devilish tail attached at the bottom, the \"t\" looks like a
  tall catholic cross, and the \"o\" has a cross inside it. The lower case \"i\" appears
  in two different hights.\r\n\r\nAny help would be tremendously appreciated! Thanks,
  Tanya\r\n\r\nPS If anyone can recommend another satanic/devilish type font, that
  would be great too![img:sites/default/files/old-images/SatanicFont_4675.jpeg]"

    is my favourite font to use for this project, in Dutch it means "rude/obnoxious".
    Perfect :) Cheers, Tanya
