    what about Foundry type? Form Sans / Monoline?  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/"

  body: Thank you very much for your suggestions they are both interesting. <BR>When
    working on a small budget is there a way to try several fonts on  a design without
    purchasing them right away?  I know that I can test drive a font or download a
    PDF but are there other options?  <BR>B
