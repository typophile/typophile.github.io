body: 'Administrators/Moderators/Users, <BR> <BR>I think there are some things that
  could be done to make the forums a bit easier to use. Here are some issues I&#39;ve
  found off the top of my head: <BR> <BR>&#60;ul&#62; <BR>&#60;li&#62;Place a &#34;Start
  New Thread&#34; button/link at the top of the page.&#60;/li&#62; <BR>&#60;li&#62;Increase
  the width of the &#34;Post&#34; box&#60;/li&#62; <BR>&#60;li&#62;Make &#34;HTML
  code in message&#34; object more robust. For example, &#60;em&#62; and &#60;strong&#62;
  tags are not supported &#40;they&#39;re actually more typographically/semantically
  correct&#41; and one is unable to add a &#34;title&#34; attribute to anchor &#60;a
  &#62; elements.&#60;/li&#62; <BR>&#60;li&#62;<i>ibid</i>&#60;/li&#62; <BR>&#60;li&#62;Speed
  up the frickin Posting script. While previewing a post is relatively fast, posting
  takes FOREVER! My browser hangs for well over a minute and I&#39;m on cable modem.
  This is surely a server/script issue.&#60;/li&#62; <BR>&#60;/ul&#62; <BR> <BR>Just
  thought I&#39;d mention this stuff and welcome others&#39; suggestions so that we
  might further enhance the productivity of this already rich and thriving community.

  body: 'Sorry if I posted this in the wrong place. Feel free to move it over to the
    &#34;Non-Typographic&#34; folder. <BR> <BR>I have another usability suggestion
    having to do with the navigation design of the forums. While it&#39;s nice to
    have a bread crumbs trail that shows where one is in context in the forums, it
    would be <i>really nice</i> to have a persistant subnav that allows typophiles
    to jump from topic to topic witout having to click &#34;Topics&#34; in the global
    navbar. <BR> <BR>For example, say I&#39;m in a thread in &#34;General Discussions&#34;
    and I want to go to the &#34;Type Identification Board.&#34; Currently I have
    one of two options: <BR> <BR>1. Click the back button twice to get to the top
    level. Then click &#34;Type Identification Board.&#34; That&#39;s three clicks.
    <BR> <BR>2. Click &#34;Topics&#34; and then click &#34;Type Identification Board.&#34;
    That&#39;s two clicks. <BR> <BR>Why not set up a persistant subnav that links
    to the most popular topics, i.e., <BR>General Discussions | Design | Critique
    | Type Identification Board <BR> <BR>This would allow users to get there in &#40;you
    guessed it&#41; ONE click. Even better, let users customize the subnav to display
    the topics they visit most often. <BR> <BR> -t'

    of this site I think that would be a bad idea. <BR> <BR>James

  body: Thanks for your input- its always appreciated. We have a major revision in
    the works in which we hope to make some big improvements for Typophile.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ll see what we can do about speeding up the posting script. As I understand
    it, its due to the large number of people who receive each post in email, so the
    script that bundles up the email and sends it is what causes the delay. <BR> <BR>Actually
    the best place for this type of feedback is in the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4110/4110.html">Respond</a>
    forum.
