    request.\r\nBTW I can't name \"curiosity\" offhand, but it looks awfully familiar.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "You're welcome Akira.\r\nAnd \"curiosity\" is indeed  answered.\r\nThe A2-Type
    website provides an interesting mix of well designed retail fonts & commission
    work. This seems to be a good way for studio size font makers to operate.\r\nDon"
