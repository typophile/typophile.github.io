body: I just saw madonna live in nyc and during the song Spanish Lesson they have
  all the spanish words projected behind her in some cool + really beautiful font.
  i unfortunately have no image of it, was wondering if anyone has seen it and can
  tell me which font it is?

    you should go to www.myfonts.com\r\nand then you use the keyword arabian for the
    search. This will show you two pages of suitable typefaces, some of them available
    at Myfonts, some of them with links to the foundries. All of them come really
    cheap."
