  body: '[[FF City Street Type]] is based on the signs of East and West Berlin. I
    also prefer that [[eszett]] to the more common form. Less confused with a B or
    Beta and more attractive as well.'

  body: Yeah, exactly, Stephen. It is much more clear, it is just a long-s and a z,
    basically. Instead of the odd looking B.
