  am going to make a fake poster for a friend who asked me to make one for him...
  \ but I cannot figure out what kind of type they use. Maybe it is something they've
  invented themselves? the \xC4 and \xD6 and A with an \xB0 on top must be specially
  made for their headlines.\r\n\r\nAnyone who could recommend something for me to
  use? I can make the \xC4 and \xD6 and A with an \xB0 on top myself in illustrator.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Are you sure the newspaper\u2019s name isn\u2019t <a href=\"http://www.expressen.se/kvp/dagens-kvallsposten/\">Kv\xE4llsp<strong>o</strong>sten</a>?\r\n\r\nThe
    typeface looks like some home-brewn Futura to me \u2013 probably custom(ized).
    If you are looking for a similar retail font with such compact diacritics, see
    Scangraphic\u2019s Supertypes Series, labeled with SH \u2013 e.g. <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-zwprBg\">Futura
    SH</a>. This series started in the 1980, i.e. before OpenType. The compact alternates
    are still not properly encoded as alternates, but can be accessed via ~ (tilde)
    for \xC5 and { for \xD6. In the early 1990s, URW released its Poster series. In
    <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-0X8lia\">Futura P Extrabold</a>, such integrated
    accents are the default.\r\n\r\nAlbert-Jan Pool kindly provided me with this information
    for my recently published <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/fancy-diacritics/discuss/72157633790076349/\">article
    on unusual umlauts</a> for TypoJournal."

    body: "Yes Florian..  'pesten' in Swedish means 'the plague'. I amn't particulary
      found of their journalism, that's why I call them that.\r\n\r\nThanx..  I will
      use Futura and modify it a little."

  body: "If you purchase Trim Poster this is what you get for outlined accents similar
    to the sample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrimPosterRingUmlaut_4509.jpg]\r\nAnd
    other accents:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TrimPosterMoreAccents_3583.jpg]\r\nThe
    font in your sample is more rounded than Trim Poster -- similar to Futura -- but
    you can see the technique from the sample if you want to make your own accented
    capitals in illustrator or a font making program.\r\nThis only works for very
    large headlines. I would have used more white space to make it more useable for
    smaller headlines.\r\nDon"
