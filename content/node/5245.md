    Are there plans for a companion italic? <BR> <BR>David Thometz '

  body: ' Nice start, Ryan. My two cents: <BR> <BR>- The diagonal of the Z needs more
    weight <BR> <BR>- Some of the upper case characters, like E,F and L seem a little
    flat -- literally. Consider applying some of the calligraphic touches in the lower
    case to these UC characters. '

  body: ' There are of course &#34;plans&#34; for an italic, but that&#39;s a ways
    off right now. I&#39;m pretty happy with the lc and I agree that the UC still
    needs some work. I&#39;ve tried to &#34;liven&#34; up the E,F etc but nothing
    seems right so far. Ideas? '
