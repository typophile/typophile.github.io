body: I am 21 years old and next may i will be graduating having completed a graphic
  design hnd. <BR> <BR>We have an end of year show at &#39;the workstation&#39; Sheffield,
  where Designers Republic are based. <BR> <BR>The reason i am posting is to ask advice.
  . . <BR> <BR>Even though a few design consultancies and agencies come along to the
  end of year final show which is highly recognisable for being a good standard, i
  have been thinking about something else. <BR> <BR>I am quite a good designer, i
  dont mean to be modest but i may have a junior design job secured for next january,
  have had my work exhibited in a gallery in London, and a few designers say the overall
  quality is good. <BR> <BR>Putting that aside should i send out a promotional pack
  to design agencies throughout the UK, fairly near Sheffield, to invite people to
  come visit me and hopefully with my portfolio i might secure some interest. <BR>
  <BR>I am just trying to take some initiative, what does everyone think?

  body: Any ideas onm approaches, what i should say, what i should send etc etc etc.
    I am quite creative, my personal stationary is a Sagmeister rip off but effective
    as i cut the word create into my leg photographed it then printed it on skin textured
    paper.  <BR> <BR>I was just wondering whether there is an CD or senior designers
    out there, what would you like to receive from a student, what would make you
    want to go see a show see someones work etc etc im trying to think lateral with
    this lol as always get under the skin see what would make someone in industry
    make a special trip just to see our show and my work etc etc.

  body: It was not for that purpose.  <BR> <BR>Basically i call it a sagmeister rip
    off because it is what he did, but! <BR> <BR>I personally did it because i feel
    i can express my personality in a much more profound way then sticking &#39;alex
    haigh creative design&#39; in helvetica neue on a business card, i dont think
    there is any design in minimalism when it comies to business cards as the worlds
    full of them. <BR> <BR>My representation was to suggest i am extremely passionate
    about what the industry i am hoping to enter, the fact that design is skin deep
    for me and it is not just &#39;a job&#39;, i wanted to give it a meterphoric meaning
    show my future employees how i try to express design not just aesthetically but
    with ideas to. <BR> <BR>As for secure job, it isnt &#39;secure&#39; as i go on
    a trial week, if i get offered a job by a better agency or better pay or personal
    circumstances for me then i will take it, i am trying to make myself as employable
    and &#39;wanting&#39; as possible. <BR> <BR>Yes i fully understand no CD or SD
    will have the time, so thats why i want to create something that could possibly
    open doors for me.

    and impress all those highly creative creatives, but I think being, stating and

  body: Hi <BR> <BR>Over the past ten years I have had quite a bit of experience of
    this, from trying to find a job, to interviewing for my own agency. <BR> <BR>I
    found that the best route was to call up and ask if people could spare 15 minutes
    to look at my work. I never asked for a job, just for advice. <BR> <BR>Next, when
    I went to visit an agency I would ask if they could recommend any other good places
    to approach. Sometimes they would call up and make an appointment with friends
    at other agencies for me. <BR> <BR>My business partner loves it when people send
    a letter thanking her for seeing them. She gave a job to someone for that reason
    once. <BR> <BR>From your point of view, you should be asking for placements. Try
    and line up a whole string of them, most people will pay you something. This puts
    you top of the list if a job does become available. <BR> <BR>From the hiring point
    of view, I like to see good work. But  a lot of people have good work. I want
    someone who wants to learn more... so I would never say that you think you are
    good. <BR> <BR>I personally think that most graduates don&#39;t try to find work,
    they might mail out a cv, or a CD-ROM, but if they really want a job they have
    to put in more work. The only way to find work is to get sat down with your folio
    in front of someone. If you get a placement, just make yourself really useful,
    not only in terms of design, but by offering to cut stuff out, buy coffee, anything
    which makes you look like you&#39;ll work your &#149;&#149;&#149; off. <BR> <BR>Good
    Luck <BR> <BR>Jim <BR>=== <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.sumodesign.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.sumodesign.co.uk</a>

    <BR> <BR>Yeah that is my whole point i am going to write to companies in and around
    my area thanking them for the personal stationary samples they sent me, then i
    will include a cool little flick chart booklet of my work, make it really nice
    just a thankyou, then they have the address of the show and if they want to they
    can come along. <BR> <BR>By saying i was good i am not being arrogant mearly pointing
    out the fact im not a graphic design student that just wants to do for example
    taking up sport when leaving school, for the sake of it, i was basically just
    trying to emphasize the fact that  i am passionate etc etc etc.

  body: To get one over on your competition try and learn more about print production,
    for example, always a sticking point for graduates. <BR>Instead of rip off, refer
    to it as a homage, though whether a potential employer will think &#39;passionate&#39;
    or &#39;stalker&#39; is another matter. <BR>&#34;the fact that design is skin
    deep for me and it is not just &#39;a job&#39;&#34; <BR>The saying is more than
    skin deep, meaning it goes deeper. Check your invitation carefully or better still
    get someone to look at it critically; your presentation could be let down by bad
    grammar or spelling. <BR> <BR>Still, best of luck <BR>Tim

    Pip, <BR> <BR>AS <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>The Boy With The Moon And Star On His
    Head <BR> <BR>Written By: Cat Stevens <BR> <BR>A gardener&#39;s daughter stopped
    me on my way, on  <BR>the day I was to wed. It is you who I wish to  <BR>share
    my body with, she said. We&#39;ll find a dry  <BR>place under the sky with a flower
    for a bed And  <BR>for my joy I will give you a boy with a moon and <BR>star on
    his head. Her silver hair flowed in the  <BR>air laying waves across the sun Her
    hands were  <BR>like the white sands, and her eyes had diamonds  <BR>on. We left
    the road and headed up to the top of <BR>the Whisper Wood And we walked &#39;till
    we came to  <BR>where the holy magnolia stood. And there we laid <BR>cool in the
    shade singing songs and making love... <BR>With the naked earth beneath us and
    the  <BR>universe above. The time was late my wedding  <BR>wouldn&#39;t wait I
    was sad but I had to go, So  <BR>while she was asleep I kissed her cheek for  <BR>cheerio.
    The wedding took place and people came  <BR>from many miles around There was plenty  <BR>merriment,
    cider and wine abound But out of all  <BR>that I recall I remembered the girl
    I met &#39;Cause <BR>she had given me something that my hear could not <BR>forget.
    A year had passed and everything was just <BR>as it was a year before... As if
    was a year  <BR>before... Until the gift that someone left, a  <BR>basket by my
    door. And in there lay the fairest  <BR>little baby crying to be fed, I got down
    on my  <BR>knees and kissed the moon and star on his head.  <BR>As years went
    by the boy grew high and the  <BR>village looked on in awe They&#39;d never seen  <BR>anything
    like the boy with the moon and star  <BR>before. And people would ride from far
    and wide  <BR>just to seek the word he spread I&#39;ll tell you  <BR>everything
    I&#39;ve learned, and love is all... <BR>he said. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: CS_theboy-54468.unk*attachment_icon.gif*application/octet-stream*96.8**CS_theboy%2emp3
