  off more than the first post of a new\r\nthread, and buggily to boot) or revert
  to the perfectly\r\nfine email delivery method?\r\n\r\nUsing the tracker is major
  pointless overhead.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I agree. I didn't even know there was any sort of tracker. I had bookmarked
    threads I wanted to watch, and then came back to them later to see if anything
    new had been posted.

    in addition each thread could get its own feed, so we can follow particular discussions?\r\n"

  body: "My vote is for two general tracker feeds: the existing feed that tracks new
    threads, and one that tracks all threads plus all replies/comments.\r\n\r\nSubscribing
    to your own user tracker feed is also useful. Find it on your profile page."
