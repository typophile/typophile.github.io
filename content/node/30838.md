body: "Hi there everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a font, preferably a serif, with
  a unique upper case K. I've found that ITC New Baskerville Italic is kind of interesting.
  Anyone have any other options? Thanks!"

  body: I really like the way the rounded serif of the angled right ascender closely
    echoes the counter space created in the angled right descender. I may just alter
    the character by hand to create a true equality in the shapes of the two. I don't
    know if that helps you any.  :-)

  body: "Your best chance to get that sort of symmetry is to look for fonts where
    the legs of the K meet on the stem, instead of on the upper leg, as in Baskerville.
    you will also need a full foot serif on the lower leg.\r\n\r\nExamples: New Aster
    Bold Italic; Cushing Italic; Janson Italic and Glypha Italic (for a slab type).
    These are just examples. Having the legs roughly equal in weight also helps reinforce
    the symmetry of the counters, I think.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
