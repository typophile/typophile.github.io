body: I have the &#34;light&#34; and &#34;black&#34; version of this font. I need
  to buy the regular and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s its called. Can anyone help.
  I can buy a new font group if someone can suggest something similar. <BR> <BR>Thanks,

    to make it look like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/blue-highway-deluxe/">Blue
    Highway</a>. If so, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find the latter both more authentic
    and better constructed.

  body: A couple more suggestions. An <i>extremely</i> nice font with a similar style
    is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/">Avenir</a> &#40;also
    by Adrian Frutiger&#41;. See also <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/granby/">Granby</a>,
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/shinn-rr/">Shinn RR</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/extension-rr/">Extension RR</a>,
    each of which has a slightly different flavor.

    is less geometric; but has obvious similarities, including the angled cuts.
