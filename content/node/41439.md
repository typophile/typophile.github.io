    And an en space is half an em space (so in the same example, a font is 10 pts,

  body: "While all the technical data above is correct, there is a movement for making
    the em dash slightly wider than its escapement, giving a small sidebearing on
    either side, so that it does not crash into o and other letters that have small
    or no sidebearings. \r\n\r\nThat said, doing this prevents you from putting several
    dashes in a row, and having them join (without kerning). Three ems is used in
    bibliographies to indicate the same author as the item above, for instance."

  body: I read all about the size of em. But there was hardly any info about the sizes
    when designing in Fontlab (TypeTool). True that nowadays dashes are drawn with
    sidebaring. Still, I'm not sure if my em-dash should be 1000 UPM wide.

  body: "\"Still, I\u2019m not sure if my em-dash should be 1000 UPM wide.\"\r\n\r\nMost
    fonts I know of are produced with a \"3/4 em dash\", not an Em dash, and, this
    may be confusing. There was no type designer present at the formation of the glyph
    sets to tell the techies that most users and uses were not going to want a 'real'
    Em dash, so we  who need to solve problems, not argue about technicalities, said
    dash'em, and made the right character, which is a full em space, with 1/8 em sidebearing
    on either side of a 3/4 em wide dash.\r\n\r\nIf you are working on a face that
    is considerably less wide than 'regular', then you may also need to consider the
    widths of \"M\" and \"N\" as guides for your dashes, and then make the EM vs.
    3/4 EM descision. The same is true in the wider direction, if you are working
    on a face considerably wider than 'regular'.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Let's talk about the visual appearance of dashes for a moment, not numbers.
    You don't have to go back too far in typographic history to find the time before
    the em-system.\r\n\r\nVisually, the \"em-dash\" was about as wide as the widest
    capital letter -- sometimes an \"M\", more often a \"W\".\r\n\r\nThe \"en-dash\"
    was about as wide as a figure.\r\n\r\nThe hyphen was about as wide as a lower-case
    \"i\" (which was about as wide as a word space, in the days when you always added
    space to justify a line).\r\n\r\nIf you talk to an old Linotype operator (some
    are still living, and the linecaster didn't use the \"em\" system), he's apt to
    tell you that an em-space is about the size of a capital M.\r\n\r\nMoving to the
    current em-system, the technial \"width\" (setwidth) of the dashes is more or
    less fixed, 1000 units for an em-dash (on the 1,000 unit UPM), 500 units for an
    en. How much of that inside space (ink + sidebearings) is filled with ink is your
    business.\r\n\r\nAs Dan said, you will need two- and three-em dashes.  Unless
    you write a kerning or ligaturing routine, that prohibits sidebearings. But, there
    are not many fonts I can think of where the capital M (or W) is 1,000 units. So
    my solution is to make a dash with ink about the size of M or W, set the width
    to 1,000, and make two ligatures for a two- and three-em dash, with no sidebearings,
    so if you need a 4- or 5- or whatever em dash, you can set it.\r\n\r\nI usually
    make the ink of an en-dash look right with a figure, and set the sidebearings
    the same as a hyphen, as an en-dash is also used between alpha charactes on occasion.
    It's width will usually be around 500 units, but if that works out to 550 or 450,
    I don't sweat it.\r\n\r\nFWIW "

  body: "I have long been of the understanding historically, if you go back to foundry
    metal type (before hot metal), the em dash wasn't part of the typeface, but was
    a separate \"sort\" and was the same width as the point size. In fact, that's
    why its width was independent of the typeface.\r\n\r\nI certainly agree that typeface-dependent
    sizes probably look better in many cases. At Adobe we still largely adhere to
    the standard that an em dash should have an advance width equal to the UPM, however.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    metal type. Most fonts of that era, and up until the 1980's were made of 80-90
    characters and all the rest were sorted in from a limited variety of options,
    usually 8, (sets of accents, reference, secondary punctuation and etc., though
    not &). The upside of this was a consistent user experience with the downside
    that design suffered ever so slightly. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    as with (Chicago's example) \"quasi-public--quasi-judicial body.\" (I think an
    em dash shows here, but s/b an endash.) If you are using lining numbers & a higher
    en-dash, it would stick out. If you also switched on a raised-up hyphen, it would
    be too high for lower case letters.\r\n\r\n*case* is usually no problem, just

    of monetaries and arithmetic signs for Whitman; they've been there from the beginning.
    And they'll be switched out with appropriate onum/lnum features. \r\n\r\nSubstituting
    raised dashes with {case} is pretty much a no-brainer. The trick with the endash.uc,
    as Charles mentions, is that if you use a straight substitution for it with the
    {lnum} feature, then it will also appear in running text. Although the occurrence
    of an endash outside the context of a number range is not common, it still occurs.
    \r\n\r\nSo, the solution currently in mind is to contextualize the substitution
    with a statement something along the lines of \"sub @lnum endash&#039; @lnum by
    endash.uc\".\r\n\r\n-- K."
