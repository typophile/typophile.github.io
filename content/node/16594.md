  body: "Thanks to both of you!\r\nWith Hellenic as a starting point, I did some digging
    and found <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/hefty.htm\">Hefty</a>
    wich I think is the font used on all but one of the posters above. The Largemammal
    Print \u201CFRANZ FERDINAND\u201D poster I think might use <a href=\"http://helloproduct.com/type.html\">hello_caleb's
    Ethan font.</a>\r\nSo thanks again."
