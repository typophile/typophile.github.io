  longer. The pages of the forum are taking tons of time to load. Last night I gave
  up after 7 minutes (I have a broadband cable connection). Every other site in the
  world seems to load faster than Typophile.\r\n\r\nIts all I can stands, and I cant
  stands no more.\r\n\r\nJames"

    (Chris) confirmed he had the same experience. I am also broadband. It has got
    much worse since we posted a few weeks ago. --I would look back to the date, but
    it will take too long! '

  body: I'm having the same problem and I am using Safari 2.0.2  I can load just about
    any other site quickly and I was able to load Typophile quickly until this week.
    I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one experiencing this.

  body: Safari 2.0.3, Mac OSX 10.4.4. Extremely, maddeningly slow. No other site is
    loading this slowly for me, nothing is even close in load times. Must be why the
    numbers after Hrant's and Dezcom's names are dropping....
