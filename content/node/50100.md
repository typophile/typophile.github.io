body: "typeface advice request: sans serif for rebrand \u2014 I need a great 'g'!\r\n\r\nThis
  is a request for help. I will appreciate your offers of advice. I am redesigning
  an existing logo, the concept will stay the same, but I am changing the typeface.
  Currently it is Trebuchet and it is weak and unbalanced. \r\n\r\nI cannot say what
  the actual letters are due to a confidentiality agreement, but there are two lowercase
  'i's, an uppercase 'S', and a lowercase 'g' in the name. As the only descender in
  the word, the 'g' will garner the most attention. \r\n\r\nI would very much appreciate
  suggestions for a solid sans serif, strong and forward thinking. This company is
  creating cutting-edge communications technology, I aiming for strength, clarity,
  spaciousness, and professionalism. And a great lowercase 'g'. \r\n\r\nIdeally I
  would like a face that has a strong family that I can use as their corporate typeface,
  or perhaps a great pairing of a family with a face used only in the logo. \r\n\r\nI
  look forward to hearing some opinions!"

    feel. And it's a huge font family.\r\n\r\nBut I could not possibly find any other
    font to complement it."

  body: "If you have such a great desire for a great 'g', would you not be better
    off having the whole logo created anew from the get-go, as original art? That
    way you have control of the whole project. You can get versions that will work
    large, small, reversed, 4-colour, 2-colour, screen, billboard, etc.\r\n\r\nThen
    you can devote your energy to finding the corporate typeface that will pair best
    with your brand-new, original, unique logo.\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of types to choose
    from, but that does not mean that the right 'g' for this logo exists among all
    the sorts for all those faces.\r\n\r\nSo find a good letterer to create your logo.
    There's a strong heritage of working that way.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Thanks for the input. Pill Gothic's 'g' is nice. Thanks for that lead. I'll
    consider it. Kabel is a little too... too... difficult for this. A custom 'g'
    might just be the way to go. \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, due to a confidentiality
    agreement I can not publish any details about the company at all. And we all know
    how everything on the web is public.\r\n\r\nThe target audience is made up of
    investors, advertising agencies and large retailers. Not consumers. The product
    is an advertising technology.\r\n\r\nThanks for your kinds word everyone. It is
    nice to get others' perspectives. I wish I could get more input! "
