body: A great loss occurred to the typographic community this past weekend. Evert
  had already given us such great typefaces. From his last few posts on Typophile,
  one could easily tell that he was a very generous and kind man with much more to
  share. He will be greatly missed.

    I have had a very insightful conversation with Evert last year. He was a wonderful
    man.  <BR> <BR>Adam

  body: I can&#39;t believe it -- just last week I re-read some of his articles on
    his site... Inspiring, knowledgable, eclectic. <BR>In my mind Evert is one of
    the truly original type designers and his death is a great loss. <BR>Was, of course.
    D&#42;&#42;&#42; shame.

  body: I am deeply saddened by the loss of this young and gifted designer. But, more
    than anything, the world has lost a kind and warm person who contributed greatly
    to our community and to those around him. My deepest sympathies to his family.

    the bar for the rest of us.

    which half we should be sad about more. <BR> <BR>The more time passes, the more
    we will owe him, I have no doubt. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: "And again I miss him. \r\n\r\nAs his students we all wrote a few lines to
    commemorate him. I described him as a genius wearing a workman's overall of modesty.
    ('Een genie in een stofjas van bescheidenheid') It doesn't translate well into
    English, but this is what he was.\r\n\r\nI seriously doubt I will meet a person
    combining total seriousness with gentle playfullness in that way ever again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nMy
