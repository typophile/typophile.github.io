  in their <a href=\"http://www.moo.com/start.php?pid=149&tpl_0=businesscard_front_textomatic\">Business
  Card Designer</a>. I've ran it through WhatTheFont and gave Identifont a shot as
  well, but they didn't turn up with anything.\r\n\r\nHere's an image:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_4449.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  a ton in advance!"

  body: Er, does that mean that Moo.com is using an Adobe font on a web server and
    renaming it, violating its license in two dastardly ways?

  body: I'm not sure about the renaming part, but I don't think they are necessarily
    violating the EULA.
