  body: "Here is my impression. Over all it seems really strong. Here are my suggestions
    for maybe improving it. Really, I don't know that they will:\r\n\r\n\u2022\_Maybe
    make the N a little wider. \r\n\u2022 I like the Q but I wonder what more could
    be done with it. It is a huge graphic opportunity\r\n\u2022 The ch - I wonder
    if the top of the c might bend down a little to help it read as a 'c' a bit more.\r\n\u2022
    Maybe let the 1st M be a little bigger and let it be spaced a little farther from
    the 'a'.\r\n\u2022 What if the C on the inside was a bit rounder?\r\n\r\nSweet
    work!"

    OK, then it's fine. :-)  But you can have an \"\xF1\" like that\r\nwithout a vowel
    following? I guess if you're a rock band you can.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "i like the letterforms better in this new variant, because they're 'funkier'.
    i think the cursive elements to the 'm', 'k', 'c', and 'a' all lend to increased
    tension within the graphic.\r\n\r\nbecause elements of the letterforms are at
    odds with one another, but not overtly so, this new version feels more dynamic
    to me.\r\n\r\nbut what's with the completely different spelling of the name? is
    it intended to be phonetic?"

  body: The spelling change is a bit odd, but I also like the 'chunkier-ness' of the
    second variation. Foating the tilde accent helps as well. The only nitpik I have
    is that the 'Q' seems to be a bit too dominant.

  body: The new one is good too but the 1st thing I thought of was what if the A shapes
    were lc 'a'. I bet it would be streonger & more legible that way. Peronally I
    like the dominant Q. I don't know why. Maybe because it's funky.
