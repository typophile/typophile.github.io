body: 'Hello all. Please let me know if this has been answered elsewhere. <BR> <BR>I
  need to set a sentence with an em dash. But, because of space reasons, the sentence
  needs to break. How would I set something like the example below? Does the em dash
  go to the top line or the bottom one? <BR> <BR>example <BR>blah blah blah-- <BR>blah
  blah etc <BR> <BR>OR do you place it like so: <BR> <BR>example <BR>blah blah blah
  <BR>--blah blah etc <BR> <BR>I remember seeing an article that covers this situation
  but I can&#39;t seem to find it at the moment.'

  body: I would go for example 1, if only because it looks better with the <BR>left
    alignment and maybe reads slightly clearer.

    text blocks &#40;not to say Illustrator is em dash god, though&#41;.'

  body: 'Felici&#39;s &#39;Compete Manual of Typography&#39; says that much typesetting
    software sees an em or en dash as an appropriate place to break a line. So I guess
    the first would be the common wisdom. <BR> <BR>Bringhurst in &#39;Elements of
    Typographic Style&#39; recommends using en dashes to set off phrases,with a word
    space before and after. The em dash he recommends using only to introduce dialogue
    &#40;beginning the sentence&#41;, which he says is the European practice. '

  body: True. Example 1 does look clearer. I&#39;ve gone this route for my em dash
    example. Thanks! <BR> <BR>I remember having a link at home, somewhere, explaining
    all the rules regarding em and en dashes in breaking lines such as this. I&#39;ll
    post it as soon as I find it.
