  at the over 50's age group. The demographic is increasing exponentially and over
  the next 7 years someone will be turning 50 on average every 7 seconds. They also
  have a large degree of free time and of course all important - a large disposable
  income!\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a body font which is very readable, sophisticated,
  modern and warming. I also need to come up with a proposed name for the title -
  so any suggestions would be very welcome!"

    font that I'm very fond of: Adobe's Warnock Pro. Readable, sophisticated, lots
    of weights and a beautiful italic.\r\n\r\nCheck it out:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1709.html\r\n\r\n-M"

  body: "Thanks. For the initial design I'm going to have to use a font from the adobe
    library - until I can sell in a new face. Warnock is something I hadn't considered
    - thank you.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions particularly adobe stuff?\r\n\r\nBy
    the way what are people's feeling towards the adobe library - as we have a lot
    of new publications, I'm buying in the library so we have a good base and can
    use the opentype fonts on the pcs and macs - thoughts?"

    ranges of type in opentype. I think you would be better off looking around and
    getting to know more sources.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
