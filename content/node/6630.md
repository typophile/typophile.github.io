  body: Well it kinda looks like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdisplay&amp;displayfontid=FF.11132.0.0&amp;packagefontid=0&amp;view=package&amp;searchID=0&amp;searchby=keyword&amp;searchletter=A&amp;searchstr=trade&amp;totalrecords=30&amp;startrow=1&amp;records=20&amp;currpage=1"
    target="_blank">Trademarker</a> from FontShop ... but only kinda. The Y and the
    S are wrong for starters.

  body: Tony, Is this from a professional sports team? <BR> <BR>If so that would explain
    &#40;probably&#41; why no one has ID&#39;d it. Most pro team logos and lettering
    are custom font designs and may only have been lettered for those words, without
    necessarily developing a complete font. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s see if anyone else
    knows, but that might explain the slow thread.

  body: Naaaw Mike, it was an old logo from a high school team, I assumed they used
    a font rather than something custom.  I&#39;ll try the Trademark font with some
    adjustments. <BR> <BR>Thanks!
