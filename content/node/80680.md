  never really tried myself at this discipline.\r\n\r\nI recently started thinking
  about a simple sans-serif font, based on my natural way of drawing letters. So I
  opened a [[http://typetip.tumblr.com/|Tumblr]] to document my creation process and
  share some studies on well known sans-serif fonts (mainly Helvetica, Futura and
  Century Gothic). What you'll find now is pictures of some of my very first drafts
  and visual studies of those fonts (comparing sizes, angles and so on, trying to
  understand their logic). And hopefully you'll find in some weeks/months/years a
  final OTF file for you to download.\r\n\r\nHere's [[http://typetip.tumblr.com/|the
  site]]!\r\n\r\nI'm well aware that this kind of process can be long and hard so
  I don't really know where I'll end, but for now I feel enthusiastic and am looking
  for feedback if you have some!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    studying typefaces like Helvetica or Futura it might be worth exploring a Bembo
    or Garamond the same way, or even the engraved lettering of some [[http://mediendesignkurs.de/Projekte/Schriftgeschichte/kapitale.gif|old
    Roman inscription]]. \r\n\r\nWondering why I recommend those? \r\nObserve e.g.
    the *skeleton* of the classical Roman R with your pencil, and then compare it
    to the skeleton of Helvetica\u2019s or Futura\u2019s R. \r\n\u2013 Then you\u2019ll
    probably see why."

    give a serious look at sans-serif typefaces because mine will most likely look
    like one of them; but I get your point and I can now see the benefit of also studying
    serif ones! Of course I'll be more interested in their skeleton (as you call it)

    getting their serifs tickeld by tiny little Bauhaus circles \u2013 are plain kitsch.
    Nice to look at, but silly.\r\n\r\nA letter is not a construct. Let\u2019s get
    to the bottom of it. \r\n\r\nA letter is a <cite>written shape</cite>. It is a
    graph, and a graph in the true sense is the trail of a tool\u2019s movement (a
    pen, a brush). The origin of all letters of all writing systems is the moving
    human hand. A letter by its very nature is the result of a hand\u2019s physical
    movement, its characteristic rendering dependant of tool and material. It is not
    the result of any construction process.\r\n\r\nOne may compare (!) an A to a triangle

    first idea which is keeping close to my initial and natural draft and trying to
    fit it into what a major sans-serif font looks like.\r\n\r\nFor example my M's
    vertex didn't touch the baseline when I first drew it, but I noticed most of the
    sans-serif fonts have a baseline-touching vertex. So I sticked with my first draft
    but pushed the vertex a little further to make it look more \"regular\"...\r\n\r\nI

    poor \u201Cme-too\u201D geometric inspired by Futura (particulary Twentieth Century)
    & Avant Garde. If you are going to compare sans-serifs, I would rather pick a
    humanist. That way you can compare differences in grotesques (Helvetica), geometrics
    (Futura) and humanists (x). It might also be wise to consider a more pure grotesque
    like Akzidenz Grotesk. Helvetica is more of a neo grotesque (not a real classification
    per se, but a <em>humanistification</em> of the grotesque genre).\r\n\r\nThe most
    typical humanist sans serif I can think of is Frutiger."

    both Helvetica and the constructed alphabets mentioned above. Even it is as simple
    as learning from shortcomings. There is plenty to observe in Helvetica, if you
    bother to look, it does not matter that it does not <em>please</em> you. Look
    at Akzidenz too, because it will tell you something about Helvetica, some nuance
    that escapes you until you really chase it down. If you are serious about designing
    alphabets you will look at <em>all</em> type/lettering with an open mind and will
    be continually reevaluating designs (including why they don't appeal to you or
    why they are problematic), else you are just repeating tropes. \r\n\r\nIn short
    you will learn more by looking at Helvetica than by not looking at it, so long
    as it doesn't beguile you.\r\n\r\nI'd look at the original drawings of Futura
    and Helvetica (or \"adaptation of drawings\", Nick Shinn, if you pick up this
    thread ;-)) and not at the digital files. The digital outlines are full of red
    herrings - I mean about the placement of points and handles etc. The intention
    of the designer is much clearer in the drawings, if not as measurable."

    In hindsight it would have made for a painful website as my progress learning
    was slow. I think I might still do the same but retrospectively, and in print.
    I am looking forward to how you flesh out the archetype shapes you have drawn.
    Very different conclusions can be drawn from the same skeleton.

    It has not become a model, which would mean that some kind of development departs
    from it subsequently. And I do think, especially when advising beginners, we should
    make it quite clear that \u201DHelvetica\u201C is not the prototype of typefaces,
    although some inherited practice of computer vendors of late seem to silently
    suggest just that.\r\n\r\nOf course, the study of everything can be instructive.
    No doubt. But those who ask for basics to be known should by no means be left
    with weak end-of-age-products like Helvetica to look at."

    is up to you really - working from hairlines helps in a small way as you fix the
    archetypal shape in your head, however drawing this shape with two contours, not
    one line, is quite a different experience. I personally work from a central line
    for my sans serif drawings but a lot of the Typophilers don't believe in it :-)
    Also this is not the same as a hairline - imagine the central line for a bold
    font - the bowls won't touch the baseline as they will in your hairline drawing."
