  forums</a>, and was marked not-a-font, but I'm convinced it is. There are differences
  in the letters, but I think it's one of those very nice fonts with tons of contextual
  alternates. The designer may have done some tricks too like condensing a few letters,
  moving points, etc. Some letters seem too perfectly identical for it to be done
  by hand. \r\n\r\nAlso it's part of a fairly recent series from the past 5 years,
  so it might be a font that was hip around 2003. Help would be appreciated, I want
  to buy it if I can find it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4793.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: Hand calligraphy for books and film is not uncommon (nor was it in 2003 when
    contextual alternates were very rare). What reason do you have to believe this
    was made with a font?

  body: "I was wrong about the age of the book, it was published in March of '06...
    \r\n\r\nbut in retrospect I think you might be right.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning was
    that the e's and the cap H's are too consistent, I superimposed them in photoshop
    and they're seemingly exact, or as exact as can be figured from this low res sample.
    So are the r in harsh and heron. The he in \"The\" matches the other he's, just
    condensed.\r\n\r\nBut the strong argument against: The other covers have this
    same style of calligraphy, and the letters are different yet again from each other
    and from this over. Like this one has three different s's and none of them match
    the s in this sample:\r\nhttp://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/images/n11/n55153.jpg\r\n\r\nSo,
    I guess for now scratch this one. The designer should certainly think about making
    it a font tho :)"

    She does the initial script with a brush but then digitally manipulates it so
    some letters will be duplicated.\r\n\r\nI can't find her website that I remember
    looking at last year, but here is her flickr page: [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ruth_rowland/]]"

  body: "wow, I'm really impressed... you recognize specific people's lettering style
    (as well as fonts I assume)... that's awesome. I think you're right.\r\n\r\nThere's
    another case on the WTF forums that's been nagging me for a while, what's your
    opinion on this:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=118868\r\n\r\nThere
    are identical letters and nobody found a font for it. Seems unlikely Mrs. Rowland
    would be commissioned to write this sort of thing."
