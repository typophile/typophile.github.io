    for the life of me, I can't find a good use for it. It's fantastic and strangely
    compelling but, so far, it goes unused.\r\n\r\nLos Feliz is on my shopping list.
    Where is Emigre these days?"

    the running. At the rate he's turning out excellent work, another five years could
    warrant a whole 'nother award. \r\n\r\nMuch like Mozart, CS has gone from wunderkind
    to virtuoso. (Let's just hope he lasts longer ;-)\r\n\r\nBravo! indeed.\r\n\r\n--

    \r\n\r\nDon't want to side-track the lovefest, but are there any type deisgners
    on the cusp who might have been deserving (not more deserving than CS, just deserving)
    of the prize? Also isn't 35 the upper limit on American Idol? ;-) "

  body: I suppose if they'd skipped CS in this round, someone else may have popped
    up in the next few years to rob him of the prix - so I think they did the right
    thing in awarding it to who they considered the best designer, even if he is still
    a young pup.
