  Swat4.\r\n\r\nThis font seems basic, except for the \"S\" and \"T\" that seem to
  be unique and I've had a hard time finding a font that looks like them.\r\n\r\nHeres
  a link for the pic:\r\n(sry best I could get the pic to look)\r\n\r\nhttp://img174.echo.cx/img174/2029/swat4logopic3bi.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  font that could get close to this would work for me as well,\r\nthanks in advance
  for any help you can give.\r\n\r\n"
