    is a must, depending on which one you go to they'll have a hundred on tap and
    several hundred in bottles.\r\n\r\nWhen are you heading to Atlanta?  I get back
    to the states in a week and frequent ATL especially on the weekends."

  body: I don't know Atlanta but I often find the map-based, user-reviewed guides
    at yelp.com helpful on trips (e.g., [[http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=vegetarian+food&ns=1&rpp=10&find_loc=atlanta|Atlanta
    vegetarian spots]]).

  body: "*smacks forehead*  Duh.  I originally wasn't planning on being back so soon
    so I just glazed over the date when it was announced and have been unfortunately
    ignoring it ever since.\r\n\r\nAnd as for half-eaters, most restaurants will have
    something on the menu, but since I enjoy my top-of-the-food-chain eating habits,
    I dunno 'em :-)  It's gonna be hard to eat Southern food without meat, potato
    salad often has bacon bits, collard greens'll have hamlock or bacon, same with
    black eyed peas.  \r\n\r\nOther local restaurants that are good (serving more
    southern foods) Silver Skillet is quite good, near Tech's campus.  As is Mary
    Mac's Tea Room and The Colonnade (the latter does not accept CCs).  A friend recommended
    Fat Matt's for ribs and chicken (I've not been).  Bridgetown Grill is if you're
    looking for something more carribean-ish (with wonderful pineapple bread)\r\n\r\nIt's
    essentially a requirement to go to the Varsity, even though the food is about
    as greasy as it can get.  For drinks if you can swing the time World of Coca Cola
    is the Taco Mac of sodas."

    States early, I hope you'll consider frequenting on over to ATL on the weekend
    of 16&#150;19 July and joining us! It would be a pleasure to meet.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: I'm strongly considering it.  The main things I have to check are finances
    (I'm in between graduation and the money-making job) and the dates I'm going to
    see family in Alburquerque (parents and sis already bought the tickets).  We'll
    be leaving out of ATL though so...  It would be great to meet everyone I've gotten
    to know on here even though I'm just a hobbiest.

  body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nLet me know where you guys are getting together, I'd
    love to come and meet you in person.\r\n\r\nI live in Atlanta, grew up here, went
    to college here, been here 30 years (except for those 3 years I can't talk about
    without blowing my cover)\r\n\r\nKnow that Atlanta is not really a city, but a
    collection of semi-urban areas that sprawl for miles and miles and miles in all
    directions around the heart of downtown Atlanta.\r\n\r\nAtlanta is *not* a typical
    Southern town. It is quite cosmopolitan. There are a *lot* of people here from
    every country you can think of: lots from Eastern Europe, Middle East, Asia, and
    South America.\r\n\r\nPlease don't read Gone With The Wind and come here expecting
    the same, you won't find it in metro Atlanta.  You may if you go outside the perimeter,
    in which case, you're on your own.\r\n\r\nNote about transportation: you need
    a car or a cab. The bus takes forever and the underground is not spread out enough
    nor is it efficient.\r\n\r\n<strong>Best steaks?</strong>\r\n\r\n(pricey)  Fogo
    de Chao - hands down amazing! (Buckhead)\r\n(a little pricey) Rathbun's - great
    steaks! (close to East Atlanta)\r\n\r\n<strong>Best sushi?</strong>\r\n\r\nRu
    Sans (one in Midtown, one in Buckhead)\r\nStarfish (Buckhead)\r\nThai & Sushi
    (in East Atlanta)\r\nSushi Avenue (in Decatur)\r\n\r\n<strong>Best Thai?</strong>\r\n\r\nTamarind
    Seed (in Midtown)\r\nRama 5 (in Buckhead)\r\nSurin's (in Virginia Highlands)\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Best
    burger?</strong>\r\n\r\nFlip (in Midtown)\r\nAtlantic Grill (in Midtown)\r\n\r\n<strong>Best
    seafood?</strong>\r\n\r\n(pricey) Atlanta Fish Market (in Buckhead, it's not a
    market, it's just a restaurant with that name)\r\n\r\n<strong>Best vegetarian?</strong>\r\n\r\nCafe
    Sunflower (in Buckhead)\r\n\r\nnote: vegetarian options are available now in most
    restaurants\r\n\r\n<strong>Best sandwich place?</strong>\r\n\r\nAlon's (in Decatur)\r\n\r\n<strong>Best
    nice little place to eat?</strong>\r\n\r\nCarroll Street Cafe (in East Atlanta)\r\n\r\n<strong>Best
    laid-back club/bar?</strong>\r\n\r\nCosmo/Lava (in Midtown)\r\n\r\n<strong>Best
    techno club?</strong>\r\n\r\nOpera (in Midtown)\r\n\r\nDon't forget to visit the
    Georgia Aquarium if you have time. High Museum, if you want a museum. Piedmont
    Park and Stone Mountain, for outdoorsy types.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have other
    questions.\r\n\r\nRahim\r\n\r\np.s. If you are here for a few extra days, please
    rent a car and drive down to Savannah (2.5 hours by car) and stay at a bed and
    breakfast. You will really enjoy it. It's really nice, lots of restaurants, nice
    art scene, Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD).\r\n\r\n"
