    blurb:\r\nSnell Roundhand was created by Matthew Carter for Linotype in 1966.
    The design is based on the handwriting of Charles Snell, an English writing master
    who wrote The Pen-man\u2019s Treasury Open\u2019d in 1694.\r\nLinotype blurb:\r\nLate
    in the seventeenth century, the English writing master, Charles Snell, decried
    all flourishes in the Puritan tradition and stood for a plain and efficient form
    of roundhand. The large x-height of these unadorned forms suited the purpose of
    the English roundhand, the standard commercial hand of the developing economic
    revolution, the typewriter face of its day. The overhangs on these letters were
    too large to cast in metal, blocking evolution to typography. Flourishes on the
    more elaborate forms could be adapted to fill body space, reducing or eliminating
    overhangs, allowing flourished scripts to appear in type. In 1966 Matthew Carter
    translated Snell\u2019s script for photocomposition, later adding two more weights.
    With its large x-height and severely graceful texture, Snell, impossible in metal,
    appears as the most typographic of photocomposition scripts.\r\n\r\nTake your
    pick.\r\nDon"
