		<div class="commentbody">I think Mystique and Method are opposed. Formality impedes instinct. Just drawing your font takes care of all that &quot;concept development&quot; and &quot;research&quot; stuff (assuming you're not just reviving/remixing something that already exists). On the other hand, doing research into things like readability is useful as a foundation - that any many other things (like exposure to the work of others over time) implicitly guide your drawing anyway. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Miguel <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>In idle moments I more or less &quot;write&quot; letters with a soft (4B) flat sketch pencil. This is a habit of a lot of years of comping layouts in pencil. In the early days, a person developed a representative sans and a roman etc. that could be used in a layout, and substitiuted for almost any typeface that was decided on in the production process. <BR> <BR>I save all the doodles, and go through them from time to time to find out what I think will work as a type. <BR> <BR>The scale I work at mostly is about a 3/4 to 1 inch x-  height. Once I have cut in with a fine point to delineate the forms. <BR> <BR>People work in many different ways. Whatever it takes to get there is good if it works for you. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dear H?ctor, <BR> <BR>one of my teachers ones told me , after I asked him 'how can I explain people, why we need new typefaces', typefaces can be like cars. There are cars for every purpose you can think of and still, they always can be designed better. <BR> <BR>You should try to think of a purpose/task, which your typeface should fullfill. Then you'll probably have enough to research about. <BR> <BR>For example:</div>
