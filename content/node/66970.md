body: "Named after its original creator, typeface designer Sumner Stone, the new 24-font
  ITC Stone\xAE Sans II suite of typefaces expands range of widths and weights offered
  by the original ITC Stone Sans design. \r\n\r\nIn his role as lead designer and
  project director, [[http://www.fonts.com/AboutFonts/DesignerProfiles/SumnerStone.htm|Sumner
  Stone]] collaborated with Jim Wasco of Monotype Imaging and typeface designer Delve
  Withrington to rework the original ITC Stone Sans design. One of the objectives
  was to include an expanded range of widths and weights. \u201CThese fonts had enjoyed
  great popularity for many years \u2013 during which graphic designers repeatedly
  asked for more weights and condensed designs in the family,\u201D said Stone. \u201CTheir
  comments were the impetus.\u201D\r\n\r\nITC Stone Sans II comprises 24 typefaces,
  including six weights ranging from light to extra bold. An italic counterpart and
  suite of condensed designs complements each of the weights. The ITC Stone Sans \u201Csuper\u201D
  family of 48 typefaces includes the original ITC Stone Sans design, along with the
  ITC Stone Serif, ITC Stone Humanist, ITC Stone Informal and now the ITC Stone Sans
  II typeface families. ITC Stone Sans can be viewed online on a wide range of websites
  including www.fonts.com, www.itcfonts.com, www.linotype.com and www.faces.co.uk.
