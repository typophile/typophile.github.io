  characters. I just love it!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights\r\n\r\nI
  am actually looking for a similar typeface (with what some might call a \"nice and
  'trendy' modern sans design\") that includes cyrillic glyphs, with a wide variety
  of weights (especially light or thin).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions ? :)"

  body: Have you been in touch with the vllgrs? Some designers are just sitting around
    waiting for an important client to ask them to do a Cyrillic for one of their
    fonts.

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions !\r\n\r\nI actually e-mailed Village and Chester
    replied saying only romanized Russian was supported. Not cyrillic.\r\n\r\nBut
    he also said he has made a start on these glyphs. The Book weight is pretty much
    done, and he's open to work on other weights (depending on the budget). \r\n\r\nThat
    guy is so cool !\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I need the font very quickly (the document
    has to be printed in 2 weeks)...\r\n\r\n- - - \r\n\r\nAnybody have more typefaces
    to suggest ?"

    New presently only contains the Latin alphabet, and dozens and dozens of accented
    letters for setting hundreds of languages. So, romanized Russian means that any
    accents needed for setting Russian using the Latin alphabet.\""
