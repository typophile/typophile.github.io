  have a question for our UK representatves, or anyone else who knows who he is!\r\n\r\nIf
  I could set Bob's jokes in a typeface what would it be? I am thinking London Palladiam
  in the 70's. I think his jokes when read, deliver the comedy, I don't want the typeface
  they are set in to be comical, but exude quality stand up. It has to be respectful.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not asking much am I?!\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated as always.\r\n\r\nDoj.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    instantly makes me think of records in charity shops with headings in Bookman
    Swash Italics. I think Bookman Medium gives an air of stand-up in a velvet suit.
    Maybe a carefully placed where he'd be doing the raised eyebrows."
