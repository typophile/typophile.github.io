  is an extended slab serif and a new companion to insigne\u2019s Montag, Dienstag
  and Mittwoch typefaces. Donnerstag conveys power and personality with its strong
  slab letterforms and ball terminals.\r\n\r\nDonnerstag\u2019s seven different weights
  give it a great deal of versatility, from its beefy and masculine black weight to
  the delicate and feminine hairline. Because of Donnerstag\u2019s width, this typeface
  is best used for logotypes, headlines or short blocks of text.\r\nDonnerstag includes
  many useful OpenType features, including a set of upright italic swash alternates,
  ligatures, small caps, fractions and old style figures, alternates for the ball
  terminals and simplified characters for titling. \r\nOpenType-capable applications
  such as the Adobe suite or Quark can take full advantage of automatically replacing
  ligatures and alternates. This family also includes the glyphs to support a wide
  range of latin based languages.\r\n\r\nFor complementary companions, be sure to
  check out the rest of the typeface super family, also available from insigne.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/donnerstag/|20%
