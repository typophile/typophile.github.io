body: greetings all <BR>here is my beginings on a type set im calling form &#43; kaos.  <BR>i
  am a designer/writer &#40;graff&#41; and this is a class project but  <BR>i am very
  interested in creating faces &#40;not just graff&#41; for myself.  <BR> <BR><b>problem
  1:</b> <BR>besides general critique i have the problem of the display  <BR>face
  &#40;kaos&#41; not working together when other words are formed,  <BR>i plan to
  create alternate opening letters as well as closing <BR>letters &#43; accents to
  really capture the whole graff feel. but is  <BR>this possible and how. <BR> <BR><b>problem
  2:</b>  <BR>my teacher said to me, &#39;you&#39;ll never be able to create a text  <BR>face
  from that&#39; and so now i <b>have</b> to create a text face <BR>from that. i tried
  to really tone down the handstyle to make <BR>it work and am looking for suggestions
  to have a readable but <BR>graff style text face. <BR> <BR>thanks&#92; <BR><img

    <BR> <BR>Teachers can be so wonderful, no? <BR>Or maybe it&#39;s the old &#34;humans
    can never be automated&#34; romanticism... As if. <BR> <BR>It was never <i>impossible</i>
    to make &#34;organic&#34; fonts &#40;see Mistral for a masterwork, in metal parallelepipedes
    no less&#41;, just admittedly quite tedious, and generally equally tedious to
    use. But now with the OpenType format some careful table-filling can make for
    quite elegant solutions: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/53553.html"

    <BR>On the other hand, if he/she is using the term &#34;text face&#34; like me,
    as in distinct from display face &#40;pretty unlikely&#41;, then no, it&#39;s
    not possible, but not because of some lack in you or technology, but because of
    the way humans are made. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'Well, I&#39;m not sure what you mean. You can&#39;t create a text face from
    that. Long pages of 10pt text in a blackslanted, loopy style of lettering would
    never work. Text faces are supposed to be invisible. <BR> <BR>But if you meant
    TYPEface, of course you could develop a typeface from this. In fact, I hope you
    do! Just keep in mind two differences: the difference between display sizes and
    text sizes, and the difference between type and lettering. <BR> <BR>Typefaces,
    or more explicitly fonts, are little computer programs, almost machines of their
    own, which can be used by anyone to form any combination of letters, words, lines,
    or pages. Lettering is the creation of individual letters, usually by some sort
    of hand technique. Grafitti is an excellent example of lettering.  <BR> <BR>In
    lettering, it is more common than in type for the individual letters to be different.
    Every time the letter &#34;e&#34; appears in a lettering piece, it is a little
    different than the one before it. In type, this is usually not the case &#40;although
    now it is easier to create alternates and ligatures and such which have the potential
    to make some typefaces more like lettering&#41;. <BR> <BR>What you are showing
    here is a design for a display typeface, based on grafitti-like lettering. <BR>
    <BR>I like the big loops that you have in the B and the R. Would it be possible
    to bring this element into any other letters? maybe numbers? will you be creating
    an upper and lowercase, or just a unicase &#40;as this seems to be now&#41;? <BR>
    <BR>I also like that you are thinking about a type &#34;family&#34; as is evident
    from what you have shown here with the 5 different weights. <BR> <BR>Keep up the
    good work. I&#39;m still confused about the whole &#34;text&#34; thing. Are you
    really saying that you want to create a workable &#34;text&#34; face out of this?
    What kind of applications would you like to see this used in?'

  body: I would like to see this used in coffee table books dealing with <BR>&#39;urban&#39;
    like topics. the two top images would be the display face <BR>and the bottom one
    i want to make it &#39;text face&#39; 12pts and below <BR>and large amounts of
    copy. there will definitly be various weight. <BR>thanks for the quick responses\

  body: Stuart, I don&#39;t want to destroy your enthusiam, but I can&#39;t see how
    this would work for long lengths of texts. Maybe it could work with mad amounts
    of leading... <BR> <BR>You should try to prove all of us wrong, and make it work.
    Post it here, so that we can be astonished &#40;or picky&#41;. <BR> <BR>Dan

    of text, but still have its flavor, upper and lowers? lower x-height?

    coffee table books, you&#39;ll be OK.  :-/ <BR>But if you want people to read,
    and comfortably, you have to give <BR>them what their reading &#34;firmware&#34;
    needs. <BR> <BR>Graffiti might be about freedom, but [text] typography is about
    subtlety. <BR>Which fortunately is not the same thing as slavery to convention;
    but the <BR>realities of the the human reading process &#40;as obtuse and complex
    <BR>as they are&#41; have to be respected. <BR> <BR>To make it work, the first
    thing you need is a lowercase, definitely. <BR>Many typophiles might balk at the
    backslant, but I&#39;m actually not <BR>sure that&#39;s a huge issue. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: "I think you are successful at creating a hand written typeface, yet this
    has no relation to \"graffiti \"style besides the fact that it is closely kerned.
    Don't get me wrong, I enjoy seeing attempts at typefaces from fellow \"writers.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough
    there are no \"real\" rules to graffiti, consistant style shows experience. \r\n\r\nFor
    example:\r\n-M: it seems as if the heavier the wieght, the sloppier it gets.\r\n-B&R:
    they are both consistant with eachother, but not with the other letters\r\n-G&E:
    hits weird angles not found in the other letters\r\n-S: too much white space.
    not a very good rendition of modern graff. Does not follow the condensed feel
    of the other letters.\r\n\r\n...hope this helps."

  body: Wes, no need to apologize. I'd personally like to know why you feel that way.
    Disrespectful in what way. Being that you are someone who is deeply into graffiti
    I would think that others would appreciate understanding as well. It is too easy
    to use a graffiti font and think we have hit the so-called inner-city nail on
    the head, when in fact we might be generalizing in a negative way.

  body: "man I took forever to reply to this. Sorry Tiff\r\n\r\nPizza dude's stuff
    is just not accurate in comparison to the level of graffiti handstyles out on
    the streets. \r\n\r\nThere are certain things that ameture writers (toys) do,
    which is try to complicate their letters too much. They see what is going on around
    them and try to take elements from various artists and mash them together. Of
    course, in the font/lettering world, its obvious that this is not the normal thing
    to do...but graff is not broken down to a science, and this is something you learn
    in the \"field.\" \r\n\r\nJust to give some insight on how deep the styles go,
    graff handstyles used to be regional before the internet came about. Now alphabets
    are being raped and toys copy the \"flavor of the month.\"\r\n\r\nI see many \"graff\"
    (note the quotes) fonts out there that do this same thing, not only the pizza
    ones, but pretty much every other one on the market. There is even a whole site
    dedicated to selling some really <strong>bad</strong> grafffonts.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    check out <a href=\"http://handselecta.com/fonts_hsjoker_li.html>Joker's</a> font
    from Handselecta...a foundry that is doing it the right way. Joker's font is pretty
    true to his handstyle, but taken down a notch so that it will work well as an
    overall font.\r\n\r\n*sorry Kamzo, took this subject in a totally different direction,
    hope that project worked out for you"
