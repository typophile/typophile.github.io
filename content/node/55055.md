  a presentation I gave yesterday.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Handout_6079.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy
  problem is that I don't feel the text 'sits' well on the large A4 page. It's got
  to be on A4 for various reasons, so my question is:\r\n  <em>How could I place this
  text layout more effectively on the page? Are there any guidelines you could give
  for setting text on A4?</em>\r\n\r\n\r\nSebastian"

    between your name and the title. But, I would definitely increase the leading
    between your individual points under each header\u2026right now they look like
    paragraphs without puctuation."

    greater range of point sizes. Also, get rid of the space below the sub-headings.

  body: "HAHA Quincunx, that's exactly what I was after. I feel that it sits a bit
    uneasily on the page.\r\nWhen I first did this, I had the text over to the left
    more and with a column implied by the placement of the name in small caps. I guess
    it was a good idea."

    like 20 mm, see if that's better. :)\r\n\r\nMaybe nudging everything slightly
    up too, but first see what happens once everything is more to the left."
