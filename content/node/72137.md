  for an identity, but I cant find a way to also use it on web (etc typekit, typotheque
  or webfonts on fontshop)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if its still possible?\r\n\r\nOr
  does anyone have suggestions on simular typefaces?\r\n\r\nhttp://vllg.com/system/usage_images/images/379/original/WeddingInvite_3.gif?1261178909\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    not anything quite like it that is. Check the EULA! It allows Sifr embedding."

    people? Edit: Forgive me! It's just the bold weight that is available in OSX and
    Windows.\r\n"

  body: Thanks Frank - not trying to fool anyone. Arial Rounded Bold does not come
    with Windows - but rather with MS Office. So it is not one of the fonts you can
    be assured everyone has. And as you saw it does have a variety of weights in the
    family that make it appealing.

    Netto</a> or the new <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_din_round_web/">FF
