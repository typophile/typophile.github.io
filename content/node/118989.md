  body: "AFAIK this one is not digitized. Gazette Roman is not all that far off as
    a modern substitute. I could nit pick the differences but there is no real point
    as the font is now defunct. But note that the 1867 font is lighter in weight.
    A lighter weight of Gazette Roman or something similar would be helpful.\r\nAs
    for the original, this could be checked against book type in the Boston/Central
    specimen books.\r\nLink to Boston Specimen books http://www.circuitousroot.com/artifice/letters/press/noncomptype/typography/boston/index.html\r\nDon"

  body: "Bob, the lighter weight of Gazette looks closer.\r\nBTW the the samples I
    posted are excellent examples of the emaciated nature of 19th century book types
    that were scrapped at the end of the century.\r\nIn modern fonts we sometimes
    see such lightweight versions as the Latin text component of Far Eastern fonts.
    Might be worth going through them to see if there something that approximates
    the Devine Comedy book, which could perhaps be Boston's \"No.10\" font.\r\nDon"

  body: "Victor, the UC Franklin titling sizes in your Belmont MA bookstore good find
    certainly look like the book titles.\r\nOne of the problems we have is that until
    near the end of the 19th century different font sizes were individually cut and
    there could be quite a lot of variation between font sizes. The Caslons were particularly
    varied in their interpretations.\r\nBut all things considered, I'm leaning towards
    the idea that the 1867 books, Boston \"No10\" and Franklin are pretty much the
    same. Whether by electrotyping or re-cutting I can't say, but Franklin looks really
    similar to Boston \"No10,\" which I believe is probably the font in the books.\r\nSo,
    if we recall elementary logic A=B and B=C means A=C, then some good specimens
    of Franklin should give us the full alphabet for the books.\r\nDon"
