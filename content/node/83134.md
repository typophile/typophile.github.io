  I'm sure many of you have read this book, or maybe have herd of it. If you haven't
  i would strongly recommend it. It discusses a lot of the politics that go into graphic
  design and how we use graphic design in our modern world. My question is, do you
  feel that we as designers have a responsibility when dealing with mainstream advertising
  for products and companies? Do you think that we should have a stronger stand on
  what our skill endorses? Or is graphic communication reached a point of no return,
  and left us in a position where we can no longer pick and choose. \r\n\r\nYour thoughts
  would be great. Thank you.\r\n\r\n-Cortland"
