  body: There was a Franklin Gothic Contour in the old Image Club Letterpress 6.0
    CD. I think that was just like this.

  body: do you have anymore letters, jasonly? I&#39;m not convinced that this one
    is Franklin.... the &#39;R&#39; just doesn&#39;t look Franklinish to me. all the
    Franklins I&#39;ve been able to find have a narrower R with a leg that&#39;s closer
    to vertical. and I don&#39;t think it was expanded optically -- I tried taking
    FG and expanding it and it didn&#39;t look like this.

  body: did that, Marc ... the waist on AG&#39;s R is too low &#40;and besides that,
    the E is wrong&#41;, and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/bold-no-2/testdrive.html?s=RIDE&amp;p=72">this</a>
    is the boldest weight of TG I could find that even resembles the sample, and it&#39;s
    also wrong. <BR> <BR>any other ideas? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Jasonly, could you tell us where the sample was taken from?  I was thinking
    it from RIDE Snowboards, perhaps?

  body: nice work, Patrick! that&#39;s exactly it. <BR> <BR>it seems as though &#39;comstock&#39;
    was a generic term for an inline typeface. does anyone know if this particular
    &#39;Comstock&#39; was based on an existing non-inline sans?

  body: According to Mac McGrew in <i>American Typefaces of the Twentieth Century,</i>
    Comstock originated from the Inland typefoundry in 1902 and was later revived
    by ATF in 1957. It used to be commonly available from sources like VGC and rub-down
    type libraries. <BR> <BR>I think it became obsolete &#40;along with outline styles
    of fonts&#41; because it&#39;s so easy to simulate this style with digital type
    and graphics software. <BR> <BR>I presume the generic term derives from the typeface
    name.
