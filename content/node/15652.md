body: "I have just come across, reading Erik Siekermann's blog, the introduction by
  DB of a new type family. Coming in four versions: Sans (regular, condensed and compressed),
  Head (pretty funny name if you think about it), Serif and News, the family strikes
  me with its overdetailed finishes and its ressemblance both to Bell Gothic and Vesta.
  Anybody knows more about this? Maybe the designer ... \r\n\r\nHere is a link to
  the (german only)PDF introducing the new typeface:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.spiekermann.com/iblog/C61720386/E20051013130639/Media/DBType_Uebersicht.pdf"

    a remark about United Designer's Network being involved in the design of the corporate
    image of DB, including the type family. \r\n\r\nI would really like to know what
    others think of the outcome. "
