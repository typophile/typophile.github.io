  back as you can see.\r\n\r\nI just think that I'm having some typographic problems
  with the back of the buisness card.. what do you think?\r\n\r\n[http://img833.imageshack.us/i/buisnesscardbigliettovi.jpg/\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPierluigi"

  body: "The front is centered and emphatically justified, and the back is neither.\r\n\r\nThe
    use of all caps gives too much emphasis to the relatively unimportant words <em>cell</em>,
    <em>e-mail</em>, and <em>web</em>.\r\n\r\nThe large and uneven space following
    the words <em>cell</em>, <em>e-mail</em>, and <em>web</em> is distracting. I suggest
    a smaller, even space, achieved either by centering all 3 lines or by keeping
    the left alignment but not aligning the telephone number, email address, and URL
    on a tab. Another possibility would be to omit the words <em>cell</em>, <em>e-mail</em>,
    and <em>web</em> entirely, because it's fairly obvious what those things are.\r\n\r\nTo
    my American eyes, the space before and after the dash in the telephone number
    looks too big. Is that the convention for Italian telephone numbers?"

  body: "Why periods after \xABe-mail\xBB and \xABweb\xBB? They're not abbreviations.
    \xABCell\xBB also isn't the sort of abbreviation that I'd put a period after.
    But maybe this is local usage.\r\n\r\nWhy is \xABweb\xBB highlighted? Is it more
    important than the other 2 things?\r\n(Also notice that while it's highlighted
    in terms of color value, in terms of brightness the pink stands out <em>less</em>
    than the white. To my eye \u2013 and depending on how the print is, etc. \u2013
    these 2 variables of hue and brightness/contrast work against each other, which
    may be problematic.)\r\n\r\nSeeing that your URL is [lastname] [firstname], would
    it make sense to have your logo that way round too?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Better. Here's my take on it if you don't mind :) -\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/card-2_5249.png]\r\n<code></code>\r\n\r\n1.
    space lines closer together \r\n2. use smaller font size - just try printing out
    what you have at the moment, it will look ZOOMED IN\r\n3. remove periods after
    CELL/EMAIL/WEB and get rid of all caps\r\n4. use \"email\" instead of \"e-mail\"\r\n5.
    add www. to the web address - I know that it's not needed, but it looks more conventional
    this way\r\n6. add country code to the phone number\r\n7. put it all on a white
    background - there is some reasonably priced black/white duplex stock available\r\n\r\nAlso
    I would strongly suggest to NOT use a Gmail address, or any shared email service
    provider for that matter. Why would I want to email Google when you have your
    own domain?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIf it were my card, I would also drop cell/email/web
    altogether. In fact, I would've also dropped the web address, set the email address
    to <em>me@gigliopierluigi.com</em> and painted <em>gigliopierluigi.com</em> purple.
    Like so:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/card-2-b_6721.png]\r\n<code></code>\r\n\r\nBut
    it's me, I just like it minimalistic :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'd agree on leaving off cell/e-mail/web, unless you've got more than one
    phone number on there I don't see any reason to label any of those.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    on the front side of the card the spacing of \"graphic\" and \"designer\" seems
    a bit awkward to me. I'd probably uniformly align \"brand + graphic designer\"
    under your name.\r\n"
