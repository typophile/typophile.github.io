body: Which font management program do you think is the best?  Meaning one that lets
  you preview fonts within a specific folder, print samples, create custom samples,
  etc?  I&#39;m using Typograf 4.8, and it works pretty good.  Should handle True
  Type, Type 1 and Open Type fonts, too.  Thanks!
