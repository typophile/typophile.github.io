  Dynamics could be indicated by changes in hue or saturation; gradual change would
  represent a crescendo or decrescendo. Accents could be indicated by a sudden change
  on one note. Staccato could have a special color. Phrases even could be grouped
  somehow. You get the point.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I've never seen any sheet music
  printed in color except in books for beginners. Does anyone know of any large works
  of music set in color like this?"

  body: I'd wonder how feasible a solution that would be considering varying degrees
    of color blindness. It'd be much harder to distinguish subtle changes in hue for
    many, even if they could distinguish red from green.

  body: "Humans distinguish pattern much better than they distinguish colour, and
    the higher the contrast the better the pattern recognition. So while using colour
    to notate musical dynamics presents some interesting possibilities it is not very
    practical, especially in terms of sight-reading.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, I went
    and found the scores for some string quartets by Sofia Gubaidulina to which I'd
    been listening. The scores were visually fascinating, but completely baffling
    to me. There was very little in them that I recognised from a fairly basic knowledge
    of typical classical musical notation. Lots of squiggles."

  body: "Stockhausen indeed used colour in some scores. The (notorious) Helikopter-Streichquartett
    score is in four colours; you can take a look at the [[http://www.stockhausen.org/heli_pg_1.html|first
    page]]. There was another score, one of the scenes of Mittwoch aus Licht (Michaelion
    I think, but I might be wrong) which used colour for the dynamics, with gradients
    from one colour to another for crescendo/diminuendo.\r\n\r\nThomas Ades' piano
    piece 'Darknesse Visible' (based on a song by John Dowland) is also printed in
    different colours, with the colours distinguishing different transformations of
    the original material which overlap. (Then there's a nice touch at the end where
    a fragment of the original appears verbatim, extremely quitely, which is printed
    in grey.)\r\n\r\nThose are the only ones which spring to mind just now, but I'm
    sure there are others. I was lately engraving a rather complex new piece (I'm
    a typographer of music rather than text, but so many of the same principles apply)
    for string quartet, each player of the quartet is supposed to switch rapidly between
    two highly contrasting 'musics', as though there were two quartets going on at
    once. In the end we settled on a sort of double-tier of staves (so there would
    be up to eight staves at once), but one of ideas the publisher was originally
    considering was to print that section in two different colours. (Actually, from
    my point of view, that would possibly have been simpler to set...)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well in the olden days it really was engraving (there's at least one publisher
    which still does almost everything that way); the term has just sort of persisted,
    at least among some of the `hardcore'. The other problem is that there's not really
    a better term that is widely understood. `Music typesetting' is clearest I suppose,
    but for some reason I don't like it. `Music origination' is another one I've encountered.
    So, anyway, I call myself a music engraver even though it's not literally true,
    and sounds vaguely pretentious :)\r\n\r\nI use SCORE (a nice old-fashioned DOS
    program) which is what most of the bigger publishers use for serious work, though
    Finale has its advocates too. (Sibelius, though now ubiquitous and undeniably
    feature-laden and user-friendly, is nowhere near good enough.)"

  body: "This reminds me of Faulkner's original intent to publish The Sound and the
    Fury in multiple colors, but ultimately discounted for cost reasons.\r\n\r\nYour
    largest consumers of music (I would think) would be bands and orchestras, who
    purchase large quantities of sheet music at a time.  I know my high school has
    accumulated thousands of pieces of music, which when you consider each ships with
    about 20 different parts or more spanning one to many pages, the addition of color
    would get pricey (above all in the academic environment).\r\n\r\nAlso, I know
    a lot of musicians who like to highlight and use different colors for different
    things which can then be done in the color the musician wants.  And speaking as
    someone who played euphonium, trombone, and tuba, once I learnt music, for concert
    performances I mainly only looked at the notes themselves.  Once you've practiced
    a piece enough you know what dynamics and stylings you need and where, and half
    the time the notes themselves are only reminders. Of course, most marching bands
    perform with no music at all (I did see one or two bands during my time in the
    Million Dollar Band using lyres, but they weren't Div IA schools and without the
    large music programs at larger universities). Remember, dynamics and other such
    markings are generally suggestions that may be ignored, extended, or otherwise
    modified depending on the needs of the group or the views of the conductor.\r\n\r\nIn
    other words, I would think it would be more expensive without much benefit, at
    least for traditional music.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina

  body: "If I remember correctly, the coloured lines on the Helicopter Quartet score
    are added to indicate the passing of the different lines of music between the
    players. I don\u2019t believe that they are necessary for its realisation, apart
    from helping unpick the most complex bits of a texture.\r\n\r\nAnother composer
    who I think used colour in his scores was Harry Partch as a method of fitting
    his 43-tone scale into conventional Western notation.\r\n\r\nWestern notation
    is, undoubtedly, being forced in directions where it is not suited. Some of Brian
    Ferneyhough\u2019s [[http://users.unimi.it/~gpiana/dm7/lanza/image102.gif|scores]]
    particularly come to mind in terms of pure complexity. There are also some philosophical
    problems are occasionally aired. For instance, Western notation lends itself to
    notation pitch and rhythm with a high degree of precision, whilst dynamics and
    articulation are only roughly suggested. However, I think that notational reform
    suffers from the same problems as suggested reforms to the alphabet; once people
    have learnt how to read, it is much easier to struggle through complex scores
    than to start again. Even relatively helpful innovations, such as Schoenberg\u2019s
    signs for indicating the dominant and secondary lines have not caught on.\r\n\r\ningemisco,
    if you have used it, how does SCORE compare to [[http://lilypond.org/web/index|Lilypond]]?
    It\u2019s not an application which I have come across before. Playing off Sibelius\u2019ed
    parts is never a good experience...it\u2019s a bit like reading a novel set by
    the default settings of Microsoft Word."

  body: "this idea has been explored several times in history. scriabin and goethe,
    in addition to stockhausen, are among the better known names to have attempted
    to codify music and color. there have been several systems devised, and copious
    information is available thru google searches on iterations of the topic. \r\n
    \r\nit seems more work has been done on color and visual information linked to
    audible music as an output process rather than as an input code. it would be interesting
    to reverse engineer an output model to create a usable input code and/or instrument.\r\n\r\none
    of the immediate problems with correlating the visible spectrum to musical pitch
    is that (while both are vibrational and thus reducable to numerics) in colored
