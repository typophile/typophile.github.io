  liberal in terms of allowing web use of their fonts. Anything from SiFR and Cufon
  and up to @font-face was permitted. And now I can't find that thread. Nor can I
  find any traces of any web/online usage permissions on Adobe's website. Their Font
  FAQ page is 404 too. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone has any experience with this? I am looking
  to use ITC Franklin Gothic on a page for the body text. Would hate to pre-render
  it :-|\r\n\r\nThanks"

    there are/were different rules with Adobe Originals vs the Monotype, ITC and Linotype
    fonts they resell. I would go direct to Monotype for a web font version of ITC
    Franklin Gothic, or a better Franklin on webtype.com http://www.webtype.com/store/search/?q=franklin\r\n"

  body: 'Thanks Ken, that''s a useful link. The sifr/cufon section implies that Adobe
    owned fonts can be embedded in Flash apps. Do you have a pointer where Flash embedding
    is called out as approved?  '

  body: "Yep, that's the one. Thanks, Sii.\r\n\r\nReading Monotype EULA -\r\n\r\n<cite>12.
    You may electronically distribute Font Software embedded in a \"Personal or Internal
    Business Use\" document (that is, a document other than a \"Commercial Product\"
    as defined herein) only when the Font Software embedded in such document (i) is
    in a static graphic image (for example, a \"gif\") or an embedded electronic document,
    and (ii) is distributed in a secure <strong>format that permits only the viewing
    and printing</strong> (and not the editing, altering, enhancing, or modifying)
    of such static graphic image or embedded document.</cite>\r\n\r\nTechnically the
    HTML page with @font-face embedding falls under (ii) as it does not really permit
    \"editing, altering, enhancing, or modifying\". Sure one can save the page and
    then edit it as a text file, but exactly the same applies to PDFs and Flash applets,
    the use of both of which appear to be allowed.\r\n\r\nThe Webtype selection seems
    odd - there's light and medium, but no regular weights. It is also a <em>service</em>.
    The same goes for Monotype's, though they do have a better selection including
    Trade Gothic Next and News Gothic in all weights and styles.\r\n"

    if a font owned by Adobe or not? For example, is <a href=http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=NEWG10005000>this
    one</a> \"Adobe owned\"?"

  body: "Oh, I understand it's a stretch :) However the meaning of \"secure\" varies
    depending on whom one asks, so the only unambiguous way to read (ii) is to take
    it as an actual <em>definition</em> of \"secure\". If something does not permit
    \"editing, altering, enhancing, or modifying\" of the document, then it is \"secure\".
    And HTML is \"secure\" under that definition.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm guessing you meant
    to link to http://www.adobe.com/type/embedding.html, which basically says \"open
    the font file and look at the foundry info\". Hardly practical."

  body: "Good news, Sii: the lawyers have <a href=\"http://books.google.com/googlebooks/legal.html\">worked
    it out</a>!\r\n\r\nI was looking at the Google Books In-Browser Reader yesterday
    which has select/copy/paste and save disabled and, in general, uses every obfuscation
    trick in the book.\r\nIt would be difficult not to deem it \"secure\". I think
    it clearly falls under that license.\r\nI'm just surprised the license doesn't
    out and out forbid @font-face because @font-face is linking, not embedding, even
    though Microsoft keeps calling it embedding but as you've told me, it's actually
    distribution.\r\n\r\n"
