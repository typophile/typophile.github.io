  body: "That's it Bob! The rubber stamps Harold Lohner used for Artistamp Medium
    \r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/similar?KHJ\r\nlook like they were based on a condensed
    version of the circa 1900 De Vinne design, with the R and Q edited to be less
    floppy. \r\nFor a digital variation of condensed De Vinne with smooth letters
    see Hawthorne:\r\n http://www.identifont.com/similar?6EF \r\nA regular width version
    of DeVinne was recently digitized by Jeff Levine as Publication:  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/publication/\r\nAlso
    De Vinne from wooden type fonts:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/de-vinne/\r\nFor
    a rubber stamp treatment of the wider width of De Vinne see Harold Lohner's Hand
    Stamped JNL:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/hand-stamped/\r\nThe De
    \ Vinne typeface has been discussed many times before at typophile, most recently

  body: "Thanks Stephen, for the comment on the DeVinne alternate straight R leg in
    ATF 1923. I own a copy of the book and on checking, I found that you are indeed
    correct. Never noticed before. As Stan says in South Park, I learned something
    today.\r\nDon"
