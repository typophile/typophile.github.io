  yet. I would like to know how to use the % symbol properly in my technical writing.\r\n\r\nie.
  The motor speed is set in the range of 0 to 100%.\r\n\r\nIs there to be a percent
  sign after the 0 as well? Do I just spell out the word percent at the end? HELP!! "

    sound stuffy.\r\n\r\nYou could also go with 0-100% (with an en dash where I used
    a hyphen)."

    <em>Percentages.</em> Percentages are always given in numerals. In humanistic
    copy the word <em>percent</em> is used; in scientific and statistical copy, or
    in humanistic copy that includes numerous percentage figures, the symbol % is
    more appropriate.\r\n<em>\r\nOnly 45 percent of the electorate voted.\r\nWith
