  body: "Thanks! \r\nIt's exactly that font. But I don't really remember the name
    of it :) Might be I saw some similar then. But it's very nice font.\r\nThe publication
    is \"Friday\" magazine by Gulf News newspaper in UAE. It's very nice magazine.
    One of the best here in Dubai. I'm talking about design :)\r\nThey are using Jubilant
    in printed magazine. I think before they used some other font. But Jubilant looks
    great!\r\nWebsite is this I think: http://gulfnews.com/about-gulf-news/al-nisr-portfolio/friday"
