body: "The Muna typestyle is everywhere in the Arab countries. It is not difficult
  to find an example of its usage anywhere you happen to be in these countries. Ranging
  from its usage on huge commercial advertisements, Arab Spring protest banners, shop
  signs, to small tickets, the Muna font is usually the designer's or typesetter's
  preference.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/needchange300_5823.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  main reasons for the popularity of the Muna font is the conformity of the font's
  characters with the traditional letter forms. This conformity however did not prevent
  its designer, [[http://www.abdulla.faris.com/|Abdullah Faris]], from developing
  a fresh and contemporary style design. These two reasons, in addition to some beautiful
  and ingenuous details used in the design, helped to promote the popularity of this
  font. The popularity of Al-Nashir Al-Sahafy publishing platform, for which the Muna
  font was designe, is also an important factor that contributed to the widespread
  usage of this font.\r\n\r\nThese issues and more, are discussed in my [[http://arabictype.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/muna-abdallah-faris/|latest
  blog entry on this successful font]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/munavsyaqout600_4062.jpg]\r\n\r\n"
