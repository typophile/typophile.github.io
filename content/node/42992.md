  one be able to have two anchors of the same class in one glyph?  One being designated
  the mark anchor and the other the base glyph anchor? \r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is
  that I'd like to specify how different accents build on one another, but at the
  moment with my font I get odd mixed results on being able to place two+ accents.
  \ Either they pile up as if the other weren't there, or they stack up ignoring the
  anchors that I had placed, or they stack properly but the base glyph disappears.
  (this last one sounds like a bug in the Cocoa text engine).\r\n\r\nHowever, fontforge
  doesn't seem to like the ida of two anchors, one to position an accent, and another
  to position any accents that would be piled on it.  Am I going about this the wrong
  way?"

    points and classes</strong></a>: to put a diacritic on top of another, you use
    an <code><strong>mkmk</strong></code> tag. If you browse the GPOS mkmk lookups
    of the <a href=\"http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\"><strong>Dejavu</strong></a>sans
    font, you'll see nicely stacked diacritics.\r\n\r\n"
