<p>update: swashes?&hellip;</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/norcal_201_6058.jpg]</p>
<p>I am creating a new logo for my company, Norcal designs (<a href="http://www.norcaldesigns.com">www.norcaldesigns.com</a>), and decided to post my work from concept to finish up here for helpful advice and critiques. NorCal Designs is a graphic design company and I create any kind of corporate collateral (business cards, letter heads, company logo work, etc.) but I specialize in website design &amp; creation for small businesses.</p>
<p>This is the first piece of concept work for my new logo based on Emigre&rsquo;s Sabbath Black. I am not sure on the look and feel that I want to achieve yet so hopefully it will develop along the way.</p>
<p>Below is my sketched out version of the lettering as well as the traced paths in illustrator (which took forever) and the result. At the very bottom is Emigre&rsquo;s Sabbath Black to show you my starting point.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/norcal_process copy_6534.jpg]</p>
<p>I am looking for ideas on where to take this, interesting blackletter variations I can try adding, any ideas on improvement. It is very unfinished both in the concept and lettering. for now&hellip;</p>

<p>If you stand back and look at the logo, the eye cannot decipher that portion of the design (because the lines are too fine). Your client definitely wants the name to be fully legible. The &ldquo;D&rdquo; has a disproportionate amount of (what will visually translate as) white space in comparison to the other characters; so when you stand back, it appears as though there is a gap in the text.</p>

overall pretty nice, a few things. the counter of the D looks so large and, um, empty. not very blackletterish. the s&rsquo;s jumped out at me as being MUCH too wide. the counter of the g feels too small and the tail perhaps too large. the &ldquo;feet&rdquo; on i and l could be a bit more discreet. the e looks top-heavy and seems to be attacking the letter to the right.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks for the critique!! Below is the updated version of the logotype (based on your suggestions):</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/norcal_logotype_300_4045.jpg]</p>
<p>NorCal is a term used a lot in my area, i don&rsquo;t think the N or C will get passed too many people. Also the term norcal became popular along with a clothing brand with the word norcal set in blackletter along with a star.</p>
<p>Also I like blackletter more than i am afraid of the motorcycle stigma attached to it. I am not specifically looking for a &ldquo;blackletter&rdquo; feel. I simply like the letterforms.</p>
<p>I am trying to come up with some treatment for the type to get rid of the motorcycle feel. Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

<p>That &ldquo;D&rdquo; is looking more legible, except the spine that was added looks like it is getting steam-rolled into the curls. See how it slants at about a 70 degree angle? I would straighten that out a bit. Also lessening the lower-left curl on the &ldquo;D&rdquo;. That curl is disproportionately large compared to every other curl in the design&hellip;and it is creating alot of white space.  That will help to tighten up the logo into a more unified image.</p>

<p>It just seems annoying to me the continued association of stigmas to blackletter. There is the whole other thread about negative associations due to nazi use (even though Hitler banned its ussage). So now I am looking for ways to make it more friendly and give off a design-ery feel.</p>

<p>While the Nazi association might be a stigma, I&rsquo;m not sure the rest are. It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s a rather stylized letterform, so the association is a bit stronger with some very specfic uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>religion</li>
<li>news papers</li>
<li>germany</li>
<li>tattoos</li>
<li>gangs</li>
<li>motorcycles</li>

But i think Blackletter in general is only a &ldquo;stylized&rdquo; letterform because of it&rsquo;s lack of use, and then only abundantly for the associations that you mentioned. I am looking for ways to make it more versatile. To create a look that does not associate with any of these groups. (of course the type by itself isn&rsquo;t my attempt, it is just my starting point).</p>
<p>@vintagesignman. Lol i will tighten that gap. But i also really want to have to use a Pi ligature now! Cool logo, but this is sort of the look i want to get away from. Are you showing it for the swashes?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks! in my own defense i have never had a client lead from my website or business card. So I am not making a logo to acquire new clients, I am making it solely to please myself and expand my abilities.</p>
<p>With that said I do not think I will ever be satisfied with my own identity. But any suggestions for improving on this one would be welcome. Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I second that.
I found it hard to do a identity for myself, but it was an interesting way.</p>
<p>About your lettering.</p>
<p>I use so now and then the blackletter.
Living in the Netherlands it brings an association with the second World War.
But these letterforms have it in them to break out of that jacket, but it takes time.</p>
<p>You showed us your work soley in black (beside the blue above), try other colors. Lets say lime or orange. You will lose the biker association quickly, I think. I&rsquo;d like to see that.</p>
<p>Nice study!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Black letter + norcal = already done. You should know this if your into action sports and its kinda cheesy for some&hellip;especially me:(</p>
<p>Your logo reminds me of the nautical stars, flat bill Starter® hats, and black socks valley kids wear. If you are targeting them go for this letting but caution cause to me its says motorcross tatoo kid who started his own design company.</p>
<p>I like your previous branding on your website much more. Please dont take my critique as disrespect. Others above seem to agree.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve admired your designs and respected your perspective that you have shared in these forms j_polo9 (do you mind if I call you Jesse?).  Having said that, I echo mad grab&rsquo;s opinion that norcal + blackletter is tired and not incredibly creative.  I don&rsquo;t think this design is poorly executed, and your hard work shows.  I just think you can do better.</p>
