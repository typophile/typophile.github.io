body: "I have been reading a lot about Martin Majoor's typefaces lately. He wasn't
  happy with how  [[http://martinmajoor.com/1_scala.html|Scala]] was being used so
  he designed [[http://martinmajoor.com/3_seria.html|Seria]] as his \u201Cliterary\u201D
  typeface. This was also in response to a request to make a second italic for Scala.
  He realized this wouldn't be possible with Scala so he designed Seria.\r\n\r\nFrom
  what I can tell Seria is Scala with longer ascenders and descenders as well as an
  italic that isn't as sloped. I'm sure there is probably much more to it than that
  though. By making the ascenders and descenders longer he was able to make the second
  italic. The second italic was never publicly released.\r\n\r\nI have read everything
  I can find but I can't figure out what other characteristics make Seria a \u201Cliterary\u201D
  typeface. I am also wondering what situations Scala would be inadequate for? The
  information I've been reading is from [[http://martinmajoor.com/index.html|Martin
  Majoor's site]]. He has a lot of links to information about his typefaces."
