  Dates: November 15, 2012 through January 6, 2013\r\nDeadline to Submit Portfolio:
  June 25, 2012\r\n\r\nTypography and design are so much more than the structural
  background behind words. With the advent of digital technology, letterforms have
  become an artistic medium in their own right. The ability to manipulate even the
  smallest parts of the letter has given us the freedom to use typography in nonlinear
  ways. From traditional type on paper and book to kinetic typography using digital
  media, this exhibit showcases the complex design instrument of our language on the
  printed page and beyond. The curators seek a broad variety of artwork in all media
  (including video) that explores the intersection between art and typography.\r\n\r\nIn
  general, artworks should not exceed 60\u201D in any dimension, although exceptions
  may be made. There is much more space for two-dimensional artwork than there is
  for three- dimensional artwork in the galleries.\r\nSales\r\n\r\nTo submit portfolios
  electronically, email digital images or URLs with work samples to Director of Exhibitions
  Matthew Leslie at matt@themuck.org. For other questions, please contact Director
  of Exhibitions Matthew Leslie at +1 714-738-6706, or email him at matt@themuck.org."
