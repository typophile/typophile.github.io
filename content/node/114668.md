  body: "I agree with Ryuk. You did not mention the source of the A. If it's from
    a sports uniform, jacket, cap etc. you could find the rest of the alphabet at
    a company that sells such letters, e.g. http://www.richardsoncap.com/decoration/stock-team-letters
    or http://www.uesports.com/cap-embroidery-detail.php?pdid=281&pdtype=&parnode=&relNode[0]=

    Oakland Athletic's]] identity.
