  body: "I managed to read Fiona and Simon after a few seconds which is a good start,
    but I think it could be clearer. For me, it's the F that causes the problems.
    I think the top bar of the F needs to be closer to the vertical bar to help visually
    join the two. I've attached a couple of suggestions of what I mean and how I would
    improve it. Apologies in advance for the very crude butchery method i've employed
    to illustrate my ideas!\r\n\r\nHope this helps?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FS_ambigram_6166.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FS_ambigram_1_5669.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FS_ambigram_2_6606.jpg]"

  body: "Looks nice. I didn't have trouble reading the names, nor did I have any trouble
    with the F.\r\n\r\nIt might be cool to experiment with what the S might look like
    if it also read as an ampersand when it was flipped. Right now, it just appears
    to be an extra stroke after Fiona."

  body: "Firstly, Hi! That is a good ambigram design, and I've seen some good ones.
    The choice of type - soft and smooth - is spot on for a momentous event. \r\n\r\nI
    am agreeing with WhitePepper about the F. The 'im' could be tweaked to a different
    form of 'a'. Below is an example (tried to show only the 'im' solution but got
    caught up with the design itself, pardon me. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fiona&simon_6144.jpg]\r\n\r\nnagfa"
