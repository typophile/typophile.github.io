body: I just want to send a thank you shout out to this forum. I had been trying to
  install FontExplorer X onto my new MacBook Pro (Leopard) and having odd permissions
  problems. I emailed Linotype with no reply. Then I did a search for FontExplorer
  and Leopard on typophile and found threads saying there had been a compatibility
  problem and that Linotype had issued an upgrade. I downloaded the new version and
  it works just fine. If not for this forum I'd be stewing (literally, it's going
  up to 100 degrees here today) and frustrated and possibly purchasing another font
  software out of desperation.

    a paying customer? I know that among the typophile regulars, there are a few representatives
    of competitive firms, and they will be a-shakin' their heads and saying, \"Not
    with us!\"\r\n\r\nHopefully. I also hope that those 100 degrees is not in centigrades."

  body: "It's farenheit. I just did something I never do - let a client make a decision
    for me rather than schlep over to their offices in this heat. But a girl has to
    have priorities.\r\n\r\nChris - yes, I have received myriad InDesign tips from
    Linda and Tiffany among others. It was just so nice to be able to solve my problem
    so easily thru this forum.\r\n\r\nRe Linotype - to be fair I sent the email over
    the weekend and they might be replying today or the next, but I was too impatient.
    I'm very eager to get the laptop functional so I can travel with it. It's so yummy.
    I got the lunchtray (17\") with the high res screen and the first one they sent
    me was a lemon - flickery screen. This replacement machine seems fine but wow
    no dialup modem port. At my beach house that is actually how we get online. No
    cars neither but we do have indoor plumbing."

    :-)\r\n\r\nNah, not really. Up at the place in far western Ontario we still have
    to step out to \"the little house behind the house.\" Not a problem.\r\n\r\n&
    we don't even have a phone line up there, so the lunchtray laptop gets to stay
    home for a week or more. Swim & fish & read & walk. No typography. I can't wait
    until August.\r\n\r\npowers"
