  looking for a font with the properties:\r\n- very legible\r\n- heavy width\r\n-
  square/rectangular shaped letters\r\n- both square and rounded corners\r\n- available
  in oblique/italic\r\n\r\nA few fonts that come close are:\r\n- [[http://www.t26.com/fonts/Megahertz]]
  (too wide)\r\n- [[http://www.t26.com/fonts/YR72]] (not legible enough)\r\n- [[http://www.t26.com/fonts/Reaction]]
  (very close!)\r\n\r\nThe character I'm looking for is modern, sports channel, skateboarding,
  etc.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any thoughts or tips I'd very much appreciate your suggestions!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't know, but from the examples, it seems the original poster means a
    relatively square and monoline sans serif.\r\n\r\nOf course, we type geeks use
    the word \"slab\" exclusively to mean a style of serif, so \"slab sans\" seems
    like a bit of an oxymoron.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT "

    my poor technical syntax well! Thank you for finding the appropriate declarations.\r\n\r\nI
    am looking for a relatively square and monoline sans serif. \"Armchair Modern\"
    is a good suggestion (thank you!), as it seems to be a stylized take on Eurostyle.
    \"Armchair Modern D Guage\" is about the right weight... if only it were available
    in oblique.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I can be more specific by saying that I am looking
    for a font that is a more stylized/squared version of \"Eurostyle Black Oblique.\"\r\n\r\nThank
    you for your help and suggestions."

    (snark!) how about <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/suitcase/purista_bold_italic/">Purista
    Bold Italic</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/suitcase/magion_italic/">Magion
    Italic</a>? Maybe not wide enough.

  body: "Ooh. Purista Bold Italic is close (I'll have to overlook your snarkiness
    for that suggestion!).\r\n\r\nMy only concern with Purista is that the lower case
    \"a\" is single-storey (see, I'll get the terminology correct eventually). I know
    it may seem like I'm obsessing, but the logo will be applied to roadside signage.
    Since the name includes the letters \"oa\" I need a lot of contrast between those
    shapes.\r\n\r\nI figure if there is any community wherein an obsession over finding
    the right typeface will be tolerated, it must be this one!"
