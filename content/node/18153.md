body: "Hey all\r\n\r\nHere is a logo I designed for my firm and I wanted to get some
  feed back from everyone here.  Now before you all say it; Yes, I know that the scales
  of justice is one of the most overused legal images but my first name is Troy and
  I like that the scales evoke the image of an uppercase T.  \r\n\r\nI wanted a logo
  that was fairly coservative but with a contemporary feel.  I would be open to adding
  some color for a little punch, but nothing excessive.  I also wanted a logo that
  even from a distance would let you know that it belonged to a law firm.  I have
  seen a lot of really visually appealing law firm logos that didn't give you any
  indication of whether the company was a law firm or a theme park.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for all of your help in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(I could not get the image to load
  on the page, if anyone knows how I can do this please let me know.)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hough

  body: Troy, please don't take offense to this, but I would think that if you're
    practicing law, you can afford to hire a graphic designer to design a proper logo
    for you. I will say that the logo is not "bad" per se. You've done a decent enough
    job, but it certainly does not look any different than hundreds of other law firm
    logos out there. Good luck.

  body: I feel like you could benifit from somthing even more traditional, maybe with
    reference to the standard law office letterhead http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/tac/notices/299a.gif
    . As a law office, I don't think you would benefit from a logo that would would
    be "clever" in any sense.  Maybe use the T and reference the scales rather that
    using the scales to reference the T, that way you remove "overused legel image"
    issue.  Just some first thoughts

  body: Its not conserative enough for me. It doesn't inspire confidence, it looks
    industrial. Loose the cliche scales and use your full name and title(s). Pick
    a high quality letterhead paper and think of a process you might print the frims
    name like hot stamping or blind embossing. Go upscale not ambulance chaser.

  body: "The scales are definitely overused although I do understand how the \"t\"
    plays in. Visually the HOUGH treatment doesn't make sense. There's no logic to
    what you're doing with the logo to portray the difference you plan to offer your
    market.\r\n\r\nIt does look really industrial. It looks a bit amateurish which
    would make sense seeing as you're not a professional designer. If you must cut
    costs, i would say at least go to a design college and recruit a student looking
    to build their portfolio and throw them some money.\r\n\r\nIt's a good try, but
    there is a reason why our occupation exists.\r\n\r\nJoseph Szala\r\nVigor Graphic

  body: "I certainly do not plan to outright bag your design, though I do feel a need
    to support the above statements. Joseph is absolutely correct when he states <em>there
    is a reason why our occupation exists</em>; as there is a valuable reason why
    your occupation exists.\r\n\r\nAt this time I do not feel that your logo sets
    you out from your competition in a positive manner, nor do I get a feeling of
    confidence, security, professionalism or excellence in your field, which as an
    audience member I would hope to get. I also do not feel that currently your logo
    depicts a contemporary enough message, rather something dated or staid.\r\n\r\nI
    apologise that these criticisms are so negative; however I would like to offer
    a suggestion that perhaps another way to keep costs down would be to find a smaller
    design firm or freelance graphic designer who may benefit from a trade of services
    for something like contract writing advice or professional services; or indeed
    a young graphic design student who would benefit from an appropriate remuneration
    agreement.\r\n\r\nBest.\r\n-nic\r\n"

  body: "Well, it looks like every other legal related logo on the planet. Now, that
    isn't necessarily bad. The scales have become the universal symbol for 'lawyer'
    so if you are looking for people that need a lawyer that are just walking down
    the street, then hanging that sign probably makes sense.\r\n\r\nHowever, for business
    correspondence, I don't think you need the symbol to point out the fact that you
    are a lawyer. As such, i'd ditch the scales altogether as it does nothing to make
    you unique in this field."

  body: I looks too clip art.  It reminds me of a logo done in microsoft word sort
    of.  There are ways evoking a strong, trustworthy image without being so literal.
    I agree with ditching the iconography.  There are plenty of typefaces out there
    that portray what you are trying to say all by themselves.  Try type only.  I
    like the idea of going to a college and hiring a student if you are trying to
    cut costs.

  body: "I like it much more without the scales.\r\n\r\nAlso, the open outside edges
    of the H's make me uneasy. A thin black line on either side to contain the letters
    and to maintain sharp vertical lines might enhance its stability."
