  body: "What makes you think it's a font? It is most likely designed by itself, like
    a logo or the other pictures. It would also vary from one slot machine manufacturer
    to another.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that somebody has since put one of these into
    a font imitating the original design, but I haven't seen it.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    wait until morning the gurus can probably point you toward something similar.
    In the meantime you could check out Letterhead fonts -- www.letterheadfonts.com
    -- they have some great western styles.\r\n\r\nThread closed --> http://typophile.com/node/20791"
