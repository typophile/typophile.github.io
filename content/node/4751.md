body: Hi does anyone know of any good tutorials on creating logos or lettering with
  &#39;swashes&#39; similar to some Baseball badges, or even the Coke logo at a push.
  Really I&#39;m after a more rounded look but anything to get me on the road to understanding
  how to hand draw them. Cheers, stay frosty.

  body: d, I don&#39;t know where you are from but look to find either a Calligraphy
    site or a Calligraphy teacher. It will go a long way for you to understand how
    swashes evolved.
