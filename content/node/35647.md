  central feature is the typeface gallery- renovation was long overdue. Other highlights
  include background on the designers, a \"new releases\" news subscription option,
  and links to the projects we support.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nNext up, I finishing the shop.
  I plan to offer a few things I haven't seen anyone else do with digital type yet.
  Then, I will expand the specimens a bit.\r\n"

    who had the time to put together such an incredible pastiche. It's like Ninja
    Burger, or the Yes Men, or Spinal Tap in the thoroughness of execution. I love
    all of the links to other pastiche sites, and the goth \"calligrapher\", and the
    custom type projects. (A logo for a local band. Brilliant.)\r\n\r\nI'm curious
    to know what the end game is for this project. Bravo!\r\n\r\nJN"

    -- I like some of the faces!\r\nWell, you do things differently, and I admire
    the breadth of your have-a-go-ness, such as Typosium and the Snark.\r\nMore fonts,
    shop, and type tester. But so much work to do.\r\nGood luck with it."

  body: 'Thank you, Nick. More fonts are coming, and that is what matters most. Yes,
    the site is in deep need of a type-tester, but I haven''t determined the best
    approach to implementing that. Fortunately things are very modular. My interim
    device is a series of thumbnails for each face, hopefully online by next week. '
