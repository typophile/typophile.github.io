  1878-1935.\r\n\r\nJakob Erbar was trained as a type compositor in D\xFCsseldorf
  and took courses in type and lettering with Fritz Helmut Ehmcke and Anna Simons.
  He worked as a job typesetter for the Dumont-Schauberg printing works in Cologne.
  \r\n\r\nIn 1908 he began teaching at the St\xE4dtische Berufsschule, and from 1919\u201335
  taught at the [[K\xF6lner Werkschule]].\r\n\r\nHe is best known for the Erbar typeface,
  but designed severeal others. Erbar began working on a sans serif design in 1914,
  but was interrupted by the war. In 1919 Feder Schrift or Feder Grotesk, a stressed
  style sans serif, appeared.  \r\n\r\nIn 1922 Erbar had made drawings for another
  sans serif design and in 1926 the Erbar typeface appeared. It appears in supplement
  to \u201CHandbuch der Schriftarten\u201D. Erbar did have an alternate lowercase
  with a lower x-height, but this was not in the export version which reached America.
  An inline and bold version of the type called Phosper or Grotesk Lichte appeared
  in 1923. The Lumina and Lux faces were also variants based on Erbar.\r\n\r\nCreated
  a number of typefaces for Frankfurt typefounders [[Ludwig and Mayer]].\r\n\r\n<em>Fonts
  Designed:</em>\r\n[[Feder Grotesk]] (1910)\r\n[[Erbar]]\r\n[[Lucina]], [[Lumina]],
  [[Lux]], [[Phosphor]] (1922-1930)\r\n[[Koloss]] (1923)\r\n[[Candida]] (1936)\r\n"
