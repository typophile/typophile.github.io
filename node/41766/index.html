<p>That’s all irrelevant to type designers not wanting to create the glyphs in Illustrator and then move them into Fontlab, as doing so can be a PITA. It could be great for lettering artists, or designers who can letter but have limited time budgets and can’t take the time to clean up their own work for publication.</p>
<p>But it’s still irrelevant to the 50%+ of designers who don’t work on Windows.</p>

It would be even better though, if it was in Fontlab than in Illustrator.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The main problem seems to me that once you have made the step from calligraphic drawing to contours you cannot go back.</p>
<p>This means that you either have to develop the whole typeface with the calligraphy tool, which would be difficult if you cannot actually typeset (does Live Pen export fonts?).
Or, you would make the step to contours at some point but then you loose the advantage of making calligraphic adjustments unless you go back again, convert again and so on.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should have a tool that controls stroke weight and transitions according to a calligraphic logic but is implemented on the basis of outlines in the first place (and in FL, of course). That would allow you to work in both &lsquo;modes&rsquo; at the same time.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>I could not find any setting that allows to draw with a broad-nib pen.</p>

<p>Also, there is no setting that controls the transition between thin and thick, it is always linear.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In that sense, it is far inferior to Kalliculator. None of the Noordzijan logic implemented.</p>
<p>Of course, you can do all this by making up the letter with lots of individually adjusted nodes but then that is not quicker than drawing the contours straight away.</p>
<p>As I said, that was just a quick test, maybe I missed something.</p>

<p>Because the people who create them usually don’t even understand how most type designers work. So something really brilliant like LivePen comes out as a Windows-only Illustrator plugin. But at least FontLab was able to buy it, and hopefully it will turn up in a future version of FontLab sometime around 2025.</p>
