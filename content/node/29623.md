  the latest <a href=\"http://mysite.verizon.net/evzine/\">Electric Velocipede</a>
  (f/sf 'zine, $US4/issue) which packs more typography-related puns into one page
  than I think I've heard in my life. Although I wonder how long it'll take Typophile.com
  to top it...\r\n<cite>\r\nIn popped the maid, Tilde. \"Your case may be more acute
  than that, my poor darling. Many is the night I've seen you kerning on the porch
  with young Virgule. Law, last night I thought the angle brackets would give way.\"
  (<a href=\"http://mysite.verizon.net/evzine/htm/fiction.htm#fiction07\">more...</a>)\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\n(I'm
  not involved with <em>EV</em>. I also don't hang out here nearly often enough, but
  I thought you lot would appreciate the headsup.)\r\n\r\nEdit: there's a <a href=\"http://mysite.verizon.net/evzine/htm/fiction.htm#fiction07\">different
  excerpt</a> on the <em>EV</em> site. I kept mine short because the whole thing is
  only a page long, after all, so between the two there's still some of the story
  you haven't seen."

  body: I love puns. In fact, I've just sent a big project off that requires a lot
    of handwork. Since several hundred thousand of them will be produced, the project
    is being done in China. So I told my coworkers that for the Chinese, it is about
    to be fold and glue season.
