  see that here is lots and lots of highly professional typographers and graphic designers
  around.\r\n\r\nSo I'm redesigning a magazine and decided to use Parisiene as a secondary
  display and body text typeface. I will allso use Porchez's Ambroise sparingly here
  and there.\r\n\r\nBut i have struggled for a while with the primary bodytext typeface
  that would work in display size allso.\r\n\r\nMagazine has short an long stories
  and topics vary from fashion to world politics and photo reportages. So i need very
  flexible typefaces in terms of use in stories with very different contents.\r\n\r\nI
  would like the magazine's typography to have a elegant, reliable and modern up to
  date sound to it.\r\n\r\nI know this is quite hard one, but I wouldn't have turned
  to you if it wasn't.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    has all that i want, but its bit too stiff for my taste. Le But Le Monde Livre
    is very close to what I'm looking for. \r\n\r\nAny other suggestions? Anyone?"
