body: "I uploaded two documents about Ionic fonts, i.e. about \"Ionic No. 5\" and
  all the other similar fonts such as Aurora, Corona, Opticon, Paragon, Imperial,
  Textype, Excelsior, Clarion, Nimrod etc. etc.\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/ionic2.pdf\r\n\r\nsee
  http://www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/ionic.pdf\r\n\r\nI wrote that Opticon and Paragon
  have not yet been digitized. Is this correct?\r\n\r\nI know that nowadays the names
  of \"Opticon\" and \"Paragon\" are used for two completely different fonts:\r\n\r\nsee
  http://www.dafont.com/opticon-one.font\r\n\r\nsee http://www.fontcenter.de/P-PARAGONN.TTF-Paragon.html\r\n\r\nTherefore,
  it could be possible that the original Ionic fonts \"Opticon\" and \"Paragon\" were
  digitized under new names.\r\n\r\nI temporarily uploaded a scan from an old catalog
  showing these fonts:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/opticon-paragon.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  clues about digital versions of Opticon and Paragon?"

    though.\r\n\r\nThe pdfs are very interesting. It's almost better that I can't
    read German, because it makes you actually look at the text.\r\n\r\nThanks Uli!"
