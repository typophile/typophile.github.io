<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
I see that there have been a couple of internship questions posted recently, so I hope one more won't hurt anyone...
I'm a graphic design student graduating this coming May (2006) so I am working on a printed portfolio book to send out to people in hopes of getting an internship. I'm trying to make a list of people to send my portfolio to, but some insider suggestions would definetly help. I live in Montreal, but I'm really looking outside for something. The States would be great since it's so close, and Europe would be insane too.
To anyone here... I'm english, I'm french, I have 4 years design experience in packaging...
Any help would be greatly appreciated! I'm looking to send out my stuff early September.
Please help me!
Ps. Jean Francois Porchez- La première copie sera envoyée à vous. Elle a été promis en janvier, je m'excuse d'avance pour le retard : )
Pps. Merci pour la correction Hrant. After all , I am english before french, but I try : )</div>

<div class=commentbody>Allison, packaging artists are always in demand in the NYC Metropolitian area. Try getting a list of them here and apply early so you have choices. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Dan, I'll try to look through the site to see if I can find any. It's hard to figure out which places are good and which aren't.
For this internship, I'm not focusing too much on the packaging, more on working in an amazing place where I can learn alot. I've done intensive courses with JFP and Ruedi Baur in which I learnt technical things, but also ways of thinking and working, which were amazing experiences, but only lasted 7 days. I'm trying to find something similar to these, but over a longer period of time. (I'm not afraid of working like a dog, or for free, as long as I am getting better at what I do. So I'm hoping to stay away from small companies just looking for free labor.)
For this September, I'd like to send my stuff to about 20 places. So I'm trying to figure out who these 20 people are, places that are really "high up" there. I've figured out about 10 of them, but the last 10...
Any advice? anyone? please...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Allison, I suppose you were just generalizing, but don't think that big companies aren't looking for free (or almost free) labor too. Most nice indie typefoundries, for example, are small companies, but you could still learn a lot there. Anyway, good luck on your search!</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I completely agree with you Gabriel. I'm very open to go anywhere, in any field of design. I just want to make sure I'm applying to the right places.
For example, from what I've read, Dumbar in the Netherlands is a great place to intern. You really get pushed to do the best you can (better than you thought possible.) And they're open to taking interns from anywhere in the world, as long as you're good enough.
Lars Müller Publishing is another one. Just spending time with that group would change the way I work and think.
I know that these two are probably near impossible for me to get into, but at this point, with a little time to spare, I want to try. If all I get is some good criticism, I'll be happy.
Would anyone have any suggestions? Maybe you guys know some great people I could look into. Small, medium, large, which ever.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Allison, large firms won't allow you to do much more than make the coffee I agree with gabrielhi. There is a small packaging firm in Manhattan that redesigned a lot of the Frito-Lays products and redesigned the Pepsi can (verticle) and that show has about 10 people in it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm sure I'll be able to find it. To date, I've only found info crediting the new design to Landor... I think they might fall into the "giant corporation/one cream, two sugars" category.</div>
