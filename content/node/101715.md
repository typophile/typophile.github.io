  body: "Thanks.\r\n\r\nAttached is the phrase HUDSON'S BAY in WalbaumMT expanded
    by 134%, i.e. so that the width to height ratio of capital O matches Engraver's
    RomanBT.  Not quite right. But when it is expanded 155%, i.e. so that the width
    to height ratio of capital S matches, it's pretty close.\r\n\r\nWith some letter
    to letter adjustments, and minor changes to the serif design and the top left
    stroke extension for A [and probably for M & N],  Walbaum could work as a font
    approximation of this wordmark. Can't use it for anything unless I start from
    my own Walbaum digitized from an old time print specimen and use a new trade name.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WalbaumMTexpanded134percent_6020.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/WalbaumMTexpanded155percent_5969..jpg]"
