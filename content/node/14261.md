body: I am looking for an elegant text font that was designed (and used) mid-20th
  century (c. 1910-1915). Sanserif is preferable. It would be nice if the font is
  a complete family (bold, book, italics, etc.) and in TrueType-- again, desireable,
  but not essential. Thanks very much.

    This is only available from Linotype in PostScript format, but we do have both
    Mac and PC PS.\r\n\r\nThere is also Cheltenham (a Serif), News Gothic, Franklin
    Gothic, and Scotch (another Serif). These are probably all available in several
    versions from several foundries, most likely as complete families, and in TrueType
    format.\r\n\r\nDo check out this <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/14173\">other
    thread</a> on Souvenir, which is based on several elements from your period in
    question. Although at first glance, it might not be the right fit, I think that
    it could work out quite interestingly.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "I really get excited by pre-WWI types (late 1920s and 30s work is just too
    clean for me. I love Metro, Tiff, but its too good of a typeface to represent
    pre-war decadence, in my opinion. Or at least pre-first-world war decadence\u2026).\r\n\r\nHere
    is a bunch of stuff I've found over the past hour. None of them probably fit perfectly.
    But hey. Type c.1912 was a bit odd.\r\n\r\nFirst is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/astype/sveva-as-versal/\">Sveva</a>
    by Andreas Seidel, who rocks. Just OpenType, just caps, just serifs, but also

    (Linotype has it in PC, but not Mac, TrueType)\r\n\r\nLikewise in PC TT (as well
    as Mac PS and PC PS, of course) is this neat little sans serif family, <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/43516/britannic-family.html\">Britannic</a>\r\n\r\nMorris
    Fuller Benton's Clearface cannot be ignored. <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/616/itcclearface-family.html\">ITC
    Clearface</a> is the serif version, <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/264/clearfacegothic-family.html\">Clearface
    Gothic</a> the sans (Clearface Gothic, aside from PostScripts, and PC TT, is also
    available from Linotype in OpenType format!).\r\n\r\nHow about <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/cognac/\">Cognac</a>?\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.linotype.com/267/cochin-family.html\">Cochin</a>, 1914. So French.
    <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/90038/nicolascochin-family.html\">Nicolas Cochin</a>,
    smaller x-height, more period acurate, I think, listed as coming from 1912 even
    though it is virtually the same as the above-named 1914 fonts\u2026 hmm.\r\n\r\n<a

    it is also way out of the date range, might fit.\r\n\r\nI think that, like Lightline/News/Franklin
    Gothic, Erbar is a nice synthesis of what came before it. I see Kabel as a brilliant
    new invention, personally.\r\n\r\n[[Rudolf Koch]] only got in one real typeface
    before WWI, the Deutsche Schrift. But I think that Neuland fits Art Nouveau decadence
    nicely, even though it was cut during the 1920s.\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "Dan, and all,\r\n\r\nThanks very much for the advice and research. The project
    is a catalog and programmatic graphics for the early modernist artist Henry Fitch
    Taylor (1853-1925). I believe the curator is looking for something with a Vienna
    Secessionist feel. However, these faces tend to be decorative and unsuitable as
    text. I like Kabel, but it is too late (historically). I originally did comps
    in the Neutraface family, which I like and may be able to sell. But it is, after
    all, a contemporary family. Though I'd prefer sanserif, Belwe is indeed nice.\r\n\r\nI
    am considering Venus, Brittanic and Clearface, but I think they lack italics.
    Getting close, or, one hopes, just going with Neutraface.\r\n\r\nI wish I could
    get a copy of the \"Schriften Atlas\" for reference.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: As you were considering Venus, I was going to suggest the magnificent Vonness
    superfamily which has four widths (Extended, Regular, Condensed and Compressed)
    and seven weights (Thin, Light, Book, Medium, Bold, Extra Bold, Black), all with
    matching italics -- yup, 56 fonts in total -- which I reviewed for [[Typographer.org]]'s
    TypeCon2005 keepsake booklet. Unfortunately, it looks like [[The Font Bureau]],
    Inc. hasn't released it yet. :-/

  body: I would think they, The Font Bureau Inc., will hold that family close to their
    chest, so to speak, for a little longer. A typeface like that is almost too nice
    to publicly release.

    had italic counterparts, and if so they were more likely to be sloped versions
    of the regular. Anyone else know something more on this?
