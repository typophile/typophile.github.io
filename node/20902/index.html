He used to stretch a Helvetica Black Condened to 200% instead of using Helvetica Black Extended. He used RGB-images at 72 dpi & blew them up to somewhere between 150 & 200% (in Quark, not changing the image size in Photoshop). It's a miracle the company survived so long ;-)
At one point, I started keeping a log of all the things he f*cked up, but after only a few days I had to give that up because it was far too time-consuming.
Oh, and he always used the bold/italic/...-"styles" instead of the proper fonts. Any idea how ugly a bold, italic University Roman looks like?</div>

He had taken type and Photoshop-beveled the hell out of it. When I asked him about the reasoning behind such an atrocity, he proclaimed it was to create the illusion of depth, acting as though I was a fool for not seeing the obvious answer.

Deep down I don't think anyone really thinks that anyway, it's primarily a defense mechanism for insecuriity. The problem is if you think you know it all you may never realize what the real problem is.

The ego and insecurity are forever bound…

To a large degree I think that's what the dance called design is all about.

Paul, you are entirely correct: only truly ignorant people believe that they know everything that can be known about a particular subject or subjects: every truly intelligent person I have ever known has not been afraid to admit his or her ignorance on a great many subject, even their own fields of expertise.

Ignorance is no crime: we are all born ignorant, and overcome it to varying degrees as we grow...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah interesting points about learning processes.

Perhaps a slight digression ...
I have reached a stage of my visual design career, where I now feel I HAVE to focus more on the process, the experimentation, the discovery of ideas and solutions that may not have been discovered whilst thinking "we've only got THIS time to produce a (e.g) financial report" or "the client has given us examples of what they'd like" - until now I believe my understanding of brief delivery and interpretation has existed within a kind of bubble. It's bursting that bubble ... I think ... that holds truly good ideas and truly rewarding results for a career I love.

Basically ... the future is bright, adn bright is exciting.
