  body: I like it. Maybe the loop of d is a little too large (or the counter is a
    little too small). Also the loop of p doesn't flow as nicely as the one of d.

  body: "Riccard0,\r\n\r\nthanks for your comment! I personally like the shaping of
    \u2018d\u2019 while it resembles falus a bit \u2013 which is correct in this case
    :) But I will try more variants. And you are totally right about the loop of \u2018p\u2018,
    I should work more on that. And on \u2018h\u2019 as well, it\u2019s not as \u2018swanky\u2018
    as I want :)\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

    higher, close to the middle of x-height. The same apply for d_e and d_o."
