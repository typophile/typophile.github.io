		<div class="commentbody">hello timd 
you won&rsquo;t belive this! now this guy does not know how to make a vector file and has made this in paintshop. the N and Y are too close to each other and the first triangle does not connect to the second one again
overall it seems to be the design that i think i am going with and i gave him a partial payment for the use of the idea and the design. i do not think that i have lost too much since i have found a design that can work for me.now i guess i have to try to get this in a vector format i downloaded a copy of inkscape so i just have to learn a little or maybe get someone to do it 
by the way before i lost the last topic someone suggested this. it looks nice but i think is too heavy for the site what do you think <img src="/images/old-images/horizontal_5438_6357.jpg" alt="">
thank you very much for all the help</div>

<p>This was the designer* of that logo and it does have potential, but as you say it is overpowering at the moment, try contacting him and see if he is willing/able to work on it further.

although the wall is very hard but i hear cracks it is either the wall or my skull lol
the designer could not make a vector file i do not know why?!
so we came to an agreement and i get to use the idea but i had to make it myself
i found inkscape downloaded and started playing with it but i could not use the font that he was using so i had to start fresh</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I really did not want to get into the experiments that I did with the two colors but here we go.
I also noticed the extensive use of these colors by other big retailers like sears 
I started experimenting in my own store I painted one of the walls in the light green and noticed that people generally stayed longer in my store specially women. I added a large orange design on one of the walls. I had a 5% increase in sales in that section it seems that the green makes the people more relaxed and orange helps them to make decision easier
now i am not a college grad but I had been in sales for 20 years and have learned that a lot of small things add up to big success for example we used to cover the floor of the store with shredded newspaper to look busier.Color has more benefit than just design. 
So when I started with this concept I decided to use these colors
now if some one can point to a couple of fonts that i can use for my logo to get a nice clean fresh design please point me to it 
also what do you think about the little ilustration rather than stock photo</div>

<p>This was on Boingboing, sneaky retailers, the tiles trick is particularly creative.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t your logo changed since you first posted that revision? I thought I saw it with the crown on the left and without the mysterious (read superfluous and ambiguous) swoosh under it. The illustration isn&rsquo;t bad, although the hand (always a difficult thing to draw) is not very well rendered and the pizza looks as though it has green and yellow jellybeans on it and the salami seems more detailed than the rest of the illustration, if it possible to tone down those areas it might improve it, however if you can&rsquo;t it is serviceable. I really wouldn&rsquo;t use the earlier iteration of the logo in the find restaurant column.</p>
<p>As you know from the first thread I think the decision over avoiding the obvious colours was correct. What are you looking for from a new font, which areas do you want to use it – the sans and serif you are using are fairly well matched although the weights and sizes in the welcome section need some rationalisation.

i knew about some of them but a few new ones for sure
i heard that they also use green and blue in jails to relax the inmates but i am not sure
i think i might have fixed my logo but i would appreciate if you take a look
also i think i made the pizza more realistic 
i also changes the recycled logo to an icon i had made as a fall back for a new logo
i am also going to stay with the fonts since i am not really good with them and i will work on their size and weight as soon as i settle on the content 100%

		<div class="commentbody">And there goes the logo again:)
It is kind of tricky to keep track of your logo iterations, the crown in the current one is not working as a unit with the lettering, either centre on the stem of P or centre on the width of P. Toning down the colours of the illustration have improved it and the icons are far better than the recycled logo. On the copy in your site I recommend you look at the periods a lot of them have spaces before and not every abbreviation of Ave or St has one.

i am going crazy 
i found this font and i figured the tall letters are more NY and more importantly it would allow me to take the angel out of the crown. this way i would be able to make it more even. 
i centered it on the width of p exactly, but i can&rsquo;t figure out how the placement of the crown from the high point of the p should be.</p>

it looks clean and sharp and works with the site 
i think i can also use it and maybe even with the illustration to make decals to put on the doors of the restaurants and on postcards for advertising and things like that
you know if i can get the pizzeria owners to each chip in a few hundred dollars a month i would have a good amount of advertising budget. there are about 350 of them you know.maybe even stop domino lol
so if you don&rsquo;t have any other suggestion i think i should call this the final version and leave it alone

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow - this looks nice. It&rsquo;s almost too nice for your colour scheme. I&rsquo;d make the green a little more silvery, and the orange a bit more burnt. The new logo suggests somewhat of an art deco elegance.</p>
<p>As for the position of the crown, I&rsquo;d align the centre spike with the centre of the counter of the &lsquo;P&rsquo; (a little to the left of where it is now). The vertical placement in version 3 looks the best.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks to timd he is a real gentelman 
i managed a crown with a little more detail and wonder if i should use the crown with the band  seems to pullthe crown together but i don;t know about the overall effect
<img src="/images/old-images/pizza_delivery_york2crown_5353.gif" alt="">
i also made the narrow lines in N and Y a little bolder and also the a in pizza i don&rsquo;t know if i ruined the font but it seemed a little hard to read
if the head band adds to the logo then i will polish it up ofcourse</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It is my pleasure. I would say that it is too much to include the headband the simple lines of the earlier version are far better and the same goes for the letterforms, the more extras you add, the less elegance. Lex&rsquo;s point about the horizontal position might be worth trying, just a touch to the left.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, that is better harmony with the lettering, and I agree the colours are a little too tonally similar in the second.
