body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Hi Typos, <BR> <BR>Looking for
  a casual, friendly handwritten face for a tourist industry design. A kind of &#34;Wish
  you were here&#34; on the postcard sort of thing. <BR> <BR>Also may need to have
  a somewhat thicker stroke width than your average handwritten face to ensure good
  legibility on screen and/or when layered over photographs with bright/tropical colors.
  <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>  -t&#60;/font&#62;'
