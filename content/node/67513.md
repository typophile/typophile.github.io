  body: "At first glance, the things I notice are:\r\n\r\nd: There seems to be a lump
    on the bottom left of the outside curve that should be sanded off. The b looks
    good, so base your proportions for the d on it. It looks like the counter  of
    the b is a little bit wider than the d, too.\r\n\r\nf: The crossbar is too square.\r\nt:
    The crossbar is too rounded. Something more like a rounded rectangle would be
    less obviously computer generated, but you may want to do it by hand. Look at
    a closeup of Garamond or Arno or anything based on metal type. They are generally
    rounded, but not necessarily evenly.\r\n\r\np: Looks well proportioned.\r\nq:
    Looks less well proportioned. I would take the b, flip it, and change the serif
    because you got it right on the b.\r\n\r\nOverall it looks nice. I think the c,
    b, r, and k look really good. I think the bottom serifs look a bit fat\u2014I'd
    rather see them toned down a bit\u2014but that's just my personal preference.\r\n\r\nNice
    work."

  body: "How committed are you to the open bowls? b and q are pretty, but readers
    will stumble over the slight h-ness and y-ness of them. They would be easier to
    read if you closed them, or closed that end of the curve and opened the other
    end. Actually, I would recommend b completely closed, q open on the bottom, and
    p and d as they are (but fixed as Bill said). a, on the other hand, would not
    be hurt by an open bowl, so you could experiment with that.\r\n\r\na has some
    of the same weight problem as d. The top terminal of f might be a little heavy."
