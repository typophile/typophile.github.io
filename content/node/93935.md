  from a font I'm currently pushing around the drawing board.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/K.jpg\">\r\n\r\nI
  thought it might have already been done in Huxley Vert., but it's upside down, lol.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance :)\r\n\r\nn."

    such as this one: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/prop-a-ganda/pag-syndicate/\r\nTheir
    reference is |\u041A| rather than |K|. In a latin script it could look a bit too
    much |R|."

  body: The only time I have seen something like this is on LCDs for hand-held electronic
    card games. It is a variation of the standard seven-segment display for digits
    0-9, with the diagonal added to create the characters Q and K. (The characters
    A and J can already be made with a seven-segment display.)

    spirituality of the letter's shape due to its resemblance to a certain confluence
    of rivers... one of which is invisible.

    ...lol! I started flipping some of my fonts and found quite a few. I also found
    some roots in the graff scene too...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/K_examples.jpg\">\r\n\r\n...some
