body: "I'm pretty lost on where I'd like to go with my own logo. I've even hired someone
  to help me steve jenks(retrodc.com). The previous logo was a quick slapdash idea.
  Name of the company is holy molee photography. \r\n\r\nThe idea is a best friend
  of mine would do wedding photography together. Now he's lost interest and I've kind
  taken over. Well the concept of the logo is merging names \"Moler & Lee\".\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I am by far no expect at graphic design. I did this by hacking away didot in illustrator.
  I've tried to imitate this type: http://www.vman.com/1_davidsims_orlandobloom.php
  and customize it in my own way. \r\n\r\nCommunicately, I'd like to express some
  flair of high fashion influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_6670.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/old_4953.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you guys think?"

  body: "If you expect the spectator (let alone the casual or hurried spectator) to
    recognize an 'h' and an 'm' you are asking too much.\r\n\r\nFor starters, the
    'h' is cropped by the left edge. Look at the 'h' right at that point: The thin
    horizontal line grows into the vertical stem in a smooth curve, identical to the
    curves in the 'm'. But it should not be a curve, it should be a 90 degree corner,
    to facilitate the identification of the 'h'.\r\n\r\nAt least, *I* had this problem
    ... have you tested this design (ie showed it to friends and family) and asked
    them what they see?\r\n\r\nSome may see 'hm'\r\nSome may see 'lm'\r\nSome may
    see 'hi'\r\nSome may just see Mother Penguin and her two children.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you should try other fonts, other ideas as well. Stick to the 'feeling' that the
    Orlando Bloom type design gave you, while you try other variations.\r\n\r\nHey
    - great photo of OB ... all of a sudden, he looks interesting ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A \"play of letters\" logo doesn't have to make the audience realize which
    letters it's playing with. It only needs to make sense for those who do know what
    they represent. (For example my avatar, which should read \"hj\" -- most people
    wouldn't recognize that without being told, but once they're told it should be
    quite obvious.)\r\n\r\nThat said, I have to admit I'm confused about what letters
    the new logo is supposed to represent, too.\r\n\r\nPurely optically, the new logo
    is fine and most definitely an improvement to the old one."

    An uppercase H in a sans serif with pointed crossbar instead of a straight one
    would form an M.\r\n\r\nAnyway, see some rough sketches below to get a better
    idea of what I am talking about\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hm_5707.jpg]"

  body: "Henry:\r\n\r\nI see that makes sense. In my case of the current design, I
    think my logo is just pure dada - eye candy more than content. I'd like to introduce
    something more communicative.\r\n\r\nDavid:\r\nThat was pretty helpful. Actually
    your uppercase makes more sense. It looks like two people holding hands.\r\n\r\nI'd
    prefer it to say HMLP but its more harmonious looking was HML. Now with some revision
    and collaboration with this graphic designer we've reduced the visual content
    of the form to just HM. I chose lowercase because I liked the repetition of the
    negative space (in the previous logo)."

  body: This all seems to rest on an important point - the fact that you're using
    the initals to represent the company name. I think the company name is distinctive
    and appealing - why hide that behind the initials? Why not make a feature of the
    actual company name?

    photographer (incidentally the company name was longer than yours). It's just
    that initals, to me, seem corporate and not particularly welcoming, whereas your
    company name is very unusual, (verging on cute) and gives a friendlier appearance
    and it's a real shame not to use it. That's my reasoning, at any rate."

  body: "I am currently doing a logo for a wedding photographer myself. I am guessing
    that you may need similar branding as you are in the same field. My client is
    already well established so I listened to their requirements and as I had guessed
    the requirements called for legible, slightly innovative lettering with a strong
    connection between letterforms. We will be  exploring ligatures, unicase, etc...\r\nYour
    work was classic looking when you started but lacked recognition of the characters.
    The new version is slightly more legible but is now bulky, which from what I have
    seen in the competitive field of wedding photography does not associate with the
    subject matter you specialize in. \r\n\r\nI would be a bit careful with following
    Henry's advice. I don't completely disagree but think it is a bit of a dangerous
    path. \r\n\r\nI think David's second design is simple and very nice. "
