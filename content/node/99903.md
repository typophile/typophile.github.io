  body: "These look like they were done with a CAD plotter (or at least replicating
    that style). \r\nhttp://lineto.com/ offers many fonts in that style, but I don't
    know if any are as compressed as this.\r\nBryant Compressed http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/bryant-compressed/
    is another similar typeface."
