    border=0> <BR> <BR>No seriously, apart from the &#39;c&#39; and &#39;r&#39;s resemblance
    to Miles  <BR>Newlyn&#39;s &#40;much better&#41; Democratica, this doesn&#39;t
    ring a bell.

    catholic churches&#34; <BR> <BR>What a big surprise! Where are those hispanic
    letters? <BR> <BR>Anybody?'

  body: Maybe... I&#39;m not an expert in the lettering from that period, though I
    am enough aged to remenber it. Perhaps is because the memory is so selective...
    <BR> <BR>Anyway, I think Drone is inspired in _bad_ lettering, hispanic or not.
    I don&#39;t see nothing specifically hispanic or, at least, Spanish in those letters.
    It reminds you the Arco del Triunfo &#40;symptomatic name...&#41; because you
    hate it. I&#39;d never been at the Valle de los Ca
