  custom design made by [[http://www.helsinkitypestudio.com/|Helsinki Type Studio]]
  for the [[http://www.werklig.com/solutions/design-museum/|Finnish Design Museum]].\r\nAs
  we can't find an available exact match, can I ask help to find the closest possible
  ?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nL."

    is close, but it could be used to similar effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In Alphaville? \r\nThe design utilizes a 37\u02DA angled upstroke, which
    didn\u2019t \uFB01t the construction of the /S, so its form is orthogonal.\r\n(Although
    I did cheat with the /X, but that\u2019s not used very much so I felt I could
    get away with it.)"

    /I has serifs.\r\nSo it\u2019s not a complete anomaly."
