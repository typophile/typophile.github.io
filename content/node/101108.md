    but I don't think that's the one mainly because of /T and /A crossbar.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    closer look [[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NJk2ZOrcZh8/UII9ZmPJkvI/AAAAAAAAEKU/hiKk8ugg5uw/s1600/IMG_2223.jpg|here]]
    and [[http://www.marcolini-eboutique.com/publishingImages/catalog/TR00021_large.jpg|here]].
    More samples and letters [[http://www.marcolini-eboutique.com/en-en/tablets-and-treats?category=Tablets(Marcolini-Base)|here]].
    Reminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/trajan|Trajan]] (/N missing top
    left serif /N, /M slopping verticals) but that's clearly not it. Some more I like:

  body: 'Surprising that nobody has come up with the answer. Serifs are clearly not
    my specialty but, with such a /Q, faux small-caps and the rest set in Engravers
    Gothic/Blair, I really doubt a bespoke typeface has been drawn especially for
    this occasion. '
