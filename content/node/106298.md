  body: "Nothing in ATF 1934.\r\nBut fonts came and went very rapidly at the onset
    of the Great Depression. Many new designs but the supply of purchasers was almost
    nothing.\r\nSome similar treatments:\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/similar?3U3\r\nBut
    all of these are sans serif.\r\nThe Vogue font is unusual because the treatment
    is applied to a serif font.\r\nDon\r\n"
