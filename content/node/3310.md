body: Working on a catalog, and I&#39;ve run into an instance where I have a period
  following a trademarked word. What&#39;s the proper formatting? If I let it be without
  modifying, the period is spaced after the &#40;tm&#41;, a full space from the &#39;s&#39;,
  which looks really awkward. So I&#39;ve adjusted the kerning so the period is right
  next to the &#39;s&#39;. See attachment.  <BR> <BR>Any rules you know of? <BR> <BR><img

  body: Thanks, Nathan. So judging from that thread, sounds like it&#39;s really up
    to me? I didn&#39;t see anything too concrete one way or the other.

  body: From what I remember &#40;and remember of that thread, too lazy to go look&#41;
    ... if rules are what you need then you should have the period follow the TM ...
    Because, the TM following the period implies that the period belongs within the
    trademark. However, visually, for headlines are large type, I&#39;d say just do
    as your image shows.
