  body: "HP has a problem with hints when printing that I wish I knew about before
    I bought my HP ( not the same model). I get around it by testing minus hints and
    then add the hints. Which in reality is the way type making works in general.
    Still, it's a stupid bug and I wish they would solve it. \r\n\r\nI have a lot
    of empathy for you position in looking. There is no obvious good answer that I
    can see unless you want to shell out very heavily for a Xante. But even then you
    might want a POS printer to see what the worst might be like... You can console
    yourself with the knowledge that there is no one right proofing choice for you.
    No silver bullet - except to be aware of what you are aiming for and what methods
    you want it to work well in and find a way to have it tested there. So if it is
    fine offset - make pals with a printer and see if you can run stuff in the margins
    - and so on. \r\n\r\nThere are several threads on Typophile that address similar
    questions and in many ways what I have written here is a nutshell summary of them
    along with a little salt of my own. Still, I encourage you to dig them up via
    a google site specific search and see what was said and by whom."

    that PCL is at least as complex as PS. However, when PS is transformed to PCL,
    mathematical rounding errors are unavoidable, but the same also happens, when
    you embed TT fonts into a PDF and make a printout on a PS printer, so it is difficult

    is that the hints operate all the time, but only make a noticeable difference
    at low resolution. So there is often not much effect in printing. However with
    small sizes, the details of the joins and serifs can be affected, as only a small
    number of dots may be involved. So if you are proofing a text type, most laster
    printers will mislead you as to how photo offset printing will render the outlines.
    There are other issues, such as whether the outlines are rendered too thick or
    thin, etc. '
