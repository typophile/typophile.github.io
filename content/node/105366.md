    which I\u2019m guessing was probably altered for the logo."

  body: "It does indeed resemble Perpetua Titling Light MT, and it may be someone's
    interpretation under another name because there are other differences in all glyphs
    except for the /I. It could also be that it was modified especially for this logo.\r\n\r\nIf
    you need to come close, then Perpetua Titling Light MT is the font of choice.
    If you need an exact match, then more looking is in order. \r\n\r\nThat being
    said, if it was modified especially for the logo, and I strongly suspect that
    it was, then you will not likely find it as a complete font."
