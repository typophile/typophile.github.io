  for typefaces that are evocative of the UK in the 20th century (specifically fashion)
  from 1920-80. Any thoughts welcome. thank you."

    1970 and London 1980, for a retro-inspired series of typefaces:\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet\r\n\r\nAnother
    good resource is www.fontsinuse.com, which breaks out type use by industry (including
    fashion). Sadly, not all samples are dated and the search function beyond the
    main categories is a bit clunky, but it may prove useful--and amusing.\r\n\r\nAlso
    good (collection is grouped by decades):\r\nhttp://www.advertisingarchives.co.uk/en/page/show_home_page.html\r\n\r\n"

    Gill Sans because I don't like what he was like as a person?"

  body: I'm not sure if it's silly or not, but I won't use Gill Sans (which, visually,
    I quite like) for the same reason. I don't care to have my work associated with
    Eric Gill, if only in my own mind.

  body: "photosynthesize, the debate about whether art can and should be considered
    separate from the artist exists in most media (I've debated it mostly in the world
    of fine art). I don't think it's silly at all.\r\n\r\nNor do I have a definitive
    pronouncement on the subject. Short of supporting an artist's ongoing and active
    malfeasance, I think people can and should decide for themselves whether to appreciate
    the art on its own merits, and to determine their own criteria for appreciation.\r\n\r\nIf
    using Eric Gill's typefaces makes you uncomfortable, there are plenty of other
    options out there. "
