  body: Peter -- <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to guess that what is happening is the translation
    from FOG to Postscript to FL. Postscript doesn&#39;t make a distinction about
    point types, coding only the coordinates of the on-curve points and the associated
    control points. If I&#39;m not mistaken, PS doesn&#39;t handle decimal places,
    so coordinates are rounded to the nearest integer when a PS font is generated.
    Non-orthogonal curves and tangents are particularly susceptible to this. <BR>
    <BR>When FL reads the PS data from the font, I&#39;m guessing that if the points
    aren&#39;t exactly colinear &#40;due to rounding&#41; that FL will not interpret
    them as tangent points per se. I would presume that your points and controls are
    still in the proper places &#40;allowing for rounding&#41;. I&#39;d be curious
    to see a screenshot with the control handles showing. For instance, did FL add
    a handle to the bottom side of that lower, outside curve point? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    just starting the arduous transition to FL myself and am by no means an expert.
    Someone more technically savvy, like John Hudson, might have a better explanation.

  body: Peter -- <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been thinking about this and spending some time
    with the FontLab manual.  <BR>I had an insight that I think might help. <BR> <BR>The
    FOG model is point-based. But the FontLab model is segment-based.  <BR> <BR>What
    I mean is that in FOG you are usually focused on what kind of point  <BR>you&#39;re
    placing. Whereas in FL, the emphasis is on what kind of line segment  <BR>is being
    operated on. FOG has three kinds of points -- corner, curve, and  <BR>tangent.
    FL doesn&#39;t make these distinctions. <BR> <BR>FL distinguishes between two
    different kinds of line segment -- a straight line  <BR>&#40;which they also call
    a <i>vector</i>&#41; and a curve &#40;a bezier curve&#41;. A curve is described  <BR>by
    four points -- two end points on the curve &#40;<i>nodes</i>&#41; and the two
    bezier  <BR>control points on the handles. A straight line is controlled by only
    two nodes --  <BR>one at either end, with no control handles. <BR> <BR>FL also
    distinguishes two different kinds of transitions between line segments --  <BR>a
    node can either be a smooth connection or a sharp connection. <BR> <BR>So, if
    you have a curve meeting another curve, then the node will have two  <BR>control
    handles, one contributing to each of the two curves. If the connection  <BR>is
    smooth, then the two handles will be co-linear -- that is, they are linked  <BR>and
    stay aligned with each other -- so this kind of node is what FOG would call  <BR>a
    curve point.  <BR> <BR>If two curves meet and the connection is sharp, then the
    two control handles  <BR>can be moved independent from one another. This node
    would then constitute  <BR>a corner point in FOG. <BR> <BR>If two straight line
    segments meet, then the node does not have any control  <BR>handles and is necessarily
    sharp. This would also be considered a corner point  <BR>in FOG. <BR> <BR>If a
    straight line meets a curve, then the node will have one control handle on  <BR>the
    curve side. If the connection is sharp, then this control handle can move  <BR>any
    which way and the node would be considered a corner point in FOG.  <BR> <BR>But
    if the connection is smooth, then the control handle on the curve side  <BR>will
    be co-linear with the vector segment meeting up with the curve and will  <BR>only
    move in a line with this vector -- and this is what FOG would call  <BR>a tangent
    point. <BR> <BR>Does this help? <BR> <BR>So, you need to notice whether the node
    between a straight line and a curve  <BR>is smooth or sharp. When it is selected,
    you will see off to the side of the  <BR>node either a circle &#40;smooth connection&#41;
    or an x &#40;sharp connection&#41;. You can  <BR>also turn on all connection types
    for every node, whether selected or not, by  <BR>selecting the button from the
    View/Show Layers toolbar. <BR> <BR>So, for example, if you select the node on
    the top of the inside of your  <BR>counter, you will see whether it is a smooth
    connection or not. If it isn&#39;t,  <BR>then double click the node to toggle
    the connection style. When the connection  <BR>is smooth, then you can change
    the &#34;curve&#34; on the right side to a straight line  <BR>by selecting the
    right control handle of the node and deleting it. &#40;Deleting  <BR>either control
    handle of a segment will convert it to a straight line vector, since  <BR>a curve
    needs to be defined by two control handles.&#41; <BR> <BR>Once the right-hand
    segment is a straight line and the left-hand segment is a  <BR>curve and the node
    is a smooth connection, then the handle on the left will  <BR>only move in line
    with the straight segment and you will have, in effect, a  <BR>tangent point.
    <BR> <BR>I hope this makes sense and is helpful. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>

  body: 'To follow up on Kent&#39;s thorough description, I wanted to add that FL
    has an excellent way of keeping users on their toes with regard to what is allowed
    in the world of PostScript Type 1 fonts: <BR> <BR>FL doesn&#39;t let you form
    a curve by anything other than two points with control handles. In Fontographer,
    you&#39;re allowed to create a curve that has a BCP handle on one end, and an
    &#34;empty&#34; point on the other end. But this can produce errors, since it
    is effectively creating a point-on-top-of-point situation. FL shows you that this
    is happening by immediately introducing a complimentary BCP handle when you create
    a curved segment. It invites you to define the curve properly. <BR> <BR>FL also
    makes you aware of the nature of Type 1 curves, by making the &#34;closepath&#34;
    and start/end points a tangible part of the path. This can be disorienting at
    first, and seem like a hassle, but it reveals the nature of the curves and allows
    greater control. <BR> <BR>Lastly, if you turn on the &#34;connection type&#34;
    layer as Kent suggests, FL does another neat thing: when two consecutive BCP handles
    cross each other&#39;s paths, the connection type indicator flips to the opposite
    side of the point, notifying you that the curve is not constructed as well as
    it could be. <BR> <BR>Lastly lastly, setting the preferences to show points in
    color is another handy visual cue.'

  body: Yes, Hrant. To the best of my knowledge, that is considered a Type 1 no-no.
    It&#39;s my understanding that BCPs are considered points, along with vertices.
    When you create a one-sided curve, you are invisibly creating a BCP on the opposite
    end of the curve. That invisible BCP &#40;invisible in Fog, at least&#41; is located
    directly on top of the vertex, so then you have a point-on-point situation. Whether
    or not this is as likely to cause spiking as two vertices on top of each other,
    I&#39;m not sure. But it&#39;s worth staying away from it &#40;yeah, it&#39;s

    best of my <BR> understanding I&#39;m not so sure that the one-bcp-handled  <BR>curve
    is necessarily &#34;illegal.&#34; The thing is that the  <BR>various Postscript
    <b>curveto</b> commands require a  <BR>set number of arguments, based on the assumption
    of  <BR>two handles and endpoints &#40;actually, the first point is a  <BR>given,
    so generally only six arguments are required.  <BR>You can reference the T1 Font
    Format, Ch. 6, pg 52.&#41; <BR> <BR>The thing about FL is that it constructs curves
    with the  <BR>same assumption. But if you create a single-handled  <BR>curve in
    FOG, all that means is that the generated PS  <BR>instruction will contain a few
    arguments whose values  <BR>are zero. There&#39;s no restriction or caution about
