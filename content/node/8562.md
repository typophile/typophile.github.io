    <BR> <BR>Anyway, with Matha, we currently work on a free blogin French who will
    cover all the type related events in France. We hope do a public announcement
    in couple of days, when the others guys/friends have posted their first news too.

    the benefits of ATypI are in large part &#34;intangible&#34;. For some people
    it&#39;s an obligation of sorts, and for a lot of people it&#39;s not a &#34;sound
    investment&#34;: you become a member if you love type. And John is right, you
    should be thinking how <i>you</i> could help. <BR> <BR>One very tangible benefit

  body: Yes, Hrant and John, I agree... I joined ATypI because I love type, and no
    one would choose to study type design because he/she wants to make tons of money.
    So, yes, I think the most important thing is the community that you get when you
    join an association like ATypI... <BR> <BR>BUT, with the internet, it might be
    just as easy to get support from other typographer/type designers... A good example
    is this board. I would still like to see tangible support and benefits, beause
    it is not cheap to join. I&#39;m really not the kind who thinks about economic
    returns... it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t have a ton of money to spend. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    more than happy to help... I would in fact like to get some local involvement
    for the next ATypI, and to involve myself. <BR> <BR>K.

    it. But there is a new trend in collecting money for charitable purposes : the
    direct debit. You contribute a smallish sum of money every month without even
    noticing. It helps the organisation in question to plan ahead because they know
    in advance what&#39;s coming in. <BR> <BR>&#62; the benefits of ATypI are in large

    problem is that new members come to ATypI with preconceived ideas of what these
    benefits are and can be very easily disappointed. I know that the fiasco with
    the book in Rome disappointed me but I&#39;ve gotten over it and I&#39;ll live
