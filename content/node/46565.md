  asked to create the label/logo for a new sandwich brand called 'Now that\u2019s
  a Sandwich' the brand values quality and all sandwiches are handmade, the bread
  used is stone oven baked (also handmade) and fully Irish owned using only Irish
  products. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a gourmet, quality sandwich so the design solution obviously
  needs to be reflective of those qualities. Any suggestions on possible typefaces
  or any samples of similar products would be greatly appreciated. This is my first
  job since graduating a few weeks ago so really want it to be effective. \r\n"

  body: I think being Irish and using Irish products is an important aspect of the
    brand so it would be nice to incorporate this with the other values I mentioned.
    I'll have a look for hand-rendered type on food products but if anyone knows of
    any other good samples I'd love to see them. Thanks guys! I love this site your
    all so helpful;)
