  found this in prague. it was in a laundromat. i was wondering if anyone knows the
  typeface. maybe these letterforms were made just for the logotype? i dont know.
  thanks for the help!\r\n"

  body: Critter, this is digital-looking enough that it could be a typeface, but on
    the other hand it seems simple enough that it is more likely hand drawn.

  body: With almost 120 reads to your posts, I guess it's pretty obvious no-one has
    a clue. The chances that this is a typeface and not a custom design become pretty
    slim.
