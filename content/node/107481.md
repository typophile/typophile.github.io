body: "In the 1960s Georg Salden designed an opening advert for an hat shop in Dusseldorf.
  With a broad-nib pen he wrote a bold italic with large swashes. From this written
  text he later developed [[http://www.typemanufactur.com/eng/fonts/daphne/overview.html|Daphne]],
  a strong and sharp-edged typeface which includes a large number of separate swashes.
  These calligraphic swashes can be added to the letters in any order, which provides
  hundreds of possibilities.\r\n\r\nNow, many years later, Salden decided to develop
  a script version of his Daphne typeface. Again, written with a broad-nib pen, Salden
  created an elegant and vital script with luscious swashes and numerous alternate
  characters.\r\n\r\nSee more of the typeface at [[http://www.typemanufactur.com/eng/fonts/daphnescript/overview.html|TypeManufactur]]
