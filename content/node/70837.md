  in detail. As a first step, i am trying to understand type anatomy, to help myself
  i making a simple poster with type anatomy explained, so i can stick it in-front
  of me & let it hammer in my mind. \r\n\r\nTill now, these are the details i am able
  to fetch from various sources : http://nitingarg.com/shared/first-draft.jpg\r\n\r\nNow,
  it would be really helpful if you can just check & let me know if i am missing something
  or done something wrong there.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time !"

    also be;\r\nThe word and the line associated with \"Spur\" don't align with anything;\r\nTechnically,
    \"fi\" as a whole represents a ligature, not simply the crossbar which joins the
    two letters in your example."

    word 'ligature' implies; the OED gives this:\r\n\r\n5.5 In Writing and Printing.
    Two or more letters joined together and forming one character or type; a monogram.
    Also, a stroke connecting two letters. in ligature, combined in one character
    or type. \r\n"

  body: "Overshoot and sidebearing could be added. Possibly kerning, which is sidebearings
    that overlap.\r\n\r\nThe callouts for \"bowl\" and \"counter\" could end in the
    middle of the spaces they describe, not on part of the type that surrounds those
    spaces.\r\n\r\nIn his <em>Short History</em>, Warren Chappell included a drawing
    of a piece of metal type, which gives concrete identity to some of the more abstract
    spatial concepts of typography."

    \"overshoot\" as Nick suggested. \r\nI agree the other Nick that I wouldn't call
    the crossbar in \"fi\" itself a ligature. "

  body: "re. ligature: certainly, the part that joins two letters, is, from an etymological
    point of view, the salient quality of a ligature, but in typography it is generally
    understood that a ligature is a two (or more) character glyph, where the shapes
    of the constituent glyphs are modified as they coalesce. So it's important, for
    instance, not just that there is a single joined crossbar in \"ff\", but that
    the ascenders of the two \"f\"s generally differ in height.\r\n\r\nI was going
    to say that the first f is shorter, but then I remembered Blado."

  body: "Thanks a lot for such valuable replies. Ligature i figured out is a term
    for the whole form made be two characters, not the crossbar. \r\n\r\n@Sir Nick,
    thanks. I got your point, may be placing a 20-30% gray shape indicating the negative
    spaces of counter could be one solution.?\r\n\r\n<em>Thanks Again.</em>"

    was your own research. This is the EXACT same graphic I recently came across when
    I was throwing out old magazines... It was the Oct/Nov 2005 issue of Dynamic Graphics

    comes up about 2nd if you google image search "type anatomy." But then, nothing
    is orginal these days. :-p

    of standards that are applied to originality/homage/plagiarism, in different areas
    of digital culture (and countries).\r\n\r\nNitin appears to have swiped the layout,
    but he has made his own artwork from scratch, changing the font. And as he says,
    this is a starting point.\r\n\r\nThat degree of \"sufficient change\" would be
    quite acceptable in making a font.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of plagiarism has not changed,
    and I think that irrespective of how legal or changed derivative work may be,
    it never hurts to credit one's sources -- this is a perfect usage for metadata.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.docspopuli.org/articles/RecyclingArt.html\r\n\r\nLatest

    we should expect derived work to bring something new to the table as well (new
    features that allow different and/or better use)."
