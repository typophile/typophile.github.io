  The 'Koller' one is taken from an engraved name plate, the other one is from an
  old Tamiya RC car decal.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Koller_4124.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/upset_5142.jpg]"

  body: "Koller is still a mystery. I looked through the Solotype Catalog and saw
    a script called Davenport (p.86) that looks like it might be similar to the style
    used, but not enough letters were shown to see if it was more than similar. I
    also scanned through the Nick Curtis fonts, hoping it was something he had revived,
    but didn't see it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
