body: 'Hello all, <BR> <BR>I am a font design and construction novice. I am using
  fontographer 4, which i&#39;m sure is considered far out-of-date by most type-savy
  people, but please entertain me for just a smidgeon of your time! <BR> <BR>Please
  tell me what in the world is going on here: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/52436.png"
  alt="figure1"> <BR> <BR>many of my characters won&#39;t preview in solid shading.
  i don&#39;t know why! <BR> <BR>letters were drawn in illustrator 8, and copied over.
  <BR> <BR>any help is appreciated. thanks!'

  body: Select all the character cells in the main font window. Choose &#34;Selection
    Info...&#34; from the Element menu. Make sure the Tint is set to 100 &#40;and
    that Stroke is unchecked&#41;. That should fix it. <BR> <BR>What happens is if
    your art in Illustrator is not solid black, it comes out shaded when pasted into
    FOG. Or sometimes it just happens for no apparent reason. Maybe Macromedia will
    issue an update to fix this annoying problem. ;-&#41;

  body: Incidentally, it looks like you&#39;re using kerning to control the space
    between characters instead of putting space in the left and right sidebearings.
    It will be a nightmare to space your font this way.

  body: thanks, mark! <BR> <BR>i extend my heartfelt gratitude also for the tip on
    the spacing. this is my first font, so i am absolutely clueless as to how to go
    about any of this. <BR> <BR>i don&#39;t suppose this is a quick way to set all
    of my side-bearings to a fixed value? it&#39;s going to be nasty to jump back
    in and readjust all of those by hand :} <BR> <BR>thanks again.

    to be the same value. The left hand side of the &#34;a&#34; in your font should
    have a sidebearing about 1/2 that of the right hand side &#40;roughly speaking&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Walter Tracy&#39;s &#34;Letters of Credit&#34; has a good section on
    sidebearings and spacing of letter forms. This is reproduced in Moye&#39;s &#34;Fontographer:
    Type by Design,&#34; but that book is long out of print. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

  body: actually, give or take, i <i>do</i> want a fixed width between each character
    for this particular typeface. sort of like monospacing, but not! <BR> <BR>i will
    look into Tracy&#39;s book. i am well-familiar with the notorious scarcity of
    &#34;type by design.&#34; i have been looking for something to fill the gap. that
    is, a book that focuses mainly on the technicalities of font creation &#40;as
    opposed to design theory&#41;. <BR> <BR>thanks, thomas!

    <BR> <BR>Select all the characters whose sidebearings you want to be the same
    value. Choose &#34;Set Metrics...&#34; from the Metrics menu. The rest should
    be self-explanatory. Caution: Save your font before you proceed just in case you
    don&#39;t like the results.'

    the Metrics menu.
