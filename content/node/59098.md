body: "I\u2019m confused about what should actually go in the asciitilde glyph. Bringhurst
  claims it should be a swung dash, and some type designers seem to have done this,
  but in most fonts the asciitilde is either the tilde diacritical mark, sometimes
  modified to be a little taller and wider. Do people using it for mathematical similarity
  expect to see a swung dash there? Are people actually using it as a diacritical?
  Do end users really care at all?"

  body: "Swung dash or something like it. It shouldn't be raised like the tilde character
    U+02DC, and needs to be large enough to stand out in technical text, but may or
    may not be as wide as the swung dash \u2053.\r\n\r\nThe character is used in programming
    languages, in which usage it is best if it aligns vertically with =.\r\n\r\nI
    can't think of a use for this character in which it would be desirable for the
    glyph to be raised to the height of a diacritic mark."

  body: "From the MS <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/maths.aspx\">character
    design standards</a>:\r\n\r\n<em>    * ASCII tilde\r\n      Unicode: U+007E\r\n\r\n
    \     Design : This character is used in mathematics as an operator for 'is proportional
    or similar to'. This character is also commonly used in text as a sign of approximation.
    The double tilde U+2248 is the correct mathematical operator for ' is approximately
    equal to'.\r\n\r\n          Example of common usage : One inch is ~72 point in
    traditonal typography.\r\n\r\n      This is not the same design and character
    as the lowercase spacing tilde diacritic.\r\n\r\n      Alignment : Vertically
    centers on the plus sign.\r\n\r\n      Advance width : Advance width should be
    the same as the figure space width.\r\n\r\n      Spacing : This character should
    space between figure zeros. </em>"

  body: "I've managed to get this character to fit nicely on the end of lower-case
    italic letters, as a kind of swash.\r\nAlso, in some fonts I've kerned it to make
    a wavy rule when repeated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's also used as a kind of emdash in early, two-CD releases in Japan. For
    example, the two-CD set of Bruce Springsteen's <em>The River</em> has a separate
    catalog number for each disc -- 50DP 355 and 50DP 356 -- and on the package spine
    the catalog number is shown as "50DP 355~6".
