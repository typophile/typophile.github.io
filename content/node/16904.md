    progression of sizes a bit more noticable make the C bigger) and perhaps make
    the stem of the chile at left a bit thinner.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Agreeing with Chris here, a little better progression/chili shape definition
    and it'll be perfect. I'd like to see some different color treatments out of curiosity
    though.

  body: "Miguel, as far as I know the name of the country (Chile) is a native voice,
    not a reference to the actual fruit. Leaving that aside it looks very good, just
    follow Chirs's and David's suggestion.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    to connect more with the l and possibly soften the lefthand tip of the connecting
    stroke of the e and the top of the  stalk.\r\nTim"

  body: You almost have it make a shape that makes the chile a chile. The type alone
    with outline isn't obvious enough.

  body: It's really wonderful. And so close to being really realy strong. I would
    like to see the flourish on the left be bigger & fatter and then maybe something
    done with the dot on the 'i'. Or something. It's very tasty though!

  body: "i really like it miguel. the letterforms by themselves are so expressive.
    but as a chile, i think it might be a little stronger if there were a little more
    'tilt' to the logo, and a little more 'curve', or 'curl' in the pepper.\r\n\r\nas
    it stands, i like the subtlety. i saw the word before i saw the pepper. i like
    the feeling of discovery: first, cool letterforms, then suddenly, a graphic!\r\n\r\ncool."

  body: "\"The type alone with outline isn\u2019t obvious enough.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not
    sure it has to be that obvious. I didn't see the actual chile at first, and just
    admired the beautiful type. Noticing tha it forms a chile shape was just an added
    bonus. I think making it too obvious might ruin the emphasis on the type."
