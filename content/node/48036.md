  inappropriate post on this board.  I don't know where else to find a designer of
  such high caliber as the ones on this forum.  (If I should be posting this elsewhere,
  just let me know.)\r\n\r\nI have a great illustration/caricature that was professionally
  created.  I had it made so I could use it as part of a logo.  Problem is, I don't
  have a font to go with the illustration.  \r\n\r\nSo I need someone to give me some
  ideas on different font styles/samples that would be congruent with the \"theme\"
  of the illustration and what the company does, as well as complete the logo.  Also,
  I presume the blending of the company name with the illustration will require some
  sort of additional visual element -- maybe a colored background, screen, border,
  etc.  Basically,  I need you to take the illustration and seamlessly weld the name
  of the company to create the logo.\r\n\r\nOf course, I will pay for your services.\r\n\r\nIf
  you would like to respond to this post privately, please email me at:  naesquire@aol.com.\r\n\r\nOnce
  you respond, I will give you further details and show you the illustration.\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much.\r\n\r\nNader"
