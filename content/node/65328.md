  body: "That 'a' is the hardest part of this, and if the 1955 date on the page is
    when this was printed, we are probably looking for something that may not have
    made it into digital form.\r\n\r\nThe best I could do with what I could find so
    far was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D34%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3Dbeckmann%2520glass%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D23|Helvetica
    Compressed]]. Then I think it would need to be stretched vertically, and you might
    get sort of close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thank you bowfinpw,\r\nas you said, the \xABa\xBB is the big difference.\r\nYes,
    the date is accurate, and in regard of the overprinted colors, it most be a woodtype
    face.\r\nI know I should look in \xABAmerican Wood Type: 1828-1900\xBB or other
    reference book, but a don't have a copy.\r\nThe other thing is that this one most
    be European (it's a Swiss poster). I already check some original German specimens
    from the late 20's, and got nothing.\r\nMy first bet was Ackzidenz or Folio (we
    are 2 years before Helvetica), but none of their versions go that compressed,
    and the \xABa\xBB is always different.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas?"

    involved, either a typeface (AG Compressed) corrected or drafted from scratch.
    It could have been cut film--amberlith--used for silkscreening.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Humm, could be. \r\nI have to make further research, the two examples are
    from the same designer, Emil Ruder. He could have done a custom drawing for those
    two posters. Just to bad for me, because  I could realy like to see the rest of
    the caracters.\r\n"
