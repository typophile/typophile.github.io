body: "Hi all,\r\nWith changes at work I need a bit of advice. \r\n\r\nWe have developed
  a new product and as such have/are going to receive an equity investment. As part
  of the deal we need to set up a LTD company. Currently my  business partner and
  myself are a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP). Moving to the LTD Company we need
  to transfer our business assets across into the LLP, part of these for myself would
  be my type collection. \r\n\r\nI have no problem finding out the value of my hardware
  but I can't seem to find any value for my fonts? \r\nHow do you value fonts in a
  situation like this?\r\n\r\nI currently have the Adobe type collection (around 7
  years old) and approx  \xA31000 (at purchase price) of additional fonts.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nMartin\r\n"

  body: Hmmm... Interesting question, it would be hard to quantify as you only own
    the licences for the fonts, not the actual fonts thselves. Therefore they are
    not yours to sell on, so in reality worth nothing, apart from as a legitimate
    business expense.

  body: 'Some font licenses allow transfers. Also the hardware (printers, Macs) include
    licensed software, how would you calculate what % of a Mac Book''s depreciated
    value is in the physical components and how much is in the software Apple put
    on it? Not to mention the difficulty in quantifying the value of its magical powers. '

  body: "Thanks for the thoughts\r\nas for the transfers of license, there is no transfer
    as it is effectively just a change of name (more of a accountancy exercise). \r\ndoes
    not accurately represent the true value of an item, especially with Apple hardware,
    \r\ni.e According to my accountant my MAC Pro should be worth 1/3 its value now
    (based on depreciation over 3 years), however Ebay and secondhand site suggest
    it has only lost \xA3300 of value?  Most confusing especially when my 3 year old
    G5 recently sold for \xA3800 This leads to a problem calculating how much my font
    collection is worth>\r\n\r\n\"it would be hard to quantify as you only own the
    licences for the fonts, not the actual fonts thselves.\"\r\nThis is true but since
    I am still the licensee I simply need to know how much these are worth to the
    new company (tax reasons), are fonts worthless once bought? or do they change
    value? For instance my upgrade to CS4 has been valued by our accountant at \xA3800
    \ even though it is only valid on my one desktop?\r\n\r\nmost confusing\r\nmartin "

  body: "I don't think hardware or usual software depreciation are suitable here.
    Their depreciation rates are very high due to quick obsolescence.\r\n\r\nBut a
    font license would be used without any kind of obsolescence for many years. Just
    after a long renew in general technology one finds a font really deprecated \u2013and
    even in this case, this may be surprisingly slow.\r\n\r\nTake the Type1 transition
    to OpenType: after a decade, OT is still under adoption and T1 is still perfectly
    usable.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is from the technological point of view. In terms
    of design, culture and marketing, a new font is more valuable than a massively
    used one. But even in this case, the velocity is slower than you may find in other
    design areas. Trends in car, web or clothing design become 'old' after two or
    three years (in some case, even earlier). A font surely not.\r\n\r\nAn annual
    7% depreciation seems to be a logical rate (so you're estimating the font has
    about 14 years of usage). In accounting practice, for example, hardware/software
    are depreciated at a 20\u201330% annual rate."

  body: I consider software (and thus fonts) to be a business expense and do not depreciate
    that, but do a 100% write-off. This practice has been validated by the Dutch Tax
    Office (at least in my 20-odd years of digital design).

  body: 'Depreciation rules vary from country to country. For instance here in Canada
    the "Captial Cost Allowance" for software was recently changed so the full value
    of software could be depreciated in one year rather than over 3. However assigning
    a value for legal purposes may be different from those used for tax calculations.
    You need to consult an accountant. Usually you''d use "fair market value" (what
    you''d expect to sell it for on eBay, for instance) or "book value" (the asset
    value you have identified in your accounts). '
