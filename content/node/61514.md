  that).\r\n\r\nA famous graffiti artist, [[http://www.artrepublic.com/biographies/10-blek-le-rat.html|Blek
  Le Rat]], somehow ended up on my facebook and he joined a group that linked to this
  site called [[http://www.maquis-art.com/|Maquis Art]]. Better brush up on your [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language|Fran\xE7ais]].\r\n\r\nDespite
  the fact I'm a bit of a digit head, I have to admit I've always been fascinated
  by graffiti art, due to the fact that it's largely type-based. There's a fantastic
  documentary on the history of graffiti called [[http://www.bombit-themovie.com|Bomb
  It]]. I highly recommend.\r\n\r\n(<em>clip in top right corner</em>)"

  body: Depends on if he meant type or a type. (But a type of what? Is street art
    a type?) And lettering or not, it's still sixteen cuckoos N-by-NW even if it's
    rad.

    awesome link thanks! That guy, Cui Xianren (above image), has some amazing life
    in his strokes and character shapes as a whole. Immediately reminded me of Chaz
    Bojorquez, and then onto Retina, and then back onto some old school black letter
    'artists' - who also had such a natural talent for letter (character) shapes.
    \r\n\r\n(I won't bore the stodgy here with a long list of amazing graff writters.)\r\n\r\nOld
    and new graffiti letter shapes coming up off from the streets have a lot more
    life to them than something puked from a 'puter. Especially the stuff being crapped
    out fontstruct. Letter shapes on the street express a dynamic gesture - something
    you can't fake in font lab. It seems to me that the people laying it down on the
    street are by far more natural in their letter shape talent than most of the well
    heeled 'puter driven type designers. But the well heeled 'puter driven type designer
    is by far more - clever.\r\n\r\nAnd as for your new found friend Blek Le Rat,
    I've followed his work for some time now. It's interesting to note in today's
    auction houses the number of artist who's stuff has come up from the streets is
    dramatically increasing. \r\n\r\n"
