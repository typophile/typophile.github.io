  body: "I used to print checks on a Miehle vertical press. One of the last commercial
    uses of letterpress. The numbers and all the routing and personal information
    are printed in magnetic ink so the scanner can read them. There are two numbering
    machines, one for the bottom and one for the upper right. The rest is metal type
    from a Linotype. Of course this was 25 years ago so the technology may have changed.
    Being a pressman was fun, having a job at that place wasn't\u2026\r\npeace"
