  body: "But certainly some sort of space is gonna work better in the long run than
    none at all. Consider whether any of the notes will run to more than one line:
    are you going to do a hanging indent? If yes, that would support the space. Might
    there ever be two footnotes on one page? Asterisk & dagger aren't <em>necessarily</em>
    going to have the same width so some tab-based space would then make sense to
    line up the text of both notes. If you were doing numbered footnotes, they'd certainly
    have a space!\r\n________________________________________________\r\nEver since

  body: "> Might there ever be two footnotes on one page?\r\n\r\nI've done scholarly
    notes, with up to 20 on a page (at worst). Those would be numbered notes, however.
    \r\n\r\nFor symbol notes, there is a progression of about six symbols (asterisk,
    dagger, double dagger, section mark, paragraph mark ... ??? my mind is foggy,
    perhaps someone else will clarify.) I believe the rule is that if you pass the
    six, you start to double asterisk, etc. (But over six notes on a page and you
    really should be using numbered notes. )"

  body: I think I've seen double-vertical-bar used as the next one in the succession
    after the paragraph mark. But, yes, whoever did that should really have been numbering
    them instead...
