    Could be wrong though, they are very similar.'

    look at the time-stamps.\r\n\r\n<cite>Except the \u2019I\u2019 in the sample isn\u2019t
    curvy.</cite>\r\nLex: There\u2019s AG Schoolbook and FF Schulbuch S\xFCd which
    both have a curved \u2018I\u2019 (that is: uc eye, not lc el! \u2013 why don\u2019t
    we have a Georgia Schoolbook?!)\r\nAnd there\u2019s AG Schoolbook <strong>Two</strong>
    (or <strong>\u2018A\u2019</strong>) and FF Sb Nord, both with a straight \u2018I\u2019.\r\n\r\n<cite>It\u2019s
    AG Schoolbook. There are differences.</cite>\r\nI think Jan is right; AG Schoolbook
    <strong>Two</strong>. (Btw, this version has nothing to do with Akzidenz Grotesk)
    Then, this sample is so small \u2026 could be just another custom version of a
    Helvetica Schoolbook. "
