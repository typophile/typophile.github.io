  historical fiction novel.  Using Bickham Script for prologue, quotes at beginning
  of each chapter, and first letter of chapter alternate capitals. <BR> <BR>Question:
  Have chosen Caslon as the main book font - will be done using Quark.  We had originally
  decided to use Caslon Pro by Carol Twombly, but the designer already has Caslon
  540 in her inventory.   <BR> <BR>Is there a significant difference between Caslon
  540 and Caslon Pro?-   Would 540 be appropriate for book publishing? <BR> <BR>Thanks,
  <BR>Zoe.'

  body: I think there is. Anyway Caslon 540 is been a design standard for book publishing.
    If you want to be historical you&#39;ll need the Small Caps and Old Style figures
    fonts.

  body: 'One big difference between the two: Caslon 540 is a display face, not very
    good for text. Adobe Caslon is mainly a text face, not well suited to display
    work.'

  body: more important thing, Quark don&#39;t handle OpenType Pro fonts features...
    So just basic character set in Quark, no lovely Small caps and so on as in Indesign

  body: 'What I meant was that the available <i>digital</i> versions of Caslon 540
    are more suitable for display.  <BR> <BR>In the original metal foundry version,
    each size was different. It had optical compensation for each size so it was designed
    for text in the smaller sizes. All the digital Caslon 540s I&#39;ve ever seen
    appear to be modeled after one of the larger metal sizes. It&#39;s especially
    noticeable in the italics.  <BR> <BR>You can&#39;t really see what text looks
    like in low res screen graphics very well, but here&#39;s 10-point Caslon 540
    at about 400%: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40355.gif"
    alt="caslon540"> <BR> <BR>The top is Caslon 540 from a 1941 ATF catalog, the bottom
    one is Adobe&#39;s digital version of Caslon 540. To really see the difference,
    it&#39;s best to look at printed samples.'

  body: Just a personal observation, but Baskerville might actually &#34;jive&#34;
    better with Bickham than would Caslon. Baskerville was himself an engraver, so
    the qualities of his letters would certainly mate well with an engraved script.
    Anyway, just a thought... <BR> <BR>-Addison

  body: I&#39;m not very familiar with that version, but I have to show some preference
    for Storm&#39;s <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/jbasker.html">Baskerville</a>.
    It&#39;s very complete and available in OpenType, plus there are &#40;I think&#41;
    optical weights. I have a printed specimen and it&#39;s very nice! <BR> <BR>Storm&#39;s
    may be overkill--and in that case there&#39;s <a href="http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/baskerville1757.asp">Baskerville
    1757</a> by Lars Bergquist which is nice, but a little stiffer. <BR> <BR>Both
    of these have the great Baskerville italics. <BR> <BR>-Addison
