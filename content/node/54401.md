  for Cambria. Client is in the fashion industry. I would like it to be larger family,
  especially a 'light' weight is needed.\r\n\r\nSo far i've got:\r\n- Documenta (I'm
  not keen on the large 'ascenders')\r\n- Fedra\r\n\r\nBut I would like to hear your
  suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: As far as modern, technical looking serif typeface families go, Fedra is probably
    one of your best bets. You might also consider FF Absara or FF Meta Serif, both
    from FontShop. Try searching this site for similar threads.

    Light. Depending on the number of licenses the customer needs it might be cost-effective.
    Or it might not. '

  body: "Thanks everyone,\r\n\r\nClient decided to go with Fedra. They liked the fact
    that they had the option for certain purposes to have a Sans matching...\r\n\r\nChecked
    out Meta Serif agian btw. Beautifully done!\r\n\r\n@Sii > As for getting a light
    production: this client won't justify the costs. However your idea just found
    it's way into another proposal for another client, thanks."
