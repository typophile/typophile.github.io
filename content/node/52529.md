body: "I'm far from a font expert, but it seems like a Bodoni-type font.  I think
  I've seen many books using that font, but haven't been able to find the exact font
  that is used, there were always small differences from the Bodoni fonts I looked
  at online.  Maybe a font used by printers back then that isn't available in digital
  form?  Anyone recognizes it?\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated.  Thanks!"

  body: I think it's probably an "off" version of Bodoni Book. Back in the Seventies,
    there were a lot of cold typesetting manufactures (phototype, strike-on, etc.)
    and they each had their own versions of popular faces, each a bit different from
    everyone else's.

  body: I would agree with Mark. Fonts like that were also still around in the 80s.
