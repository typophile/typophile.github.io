  and Proportional Alternate Vertical Metrics)?

  body: "It looks like they are \"Single adjustment positioning\"\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#6.a\r\nSo
    in .fea file:\r\n<code>\r\nlookup vpalProportionalAlternateVertic {\r\n  lookupflag
    0;\r\n    pos \\A <100 100 200 -300>;\r\n} vpalProportionalAlternateVertic;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>lookup
    paltProportionalAlternateMetric {\r\n  lookupflag 0;\r\n    pos \\B <-200 -300
    0 0>;\r\n} paltProportionalAlternateMetric;\r\n</code>\r\nBTW palt is Proportional
    Alternate Widths not Halfwidths\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This should help. Below are excerpts from the 'palt' and 'vpal' GPOS features
    in our KozGoPr6N-Medium OpenType font:\r\n\r\nfeature palt {\r\n  position \\634
    <-20 0 -500 0>;\r\n  position \\638 <-250 0 -500 0>;\r\n  position \\674 <-480
    0 -500 0>;\r\n} palt;\r\n\r\nfeature vpal {\r\n  position \\638 <0 250 0 -500>;\r\n
    \ position \\7887 <0 20 0 -500>;\r\n  position \\7899 <0 480 0 -500>;\r\n} vpal;\r\n\r\nThe
    font is CID-keyed, so the glyph references are CIDs. CIDs 634, 638, and 674 correspond
    to U+3001, U+30FB, and U+FF08, respectively. These are good examples, because
    they represent a left-justified (U+3001), right-justified (U+FF08), and centered
    (U+30FB) glyph. The vertical form of CID+634 is CID+7887, and that of CID+674
    is CID+7899. CID+638 is used for both horizontal and vertical writing, because
    it is centered in the em-box.\r\n\r\nAlthough the new advance widths are 500 units,
    meaning half-width, there is no requirement that this be the case. We simply decided
    to implement them that way for this particular font."
