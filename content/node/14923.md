body: I am trying for a week now to figure out a similar typeface to the one used
  in <a href="http://www.allianz.com/Az_Cnt/az/_any/cma/contents/604000/saObj_604130_allianz_blauaufweiss_teaser.gif">
  Allianz </a> logotype. I know this one is most certainly cusom (judging by the overall
  look and by the connection to the symbol) but I was thinking there might be similar
  typefaces to it.

    goes, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=ITC.108281.0.7&attributes.sampleSize=24&sampleText=Allianz&sampleSize=32"
    target="new">ITC Quay Sans</a> is roughly similar.

  body: Actually, I need to figure out how a capital "T" should look to fit alongside
    Allianz style. Ela Demiserif is a good inspiraton, thank you.
