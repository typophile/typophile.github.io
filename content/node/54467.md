  that it hasn't but wasn't sure how to search it), but here goes.\r\n\r\nI have lots
  of fonts from lots of different sources and in lots of formats. Opentype, True Type,
  Postscript, TT, TTF, T1 gahh! Not to mention Font Suitcases...\r\n\r\nIn some cases
  I have dupes of stuff in different formats (example: Helvetica in OT, T1, TTF, PS,
  etc)\r\n\r\nAnyways I was just curious, what is the best format to be using on my
  Mac? From what I've read Opentype is the way to go, but I just wasn't sure if I
  should always go Opentype over another format (or, the best way to procede? If no
  opentype should I pick T1, no T1 pick PS, etc.)\r\n\r\nThanks so much guys."

    I figured opentype is the way to go if I can)

  body: "On current Macs, the only real no-go is PC style PostScript fonts (*.pfa
    and *.pfb; and a savvy user can convert those using FontForge, after reviewing
    the relevant EULA permissions, of course). But I agree, unless there is a compelling
    reason to do otherwise (like some program that will only use TrueType fonts, like
    Hash Animation Master), OpenType is where everything is heading.\r\n\r\nIf you're
    running legacy systems with Mac OS 9 or earlier (back as far as 6-ish with the
    right extensions), you're stuck either with PS type 1 and 3 outline fonts and
    accompanying bitmap suitcases, or resource-fork TrueType."
