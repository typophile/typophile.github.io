  typeface called \"[[centaur]]\". \r\nI've found plenty of information on him, the
  font and it's creation process.\r\nI am now in the phase where I would like to see
  some visual examples where it was used. I might be wrong but I get the impression
  that this font isn't a really common used one.\r\nI can imagine it's getting used
  on things like Movie Posters or Books, but I can't find any information on that
  or even more worse, visual examples. I've got some pictures of the Oxford Bible
  Lecture or the book \"centaur\" but would like to see some examples wich are on
  things like street signs, logos (if it was used for that), or like I mentioned before
  books or movie posters. I hope you know what I mean.\r\nCould you actually give
  me some help and perhaps provide me with some information or examples on my issue?\r\nI
  attached some digital examples of the font.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nByron"

    fiction section of a library and start looking for books that use Centaur (some
    books, especially those from Knopf list the typefaces used at the beginning or
    end of the book) and then do further research based on the publishing houses and
    their designers. '

    I'm asking...\r\nI can't look through the whole fiction section from our library
    to look for a book wich uses centaur (too time consuming), but the Idea with \"Knopf\"
    is pretty good. Thanks!\r\nAnyone else?"

    are many inexpensive such editions, or you may find one that matches your local
    library.\r\n\r\n2. American Proprietary Typefaces, by David Pankow, has an entire
    chapter on Centaur, and can be considered definitive. About $50, and well worth
    it if you're seriously interested in the field. It's also set in 14pt Monotype
    (metal) Centaur itself.\r\n\r\n3. The Dover edition of Champ Fleury, by Geoffrey
    Tory, is a fairly good reproduction of a book set in foundry Centaur, and is also
    worthwhile in and of itself. Around $30. The original 1927 edition is around $500,
    though.\r\n\r\n4. The Oxford Lectern Bible is set in a special version of Centaur
    called \"Bible Centaur\", produced by Monotype but not widely distributed. It
    has a higher x-height than the other versions. The most accessible source is the
    pamphlet, \"An Account of the Making of the Oxford Lectern Bible,\" by Bruce Rogers.\r\n\r\n5.
    It's very common on book covers, for the title (in digital form). You seriously
    can go to your local bookstore and browse, and you will find examples. Just one
    example off the top of my head: \"Bipolar Disorder\", ed. by Barbara Geller. Amazon
    has a clear screenshot of the cover.\r\n\r\nGood luck! It's a wonderful font,
    and hopefully before too long there will be a decent digital version of it.\r\n"

  body: "<i>Is there something wrong with the existing digital versions of Centaur?</i>\r\n\r\nMy
    main beef is the lack of optical scaling. When reproduced in offset printing,
    the Monotype (digital) version is way too thin and spidery at text sizes, and
    not as refined and calligraphic in display sizes. There are also some outlines
    which are kinda wonky when you look at them closely ('H'). Lastly, I also think
    having the Bible version available again would be cool.\r\n"
