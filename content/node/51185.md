body: "Bergsland Typography (Bergsland type)was originally known as NuevoDeco Typography
  founded in the early 1990s (some time) to market the fonts David Bergsland designed
  to be used in his digital publishing books. They come out of 20 years of professional
  typesetting experience in phototype before going digital in 1991. In general, they
  are designed for professional graphic design use: especially for publishing multi-page
  documents. Originally, all fonts were designed as PostScript Type 1 fonts for the
  Macintosh in Fontographer. Now they start out as 500+ character OpenType pro fonts
  done in FontLab which are later dumbed down to Type 1 & TrueType version for each
  platform.\r\n\r\n\"The goal of my fonts is to create them to work so well that the
  reader is not aware of them. I often add a hand-drawn edge to them to make them
  them more accessible to people tired of the Big Brother marketing culture.\"\r\n\r\nIn
  this age of increasing technological \"slickness\" I have purposely destructured
  the crispness at bit. As a result, they have several unusual characters. The Section
  character is always replaced by an open ballot box. The Euro symbol is always there.
  All of the fonts in the OpenType Pro version have lower case, small cap, and proportional
  lining figures.  The fonts since 2005 all have small caps, numerators, denominators,
  and more.</p><p>The major thing about my fonts is that they are designed for use
  in books and newsletters. They work very well for normal graphic design, but they
  really shine in multi-page production controlled by styles."
