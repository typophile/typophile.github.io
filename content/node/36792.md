    wear in Britain.\r\n\r\nThis is a coincidence, because just over the past few
    days I have thought of making a script font of one of the other versions I designed
    which I actually preferred.\r\n\r\nBut don't hold your breath. I can see it being
    available in maybe 4 to 5 years. I've got a lot of stuff to finish before I start
    any more.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.rapha.cc/?gclid=CKvkiYejrI4CFRqWGgod0A32Zg\">Rapha</a>\r\n\r\nNick
