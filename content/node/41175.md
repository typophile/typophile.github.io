    least if it reads in Georgia, as on my machine. The usual way is to refer to WW
    II, which I guess avoids the problem, as would a lining figure. \r\n\r\nSomething
    tells me that this is not the biggest of people's worries about that headline

  body: Yes, William got it! I meant the old-style figure next to WW... For all caps
    abbrevs please do use lining figures! (I see that on the web authors don't have
    control over the font choice, even less so on glyph choice, but then, for god's
    sake, use roman numeral II, as it _is_ commonplace for WW II.
