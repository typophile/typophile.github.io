body: This is the sans serif version of Architrave, showing in the &#34;Serif&#34;
  forum. As an experiment, I clipped the serifs and most of the bracketing off to
  see if I could develop a suitable sans-serif companion font. The result is a modulated-stroke
  sans. I&#39;m still entertaining the idea of producing a monostroke version as well.

  body: ' It&#39;s cool, but somehow the character seems to be in the serifs? Also,
    I probably wouldn&#39;t bother with a monoweight sans - we have too many of those
    already. In the same vein: don&#39;t feel too much pressure to make the family
    &#34;complete&#34; - even an italic might be a waste of time. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' How could there be too many mono-weight sans&#39;? We just need to get outside
    of our traditional view of letter-shapes. Mono-weight is where it all started,
    and continues to push the fundamental forms of our limited writing system. I say
    go for it. I like the wacky smashed circle shapes of the C and G. '
