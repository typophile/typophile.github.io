  struggling with. I have a project on the theme of typographic habits and the end
  result is to create a piece of design that communicates this to others. \r\n\r\nThe
  habit i was looking at was folding book edges and ruining them. Its something that
  annoys me when I lend friends books and so i thought to create a typeface based
  on the corner of a page fold and use this typeface to display famous quotes or maybe
  pivotal parts of a story. The letters themselves would have to be folded out letter
  by letter so that the action of folding rather than ruining the book would become
  vital to actually reading the story. \r\n\r\nSo yeah ! Any feedback would be greatly
  appreciated, im not having much help from my tutors at the mo' so any feedback would
  be welcomed, thanks\r\n\r\nMena x"
