  body: "Hi Alex,\r\n\r\njust confirming that this <em>is</em> some sort of Times
    Bold Italic; skewed and probably a little bit stretched. You say it\u2019s on
    a boat. Then, this has been isolated from a photograph? It looks sharper than
    Times, but this could be due to the fact that the outline has been \u2018eaten
    away\u2019.\r\nF\r\n\r\n[edit] Haven\u2019t seen your post before, Yves."
