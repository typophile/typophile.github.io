body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for a font called &#39;Tanek&#39; which apparently
  is a font by a French newspaper but I&#39;m not 100% sure. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t
  find the font anywhere despite numerous Google searches. <BR> <BR>Does anybody have
  the font or know of a link to a site which has it please. <BR> <BR>Thank you very
  much and I hope to hear from you. <BR> <BR>Take care, <BR> <BR>Mark
