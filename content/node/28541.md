  body: 'Version 3.x has a significant amount of new material over 2.x, including
    a new chapter on font modification (10: Grooming the Font). This new chapter,
    however, is not a "how-to," but, as with the rest of the book, comprises an overview
    of things to consider IF you are going to make adjustments/improvements to a font.'
