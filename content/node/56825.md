  and the document properties lists the font as TTE1FC5360t00. Why?"

  body: "The terminals are (admittedly not very conspicuously) rounded.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the answer! It'll help me with my font Mint as it seems  to share some elements.
    I really like it.\r\n\r\nWhy does the font get embedded with such a weird name
    sometimes? I've seen that a lot."

  body: "Actually, looking at this at this level of detail, I'm doubting it is Praxis.
    Look at the joins. In Praxis the top contour of the \"h\" join is smooth/rounded,
    in this font it is abrupt. The outer contour of the \"d\" shows similar divergences.\r\nThe
    PDF also has some knobby artifacts in the terminals of glyphs like \"e\", \"a\",
    or \"s\". Actually the \"e\" looks pretty wonky in toto. \r\n\r\nMaybe it's \"customized\"\u2026?\r\nMaybe
    it's \"almost Praxis\".\r\nThat would explain the weird name, too. Hmmz.\r\nNot
    meaning to insinuate anything evil if no evil was done\u2026"

  body: "I thought it looked slightly off too. There's something faux about the bold
    too. Sounds like a customisation then?\r\n\r\nPraxis proper seems amazingly current
    for something designed in 1977. "
