  body: ' Yes, very readable! <BR> <BR>Naming: <BR>The only thing I can think of is
    that it has something primary-school, something scripty about it &#40;although
    not too much&#41;. &#34;Primo&#34;? <BR> <BR>Forms: <BR>BTW, I like the &#34;v&#34;,
    but I think the &#34;z&#34; is really too wide. And I&#39;m not sure about the
    &#34;9&#34;. The &#34;a&#34; and &#34;i&#34; are nice, but maybe the &#34;r&#34;
    needs a pixel less on its right. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    it is one of my favourite sans fonts.
