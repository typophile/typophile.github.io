    It includes semi-sans and semi-serif weights.

  body: "There are three distinct categories here.\r\n\r\n1. Nipple fonts.\r\n2. Semi-
    and someserif- fonts.\r\n3. Flared stroke fonts. But really, a category of sans
    -- very little to do with serifs.\r\n\r\nI've done a couple of nipple fonts (thanks
    for the term Jackie, which I will now find impossible to forget!) -- Paradigm
    and Beaufort (upper), both with fairly low contrast, but a different approach
    to the quality of nipple. And the some-serifed Morphica (lower), which is in between
    sans, serif, and several other things as well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SerifSans_6552.jpg]"
