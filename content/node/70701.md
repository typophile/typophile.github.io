  are 6 fonts. I've had a go with some of the font identification tools on the net
  but they all seem to be more of 'modern' style and less like these block printed
  letters.\r\n\r\nNo.,  Location,   Guessed font\r\n1.    Lines 1&2, (Augusta BQ?)\r\n2.
  \   Lines 3&4, (Athelas bold?)\r\n3.    Lines 5&6,\r\n4.    Lines 7-10,\r\n5.    Line
  \ 11,\r\n6.    Line  12,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts-page_4969.PNG]\r\n\r\nAny
  help that you can give would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nDavid"

  body: Line 1 and 2 are different typefaces. Line 2 is Lining Devinne Extended No.
    2 in the ATF 1913 specimen book, but most likely had a different name if the type
    came from a British Foundry.
