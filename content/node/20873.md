  size.... any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (to be used on a smallish
  card holding alot of info)\r\n\r\n- any tips on pt size vs leading would also be
  very helpful\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nIsaac"

    Wide</a> at 5 pt. and found the results very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOn your leading
    question: in general I believe that pushing leading below 20% in order to use
    a large text size is usually folly."

  body: I'd like to add that I've used some of these faces at relatively large point
    sizes and the results are always very striking. The exaggerated features and awkward
    proportions give quite unexpected results.

  body: Actually, I'd be interested in compiling a list of contemporary typefaces
    that perform equally well at very small point sizes. Anybody feel like joining
    in with the fun?

  body: <a href="http://www.linotype.com/53981/vialog-family.html">Vialog</a> is still
    quite legible at 4pt. The Munich transit authority uses it for their pocket maps
    (and timetimes, too, I think). Also, the new Linotype catlog's index makes use
    of this small Vialog as well.

  body: "Gotham is super-legible small, and it is pretty new and useful.\r\nMetron
    (another transit typeface) is another highly legible one.\r\n\r\nBetween the two,
    I would say Metron can go the smallest: it has good ink traps, a pretty large
    x-height, and the counters are ovoid, so it is also a better space saver than
    Gotham. The problem, however, is that it is nowhere to be found on the Storm Type
    site, except in the 'best-sellers' list, whereupon clicking the link brings you
    to a mostly blank page with no information. I got mine with the Storm Open Library
    CD. Anyone know where to find it?"
