body: "I'm new to FontLab and have been spending a lot of time learning it. Some things
  elude me though. I have created a font and when I generated the OTF version, I got
  the following message...\r\n\r\n<strong>\"[WARNING] <MyNewFont> The feature file
  OS/2 overrides TypoAscender and TypoDescender do not sum to the font bbox size!\"
  </strong>\r\n\r\nThough the file was generated and seemed to work fine in Adobe
  InDesign, I'm not sure if this is an issue I should be concerned about.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone tell me what this means warning and how I can resolve the issue?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    board (http://forum.fontlab.com). Try doing a search under TypoAscender?\r\nBasically,
    it should be fixed. You need to make sure your vertical metrics total your UPM
    1000-2048, etc."

    send an email to FontLab tech support, but thought I would get a faster response
    here. Looks like I was right!\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: The Build section of the board is probably a better place to post such topics.
    Good luck with your fonts.
