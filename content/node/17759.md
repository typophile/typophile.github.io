  come from a place where typography is almost completely ignored and chances of getting
  exposed to it is very scarce. I dont know how it happened but these days I find
  that I am really in love with type. I never knew that so much things existed with
  simple letters.\r\n\r\nActually, I am really excited to find a place like this at
  the very beginning of my studies about type.\r\n\r\nComing to the logo, I made this
  for a software company focussing on software related to communication. They have
  made softwares for TV Channels, Governmental agencies etc.\r\n\r\nThis is not a
  redesigning. They did not have an identity till now.\r\nGuidelines given were to
  make it 'modern, simple and clear'\r\nTheir target include local clients and overseas
  clients.\r\n\r\nI have used Trajan and later found that it is so much used with
  movie titles. Is it ok to use Trajan?\r\nI could not play much with type regarding
  this logo.\r\n\r\nCIS stands for Codedvision Integrated Solutions.\r\n\r\nIn case
  I am missing something please tell me.\r\n\r\nThank you guys, in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIS_fro_Typophile.jpg]"

    up on the drama that it brings. Trajan (as you stated) is overused and overhyped
    on many movie posters in Hollywood today, and many for good reason. Trajan simply
    works. In this case, to me, it feels a little off? \r\nMaybe if you tried something
    more neutral, in the sans family. Maybe some kind of mark implying vision? If
    you are dead set on a serif with drama for a mark, dare I say Rotis? I may be
    burned at the stake for saying that. :)\r\nThe orange triangular accent isn't
    happening for me yet. Too detached visually...doesn't explain or add anything?\r\nOne
    mark (not the typeface) for inspiration could be Fuji Television's? A nice abstract
    interpretation of the eye, and its always nice to go overseas to get inspiration!
    Keep working and post progress!\r\n\r\nhttp://brandsoftheworld.com/brands/0002/4841/brand.gif"

  body: "My first concern about this is that it is very difficult to read, and easy
    to mis-read as in Code Division, you should investigate separating the two with
    colour, a large cap for V or moving your icon to the V. It strikes me that it
    doesn't really represent a software company (this might not be a drawback actually).
    As a word of warning orange is not always the best colour to reproduce from four
    colour process.\r\nTrajan, although not modern, is well proportioned; and although
    it is over-used it is mostly in the roman weight rather than the bold. You have
    kerning issues, especially in the vision bit where it looks a bit crushed, and
    the CI combination could be closed up a touch.\r\nTim"

  body: "The way its set its a very wide logo. Try making it Coded line one and Vision
    line two and add Intergrated Solutions as line three. As Tim suggested you have
    kerning issues as well.\r\n\r\nMay I suggest you go away from the computer and
    take a note pad and a pencil and just write different solutions. That way your
    not caught up in typefaces and kerning. This allows you to work on the bigger
    issues like communications and layout."

    should try keep in mind what it should tell, without anyone having to literally
