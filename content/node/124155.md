    about Papyrus isn\u2019t just the weathered look, but also the eccentric, art
    nouveau letter shapes."

  body: "Yes, the preservation of the exact shapes of Comic Sans, and the Papyrus
    trademark infringement are indeed \"of dubious legality\".\r\n\r\nHowever, if
    someone else were to draw new letter shapes that were between the hand-drawn look
    of Comic Sans and the calligraphic look of Papyrus, perhaps also applying limited
    weathering, to create, say, \"Ancient Blackboard\"... the thought of whether it
    would be \"so bad it's good\" would be amusing to contemplate.\r\n\r\nMind you,
    among all the amateur fonts on the legitimate free font sites, there may already
    be some candidates for an intermediate between Comic Sans and Papyrus.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    After looking through a vast number of typefaces, amateur and professional, I
    finally found one typeface, a professional one, that could be said to inhabit
    the area of design space that lies between Comic Sans and Papyrus.\r\n\r\nI present
    to you:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/tempus-sans-itc/|ITC Tempus
    Sans]]\r\n\r\nwith apologies to the font designer.\r\n\r\nAnd, just afterwards,
    I also turned up\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lillie/fidelma/|Fidelma]]\r\n\r\nwhich
    can also be considered an intermediate in this space.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,
    if you want an intermediate between Papyrus and Radiant, you can get\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/kenrusselldesign/wheat/|Wheat]]\r\n\r\nAlso,
    stretching a bit, possibly\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/smart-casual/|Smart
    Casual]]\r\n\r\nmight lend itself to an application where one is searching for
    something between Papyrus and Comic Sans.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/demosfen/|Demosfen]]
    combines hand-drawn with exotic, but probably doesn't really fit in the category.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    of course, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/ereshkigal/|Ereshkigal]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/fable/|Fable]] are simply alternatives
    to Papyrus, and aren't in this category, even if they do both look <em>slightly</em>
    more irregular and hand-drawn than the more strictly calligraphic Papyrus."
