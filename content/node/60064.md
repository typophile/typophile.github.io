    seem to prevent access to the fonts. Is it to provide IE with a way to load fonts

  body: "Well, I'm not entirely sure web developers are that hung up on the 'prevent
    access to the fonts' issue being a priority. Though I'd argue the font would be
    much more obfuscated via this method than @font-face as it requires a conversion
    of the font into a .js file. \r\n\r\nIn this case, the intent appears to be an
    alternative to sIFR moreso than an alternative to @font-face.\r\n\r\nI think they
    did a very nice job presenting the technology on that site. They make it fairly
    clear that it's not a solution for commercial faces (though that's not really
    a technical issue as much as it is a EULA issue) and that there are still other
    technical issues with it (primarily, as always, IE messing up things).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
