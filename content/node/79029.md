body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nDuring the designprocess of Sensato I realised I just
  couldn't decide upon which contrast to use. After some troublesome nights (I'm not
  obsessed with typedesign at all ;-P)  I decided to just make a MM file and try out
  some different contrasts. Takes a while, but worth it, I figured. Underneath shows
  the three variants I came up with, from high to low contrast. Obviously the high-contrast
  one has some troublespots (the other ones were already there) but you should be
  able to get the picture. However, I came up with the following. If I design the
  two extremes I could make the in-between using MM easily, which creates something
  like optical weights. I could name them Sensato A - C, each letter (A-C) representing
  a different contrast. I would like to know what you think of the idea and if you
  have any critique on the design itself, that is always much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,
  Jasper\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/contrast3_3749.jpg]"

  body: First thing I notice is that the high contrast looks like it has a larger
    x-height and the glyphs are wider (this is not an optical thing. The overall with
    is the same because I kept the same sidebearings), but that can all be solved
    easily. Sorry for the wide pic.

    typeface to have a display version, and I suppose one contrast in between won't
    do much harm. Offcoarse they'll be available as seperate packages so that shouldn't
    be a problem either."

  body: "\"It's not unknown for a typeface to have a display version\u2026\"\r\n\r\nwell,
    in my opinion, in that case, the display version has to distinguish itself a bit
    more from the text-one."

  body: Both? There are three. I've settled on the lower contrast. I guess it will
    always be a matter of personal preference, hence the different options. I'm currently
    working on refining the high contrast and I've increased the contrast a little
    to make the difference between the three more clear. Thanks for the comments so
    far guys. It really helped to clear my mind about this. Expect an update soon

  body: "I'm working on a four-size optical expansion of my designs (Stickley Text),
    it gives me a chance to refine the design and explore the optical effects of the
    shapes at different sizes. Yours can easily be made to do the same things based
    on the work you've done so far.\r\n\r\nThe changes are in the curvature of the
    stems and details, overall contrast, x-height, widths, and side-bearings\u2014all
    adjust as you go through the sizes from caption to display. The caption being
    more stumpy, weighty and spaced apart, the display having the most delicacy, contrast,
    and more tightly spaced (the sizes are the same in this example). Everything is
    based off the text weight (2nd down).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stf-norst_5591.png]\r\n\r\nWhen
    used together they balance out and look to have the same visual weight because
    of the changes, not in spite. This example is based on 6 pt, 10 pt, 18, pt, and
    56 pt usage.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stf-multiple_5430.png]\r\n\r\nWhen
    set at just the text weight:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stf-multiple-2_4909.png]\r\n\r\nOptical
    families take a lot of work to get all the pieces to fit over all the sizes, but
    are great if you really want the look and balance they can provide.\r\n\r\nMcs"

  body: Wow! That looks like its going to be a great typefamily when its released.
    I suppose you made the two extremes and used MM to make the in-betweens, right?
    At least thats what I would do. I think that optical weights need more refinement
    in a serif typeface. All I have to do is thin all horizontals, thicken verticals
    slightly and make the inktraps really small. I think I will just call them Sensato
    A - C as they can all be used at display sizes depending on what kind of look
    the typographer/designer wants to achieve.

  body: You could release multiple grades, like H&FJ did with [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100017|Mercury]],
    for example.  Very subtle variations in weight and contrast that allow printers
    or typesetters to have greater control over the outcome of the final product.

  body: "I uploaded an update above. The high contrast grade is now much more refined
    (Does anything look \"wrong\" to you?) and optically balanced to the low contrast
    grade. I'm working on the uppercase and will soon upload a pdf with all three
    grades. I left out the middle grade because if the two extremes are designed correctly,
    the middle grade won't need any manual refinements. Hope you like it!\r\n\r\nJasper"
