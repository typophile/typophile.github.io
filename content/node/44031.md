    Saku's foot. :-P  He may well miss Thursday night's match, but could be back after
    that.\r\n\r\nGood luck to your lot: our local junior team won their first round
    rather convincingly and are tied 1-1 in the second."

    camel racing team. But what the heck, Go Ducks! Beat your opponents soundly! We're
    behind you 14.7%!

    Finland, that's where my parents come from. K\xE4rp\xE4t have a nice logo, a stoat

    as it turns out, Pittsburgh's farm team, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, are
    in the playoffs as well (starting tonight against Hershey), and the tix are cheap.
    \ I'm thinking about taking in a playoff game as a \"distraction\" from my class.
