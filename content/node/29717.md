  draw the line between tweaking \"bearings\" (<em>the way the left/right limits of
  the character are called in FontForge, not sure it's the \"standard\" term</em>)
  and start working on the kern table.\r\n\r\nOf course there are some very obvious
  letter combinations that need it, but I'm still too unsure of my technique of placing
  characters in place and make it all look even, and all that across lowercase, uppercase,
  small-caps and the punctuation.\r\n\r\nI don't want to adjust kerning on letters
  that don't need it, which could cause problems in further development.\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure you guys have some good tips on that.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help,\r\n\r\nPierre-Luc"

    not true of all typeface designs and is most effective for a given size, and the
    decisions made on the \"common\" bearings must be correct for either upper and
    lowercase mixed or uppercase alone, but here's something: There are common bearings
    (a fine term), and uncommon bearings (I hope a fine term). Common bearings usually
    come in three pairs: the straight left and right bearings, the round l&r bearings,
    and the diagonal l&r. Uncommon bearings are like the right side of K e.g. which
    is usually between the right round bearing and the right diagonal bearing, and
    often is a unique numerical value.\r\n\r\nWe at FB generally use sample strings
    of H and O for spacing the uppercase because, among other things, their bearings
    are all common. So the K is the same as the H on one side, but the other side
    might be a compromise to space between H's and O's. Sometimes, you space it to
    work best with H, and kern it with O. sometimes, the opposite. \r\n\r\nBut our
    spacing stops and kerning starts when all the common bearings are correct, and
    all the uncommon bearings are the best compromise for a given design in a system
    that uses no kerning pairs, and then kerning pairs make the best spacing possible
    if a system uses them.\r\n"

  body: "I would just offer the general observation that I think it is more efficient
    to have the sidebearings in the best possible (i.e. \"most finished\") condition
    before doing any kerning, because after kerning has started, one will have to
    re-check all the existing kerning if the metrics subsequently change. If the font
    has a lot of glyphs, this can be pretty time-consuming and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I've never seen anyone <em>not</em> go back and change sidebearings after
    starting the kerning -- it will come to that eventually. It's just that starting
    the kerning is a powerful temptation which is worth resisting as long as possible!

  body: "One consideration: If it's likely (as Hrant implies) that the typesetting
    or layout software doesn't support kerning by default, then it's worth considering
    a different strategy for spacing (how I describe setting sidebearings). If you
    know the font will usually be used with kerning on by default, then space everything
    to work adequately between control characters, and then fix bad combinations,
    usually with negative kern values. If it's likely to be used without kerning,
    space everything between a variety of control characters: HOVTAX. I suggest this
    because you might specify tighter sidebearings (with negative values) for things
    like V and A, so that in general, combinations with them are less gappy. Some
    combinations will be tight, some loose, but none as gappy as if those glyphs were
    spaced to be kerned by default. It's a way to average out the unfortunate combinations
    over all combinations, so that a lack of kerning is not so apparent. \r\n\r\nI'd
    agree with Chris on method. I also find that usually some initial sidebearings
    need adjustment after kerning is applied. Though Hrant's suggestion takes into
    account how we can create notan more fluidly, for large character sets it does
    start to seem endless and impractical. What is inescapable is that the designer
    must know what texture or setting they are going for, even as they sketch shapes.
    There are too many factors that influence each other. "

    anyway!  :-/\r\n\r\n> for large character sets it does start to seem endless and

    I HAVE gone back to change bearings after kerning over the last 17 years since

  body: "It certainly helps to use kerning classes to group glyphs for the different
    kinds of spacing, and perhaps kerning, that may be required -- as David has indicated.
    If you consider glyphs as potential members of kerning classes, it will help you
    determine what kind of a spacing beast each one is.\r\n\r\nFor instance, you may
    decide to group f, t, and r in a \"left\" class, which will lead you to consider
    whether that is appropriate for the typeface you are working on, and it might
    be, but perhaps only at one end of the weight scale."
