body: "So, recently my version of Suitcase has been acting quite weird.  If I load
  a postscript file that contains both a regular and italic version, the regular over-rides
  the italic in the preview, but only when activated. I talked to someone at Extensis
  about it, and they haven't heard of this problem before. \r\n\r\nSo, I was wonder
  if anyone else has had this problem or not. \r\n\r\nexample, I load Rotis Sans light
  and Rotis Sans light Italic. Activate them both and look at the preview in Suitcase
  (they both look like Rotis Sans light.) But, if I de-activate Rotis Sans light,
  then the italic previews as an italic. Weird. \r\n\r\nI can still use them and they
  show up fine in any program, it's just thru the preview in Suitcase. \r\n\r\n[I
  use a PC with Suitcase 9.2 and this only occurs with Postscript fonts]"

    take couple of pages to describe it all. I can\u2019t wait for the release of
    Linotype Font Explore for PC (suppose to be coming soon...), than I\u2019ll bury
    the Suitcase for ever !!\r\n\r\nJen\r\n"

  body: There is an Extensis ad in the Feb 05 <em>How</em> magazine alluding to a
    new version of Suitcase to be released at Macworld. Maybe they're finally ready
    to catch up with FontAgent Pro and FontExplorer X.

  body: "Yeah, I saw that ad too, It looks as if they're going to combine the power
    of Suitcase with the organization of Font Reserve. \r\n\r\nI'd be interested to
    see what that Linotype Font Explore is like, a friend of mine downloaded it for
    the Mac and he's fallen in love with it. I hope it's as good if not better than
    that version. \r\n\r\nI liked alot of features about Font Explorer 2004, but it
    was almost too much stuff (and the fact that you could just drag and drop to create
    a \"shortcut\" was really retarded, that's why Suitcase is so popular, it's really
    just simplistic and easy to use.)\r\n\r\n"

    to see the announcement about the Windows beta realease (still a bit of a wait
    off, I'm afraid)."

  body: FontExplorer 2004 really has nothing to do with FontExplorer X. It wasn't
    a manager as much as a "font explorer". I don't know why Linotype chose to use
    the same name for their current effort.

  body: "Asvetic, I may have been the Extensis support person who handled your incident.
    If not, I would agree with the previous assessment; this issue is really rare.
    I didn't see anything like it in our support database. In my experience, fonts
    that fail in Suitcase also fail in the system with Suitcase disabled. In your
    case, I'm not suggesting that your font has a problem, since there is so little
    information. You could try starting Suitcase with a fresh database to see if that
    changes anything. To do so find the folder C:\\Program Files\\Extensis\\Suitcase
    9.2\\Data\\ and move it to your desktop. Then restart Suitcase and it will generate
    a new, empty database. Add the font again and test it to see if the problem persists.
    \r\n\r\nOn Windows in general, problems with Postscript fonts are less common.
    My hunch is that this is partly because Windows users have been less likely to
    modify fonts themselves. Also, since there are fewer out there, it's more likely
    that they're newer and from a major foundry. Suitcase doesn't do anything with
    the fonts internal components, so usually fonts either work or they don't. "
