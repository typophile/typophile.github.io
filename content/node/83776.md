  dont know much about that sort of typography. Any explanations/ideas for typefaces
  to use are welcome! :)\r\n\r\nSo far all Iv found is Dom Casual (seems to have been
  popular at the time), and maybe Ad Lib (Pink Panther style) and BudBird (Pink panther
  style).\r\n\r\nAny other Hanna Barbera style popular typefaces would be great. Thanks!"

    \r\n\r\n<em>\xBBBack in the prehistoric period before 2007, animated typefaces
    tended to be drawn as single stand-alone fonts. They rarely had relatives and
    scarcely had a supporting cast, causing short-sighted typesetters to seldom use
    them for much more than featherbrained frivolity. Tal Leming recognized this sad
    state of affairs and set forth to rescue animated typefaces from their improper
    pigeonhole. He plotted, planned, deliberated and developed for nearly a decade
    before Burbank was complete. The final family is a coordinated collection of 20
    fonts, hand hewn to handle tasks from big to small, wide to condensed, light to
    black and countless styles in between. Burbank is ready for anything from hyperbolic
    headlines on outdoor billboards and in major magazines to miniscule matters in
    tiny classified advertisements.\xAB</em> "
