  body: "The ID by Renko is right on.\r\n\r\nNote: This particular script has many
    similar cuts. One is known as <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?TH\">Palace
    Script</a> from Monotype. If you check the <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/similar?638\">similar
    fonts</a> area you'll find many more. Interesting how URW++ created this along
    with extremely similar versions named 'Hogarth Script' and 'Englische Schoolbook\"."
