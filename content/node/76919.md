body: "Is it a safe assumption that whenever the 'case' feature is activated, the
  text run will contain only uppercase letters? (i.e. the application will have already
  converted all lowercase letters to uppercase before calling the relevant GSUB lookups?)\r\n\r\nIOW,
  if my 'case' feature undoes the effects of 'c2sc', is it necessary for it to also
  undo the effects of 'smcp'?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n\r\nADDENDUM: Perhaps
  a question which I should be asking before the above is whether it is better practice
  to have 'case' undo the effects of 'c2sc' or to have 'c2sc' undo the effects of
  'case'. Which should take priority?\r\n\r\n"
