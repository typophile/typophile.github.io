  give more love to the sidebearings. How does everyone here start? Are there certain
  key words that guide you in tackling the varied shape combinations? Maybe I should
  focus on the core characters like o, m, b and build from there. Any tips? '

  body: "I do a quick pass with the Walter Tracy method and then start looking at
    shape problems that require changing the letters. After that I go through words
    (I have a massive preview file with strings of words for every letter) and random
    letter combinations. Once those look good on screen I move to Emil Ruder\u2019s
    word sets on paper, and then I jump to pages that rotate through chunks of the
    Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Then I start kerning (although when I did
    a revival of Eagle the letter shapes were so weird I started kerning early on).
    \r\n\r\nAfter it all looks good in English I go back and add diacritics, kern
    any weird stuff they do, and then start rechecking the Declaration in a series
    of languages. Giving special attention to Icelandic, Finnish, and Slavic languages
    is an easy way to spot letter combination that are really rare in English and
    Romance languages.\r\n\r\nOf course, I\u2019m still pretty new to this, so don\u2019t
    assume that I know what I\u2019m doing!"
