  one with the feel of 'lineto' or something about it. I found Babbage on Veer but
  I'm worried how well it would work as body copy at 8pt. I definitely don't want
  to be using Times or something along those 'traditional serif' lines but I need
  this font to fit into a fairly tight space as far as magazine page sizes are concerned.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be appreciated!"

    faces - perhaps Seria? (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/seria-sans/familytree.html)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    Neutraface is getting a lot of play lately, but I'd guess you want more x-height...\r\n\r\nThere's
    always Filosofia (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/filosofia/) and Eidetic
    Neo (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/eidetic-neo/).\r\n\r\nHope this helps,
    and I'm eager to see what other folks suggest.\r\n--Michael.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n//

    to mind. I know that Adobe's WarnockPro is well-liked. Proforma from Font Bureau
    might serve you well.  FF Avance is a quality face.\r\n\r\nHave a look at some
    of those. \r\n\r\nGood question, though. "

    we first need to discuss the idea of \"body copy\"...  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
