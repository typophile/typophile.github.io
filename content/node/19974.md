body: "See also [[Trajan]].\r\n\r\n<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Books]] : The Trajan Capitals</strong>\r\n\r\nThis
  small book is an outgrowth of the reproductions of the [[Trajan]] Capitals in Frederic
  Goudy's own [[The Alphabet and Elements of Lettering]]. In the introduction to this
  book, the author reveals his lack of enthusiasm for the drawings he did in the aforementioned
  book(s) and took the opportunity to revisit his drawings, with brief commentary.
  The text is accompanied by the letters reproduced by wood block printing in cool
  grey ink. It is set in his own Bertham type (his 100th, designed that same year)
  and dedicated to his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/37663_6743.jpg]"
