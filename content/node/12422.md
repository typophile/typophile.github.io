  Zapfino is a fine, elegant script typeface based on [[Hermann Zapf]]'s beautiful
  calligraphy. What would have on its own been a graceful and beautiful font has,
  over the years, served as a testbed for advanced typographic technologies, to the
  point that the most current implementation of Zapfino as of this writing, <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/61924/zapfinoextra-family.html\">Zapfino
  Extra Pro</a>, has achieved what seems to be limited sentience. It has an extensive,
  pan-European character set (barring Greek and Cyrillic, and with many of the diacritical
  characters drawn by [[Akira Kobayashi]] in close consultation with Zapf), each character
  form has at least four alternates to make the script flow more naturally, and it
  has an exceedingly complex set of ligatures and automatic substitutions (implemented
  by [[John Hudson]] for the [[TrueType]] version shipped with Mac OS X, and by [[Adam
  Twardoch]] for the Zapfino Extra Pro (Contextual) [[OpenType]] version available
  from Linotype). It is a challenging typeface to set and rewards experimentation.\r\n\r\nMore
  information about the various Zapfino fonts, including PDFs, can be found at the
  <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com\">Linotype's website</a> on its <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/61924/zapfinoextra-family.html\">Zapfino
