body: I&#39;m doing some process work at school, setting type. The text i&#39;m using
  is an excerpt from the Symbolist poet Stephane Mallarme. Are there any typefaces
  which are associated with the Symbolist movement? I would think nothing too humanistic,
  but then again I&#39;m a little rusty on my history. <BR> <BR>any pointers would
  be much appreciated. <BR> <BR>-christopher

  body: One approach would be to work in the style of the avant garde graphic artists
    of Mallarme&#39;s time, using the typefaces they would have used, ie what was
    usual in trade typesetting shops, mainly Numbered Moderns &#40;not Bodoni or Didot&#41;
    and Grotesques. <BR> <BR>A setting of Mallarme&#39;s &#34;Un coup de des&#34;  is
    in many graphic design history books. <BR> <BR>But by the same token, you could
    also use present day typefaces, if you associate yourself with a way of working,
    rather than particular typefaces.
