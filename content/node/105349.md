  One place I'm having difficulty is with the word \"Talks,\" specifically the way
  the foot of the k bumps into the s when spaced tightly. (Myriad Semibold with -25
  letterspacing is the base for all the wordmarks, which I've then modified.)\r\n\r\nHere
  are some attempts at resolving the k/s pair. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/talks_5292.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  one I've been leaning towards the most is the last one - I like the way the k bumps
  into the s and suggests script or a serif, but only on the bottom. I don't like
  the way the s' tail (terminal? finial??) ends above it, so I've tried a few things.
  But it's proving tricky and downright unsatisfactory:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/talks_ks0_5096.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/talks_ks1_3569.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/talks_ks2_5334.jpg]\r\n\r\nMaybe
  the top two have the most potential; although I felt that the way the k suppresses/cuts
  off the s was antithetical to the nature of the product (lectures for students).
  \r\nAny tips, possibilities or references to ks ligatures would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\nLisa"

  body: Hi, I would like to suggest you keep working on the third, I like the "connected"
    feeling of it. I don't know how it could work if you throw the ligature lower
    than the baseline, it might give you a more script feeling. It's only a suggestion
    ;)

  body: "moramedia - Took your advice and tried to extend the foot a bit:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/talks_ks4_4952.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso
    did another one that tried to play with the potential in the k/s to suggest mouth/speech
    bubble... without getting too cutesty...and without breaking Myriad too much.
    Not sure if it was successful, but it was fun.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/talks_ks5_4847.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you all think? Any suggestions/critiques would be much appreciated!"

  body: "I think the most sensible solution would be to slide the s behind the k.
    Similarly to how you did in the very top option (from the first post), but with
    a smaller gap. Then, if you look at that option, it lacks the self-consistency
    due to rounded corners that you added. I'd consider ditching them and just go
    with the original shapes (or at least changing them in a way that preserves angular
    appearance). I think tucking the s behind the k is enough to shape the wordmark.\r\n\r\n"
