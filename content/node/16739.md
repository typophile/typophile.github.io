body: "Wondering what you all think about the vertical justification option in InDesign
  -- Is it useful, would you use it when typesetting a book, and how do you find it
  affects the readability?\r\n\r\nFelici mentions vertical justification in The Complete
  Manual of Typography as a way to compensate for extra space left when fixing widows
  and orphans, but \"The disadvantage to vertical justification of any kind is that
  it throws the text off any baseline grid in use.\"\r\n\r\nOpinions and insight would
  be helpful!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nKristina\r\n\r\n"

    adverts with only one column of text, to fill in that extra space at the bottom
    (Clients for some reason seem to want every inch of space used up!)\r\n\r\nWhen
    setting books, brochures or anything else with more than one page I've found that
    for consistancy purposes sticking to the baseline is preferable. \r\n\r\nGiven
    the choice (as opposed to client directive) I'd possibly never use it.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    this help you in some small way\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nShaun"

    I've realized they suggest going a line short or a line long on the spread. This
    is what I'll do.\r\n\r\nKristina"
