  body: "A Typecon pint says that no mainstream review* (except maybe Gruber) even
    mentions the sub-standard typography. In fact I think the opposite will be true
    (if not already) - the reviews will say the ebook experience is great - it's a
    Kindle killer. :-)\r\n\r\nCheers, Si\r\n\r\n*not related to the Apple-halo effect
    , they don't mention it for any ebook product.\r\n"
