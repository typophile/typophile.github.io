  this is my first post.\r\n\r\nI have an Urdu book, the back cover of which has some
  lines of text set in a peculiar nastaleeq font (see the image below). I remember
  when I was a kid (early 90's), I used to read a children's magazine that also utilized
  this font for typesetting its stories. Reading around the Web (and the Typophile
  forums), I have come to believe that this font may be Linotype Qalmi, the font designed
  by Tim Holloway.\r\n\r\nCan any of you confirm if my guess is correct? If not, can
  anyone identify which font this really is?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/awaz-e-dost-back-cover_6624.jpg]"

  body: I think it might be Qalmi. I'll bring this to the attention of Fiona Ross,
    who worked with Tim on the design. She should be able to confirm whether this
    is Qalmi or something else.

  body: My apologies for the delayed follow-up on this question. I saw Fiona in the
    UK recently, and she gave me specimens of two closely related Linotype nastaliq
    designs, Sheeraz and Qalmi, both designed by Tim Holloway. Having compared these
    specimens to the image you posted, I am able to determine that the type on the
    back cover of your book is Linotype Sheeraz. Linotype Qalmi, which was released
    a few years later, was created in response to feedback on Sheeraz provided by
    Urdu newspaper publishers. Qalmi has a slightly less steep lettergroup angle,
    and stronger hairlines with less overall stroke contrast.

  body: "Thanks again, John. I had completely ignored Sheeraz while taking my guess.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, if it's not too much trouble, could you post the specimens that Fiona
    Ross gave you? After years of seeing Noori Nastaleeq virtually everywhere (at
    least here in Pakistan), I find Tim Holloway's designs very refreshing. (Even
    the book that sports Sheeraz on its back cover is otherwise set in Noori.) For
    me personally, it would be very interesting to compare Noori with Qalmi and Sheeraz,
    and learn about the intricacies of overall nastaliq type design."

    of Tim Holloway? what date they are completed? it seems they are very different
    work from what I've seen from him."

  body: Yes, these are definitely by Tim Holloway, working closely with Fiona Ross,
    then at Linotype-Paul in the UK. Sheeraz was published in 1987 and Qalmi in 1994.
    I also have a copy of the patent documentation for Linotype's nastaliq layout
    mechanism, the originals of which are now in the non-Latin archive at the University
    of Reading, along with Tim's original drawings.
