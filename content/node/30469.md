  body: "These look like they might be alternates of Avant Garde Gothic, or hand-lettered
    variations of the same.\r\n\r\nYou'll find very similar forms to these in ITC
    Serif Gothic also, although they have tiny glyphic serifs.\r\n\r\nDavid Thometz"

  body: "There is (was) a lot of hand work on that particular piece.\r\nIn fact, if
    that was a piece for the United Nations in 1970, chances are that Lubalin, Rondthaler
    or Burns had a hand in it. In any event, it was not difficult to create and modify
    one-offs, in fact, quite easy for the likes of Tom Carnase and Tony DiSpigna:\r\n\r\n<em>About
    1969, designer Roger Ferriter and letterer Tom Carnase devised\r\na wordmark for
    a line of hosiery to be called L&#8217;eggs. The same\r\nexpressive quality in
    that mark appeared in Carnase&#8217;s titling face\r\nBusorama, a spinoff from
    a bus advertising promotion. Both Carnase and\r\nfellow lettering designer Tony
    DiSpigna became known for their\r\nexuberant scripts.</em>\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://stbride.org/friends/conference/hiddentypography/phototype.html\"
