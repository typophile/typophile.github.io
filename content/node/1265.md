    true - in Canada and the US, copyright exists the moment the work has been produced

  body: '&#40;moved from Creative Squeeze thread&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; But it becomes
    your trademark simply by your using it.  <BR> <BR>Really. Since when. Not in the
    legal sense, not in the United States. <BR> <BR>If that were the case, Hrant would
    have a trademark on Helvomita. <BR> <BR>A work  is &#34;copyrighted&#34; when
    it&#39;s published&#42; or seen by a third party.  <BR>But a trademark is different.
    <BR> <BR>In a TM dispute, simply USING a mark first isn&#39;t enough.  <BR>FIRST
    to FILE is also important if you want to use your  <BR>mark outside of a limited
    geographic area. <BR> <BR>I agree that TMs typically destract... <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;You
    can register it if you want to, but there isn&#39;t much point unless <BR>you&#39;re
    a multi-million-dollar brand name. <BR> <BR>Partially disagree. If Scott wants
    to ensure that nobody gets the name, <BR>now or in the future, not only does he
    need to be First to Use <BR>but First to File. <BR> <BR>If someone independently
    comes up with Creative Squeeze and <BR>files a federal trademark &#40;and it goes
    through the process, <BR>including being Published for Opposition&#41; <BR>then
    it will impede Scott from getting &#34;national&#34; with his mark. <BR>He will
    have to stay regional and may <BR>get a Cease and Desist from the other Creative
    Squeeze that&#39;ll <BR>cost a lot more than $335 to handle. <BR> <BR>In my opinion.
    <BR> <BR>Hrant, you can file all kinds of city, county and state stuff but <BR><a
    href="http://www.uspto.gov" target="_blank">www.uspto.gov</a> is the place to
    go to file a national trademark. <BR> <BR>If your trade channels don&#39;t extend
    beyond your state, then <BR>it probably isn&#39;t necessary. <BR> <BR>These are
    opinions, btw, based on my own dealing with this <BR>stuff. However, I&#39;d check
    with a competent attorney. <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: I&#39;d agree with David on the copyright issue. <BR> <BR>I work in the apparel
    industry, where knockoff artists linger <BR>at every corner, so we&#39;ve had
    quite a bit of experience, <BR>unfortunately, in this area. <BR> <BR>For example,
    Emigre&#39;s &#34;Design is a Good Idea&#34; T-shirt, set in <BR>Base 10 or whatever,
    is Not Copyrightable. <BR> <BR>bj
