  doing a package design project for the academy of art in san francisco where I need
  to expand upon an existing clothing brand (i chose american apparel) and create
  packaging for the extension of the brand. \r\n\r\nSO basically, what I need to do
  is attach the word \"Shoes\" to the american apparel logo and for some reason I
  cant match it exactly...can anybody help me out with this???"

  body: Helevetica Neue 85 Heavy - kerned tighter (probably -25 in Illustrator and
    youll have to play with it). I used the EPS and used 72 pt size and it looks pretty
    close.
