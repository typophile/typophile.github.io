  the Euro. Articles come in, in MS word format, are proof read, edited and then transferred
  over to me. In the process the file goes from windows to OS9. From word to quark.
  I lose all my euro symbols. At the momment I have to manually replace every symbol,
  and as a result some get missed and the paper obviously suffers. Are there any simple
  ways to stop this. I suspect it maybe that the version of Frutiger I&#39;m running
  does not contain a symbol. I could manually add one in fontographer, but a little
  unsure. '

    a scan, just to humor us. <BR> <BR>As far as adding a Euro, what does your Frutiger
    license say? Current versions of Frutiger contain a Euro. Single weights are only

  body: Anonymity can sometimes be useful &#40;like in my submissions to the t-shirt
    contest...&#41;, but very often it can be a barrier to the establishment of a
    real, contextual community. I&#39;m not exactly sure why I care, in this case.
    In terms of gut feeling, it&#39;s just not honest. When you use a forum so clearly
    for your own benefit, it&#39;s only right to present yourself as who you are.
    A community benefits from mutual trust and humility, otherwise it&#39;s a dark
    alley where shady deals are made. <BR> <BR>The impression I get here is that the
    person doesn&#39;t want to appear not to know how to fix the problem. If this
    is true, it&#39;s the type of insecure manipulation I myself wouldn&#39;t want
    to encourage. On the other hand, this could very well be a mistaken impression
    - but it couldn&#39;t have happened without the anonymous presentation. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s
    make Typophile -or anything else we care about- a reflection of our personal ideals.
    That is community. <BR> <BR>hhp

    TARGET="_blank">this page</A>&#41;: <BR> <BR>&#34;Another problem is the Euro
    currency symbol. In most of the new Macintosh fonts the general currency symbol
    has been replaced by the Euro symbol and in most of the new Windows fonts a formerly

    for the Euro symbol: 20AC hexadecimal, which is the same as 8364 decimal.&#34;

    to grow up with the Internet &#40;most college students&#41; is used to using
    a nickname online. <BR> <BR>For someone young who will probably be using the net
    for the rest of their work and personal life, it makes sense to separate identites
    online. Could you imagine a future employer, spouse, social &#40;or professional&#41;
    enemy, etc. being able to find every little scrap of writing you&#39;d done over
    the last twenty years by searching for your name? People have been using net in
    volume for long enough for this already to be a problem. I&#39;ve read about a
    corporate employee that was fired because of a posting he made five years previous
    regarding his personal life. &#40;Sorry, I don&#39;t remember enough to find the
    news story.&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been lurking here for about six months and
    haven&#39;t signed up because I rarely feel the need to post. &#40;Hi, all.&#41;
    I&#39;ll never use my last name here because I don&#39;t want to leave a paper-trail
    because of this general principle. I&#39;ve known people who have had problems
    with Internet stalkers. The &#34;Observer&#34; likely has nothing to hide, but
    feels uncomfortable giving out real-life info to a bunch of strangers.'

    Its seems to have worked and since we dont print any German we shouldn&#39;t run
    into many problems.  <BR>The legal issue does annoy me a little but I apologise.
    I don&#39;t see the point in buying a new font for one character, thats not commercialy

    have solved my problem because the keyboard equilivents don&#39;t match. <BR>Apple
    Euro= shift Alt 2 <BR>but when you convert the Windows command you get the Apple
