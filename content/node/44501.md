body: Hi, I'm just starting my final major project in my art and design course at
  college and I'm at a blank for ideas. Everyones work is gong to be put up for exhibition
  in a few months time and I would really like to do something that is eye catching
  and interesting even to people that don't really have an interest in typography.
  If anybody could give me some ideas it would be greatly appreciated as I'm really
  struggling and I've got to send off a statement of intent in a few days. Thankyou
  in advance to anyone that replies.

    you could work on existing, well known, but poor examples of typography and improve
    them.\r\n\r\nThis would serve to both to be interesting in it's own right and
    to be accessible to non-typographers as they would have a point of reference from
    which to start."

  body: "sorry I dont think I explained myself properly. In reply to kidcranium, I
    am interested in typography but I'm doing an art and design course, so people
    who look at the work wont neccesarily have an interest in typography. Also I'm
    looking for a project that uses type, a poster for instance, or making pictures
    with type, more along the graphic design\\text art idea but im struggling for
    a subject matter.Heres some links and images of pieces I've found interesting(all
    from deviant art users) but I think I've been looking at so many mages my brains
    mashed. \r\n http://sugasuga42.deviantart.com/art/Say-it-While-You-Can-75084237\r\nhttp://treekin.deviantart.com/art/Taonga-Something-Precious-52010683\r\nhttp://outrospective.deviantart.com/art/cynical-33644232\r\nhttp://mistie.deviantart.com/art/Angels-of-the-dark-57568392\r\nhttp://jazzbass26.deviantart.com/art/typography-II-49426352[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bloody_type_by_tasteofpain_4051.jpg]

  body: Start with something that is personally interesting to you. What are your
    hobbies? Other things do you enjoy? Music, books, films... Don't look for inspiration
    in these images... you should start with the subject matter, that will dictate
    the form your project takes.

  body: "Tatemze,\r\n\r\nDon't listen to what your teacher says, because obviously
    he hasn't a clue. Your subject matter will ultimately determine what your design
    becomes. \r\n\r\nYou'll find inspiration in the most unlikely places. Take a walk
    and observe your surroundings, look to literature, go to the library and read
    up on a subject unrelated to typography or design. Look at images of nebulas,
    sports cars and architecture. All of these things can create a spark that may
    lead your imagination in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIs there a message you want
    to convey? Something you feel strongly about? Start with politics perhaps, after
    all, don't students always have some sort of opinion or cause they want to fight
    for? ;)\r\n\r\nBegin with a strong statement that you can use as your foundation
    [typographically as well as conceptually] and it may help you focus on where you'll
    want to start your search for inspiration. "

  body: Tat, I agree with the others, your professor is clearly inept if he wants
    you to focus on design before choosing a subject. Pick your subject and just manipulate
    your teacher into going along.

    or a refrigerator or a horse. You could illustrate, talk, photograph, etc. this
    subject in \"100 styles\". You decide on one and get deep with this style. Show
    how you can transform your pseudo-object  to this certain style you've choosen
    (do you know what i'm trying to say?).\r\nSay you go the russian constructivist
    way, get informed about the original stuff /its history, the followers/new interpreters
    and what can come out now of this \"genre and your orange\" from your own skills.

    you would like to do a poster of some kind. I know in london, and all over the
    world there is a big problem at the moment with people carrying weapons to course
    harm to others. How about an Ad campaign to stop people carrying weapons.\r\n\r\nYou
    could play on typographic treatment. In a real sense your design could save life's,
    and of course will be good for the old portfolio to show that you have addressed
    real life issue through design."
