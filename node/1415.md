  body: 'Hi Hernan. I&#39;m extremely busy these days, but I really  <BR>need new
    stationary and business cards, and a personal  <BR>website would be nice too.
    Would you want to design  <BR>those for me? For free? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"
    border=0> <BR> <BR>Behind every beautiful typeface there is a person.  <BR>Mark
    van Bronkhurst, who designed ITC Conduit in 1997,  <BR>depends on the sales of
    his work &#40;the types he designs&#41;  <BR>for an income. I don&#39;t think
    he&#39;d appreciate it if the  <BR>fruit of his labour &#40;and believe me: it
    takes a <i>LOT</i> of  <BR>time, work and dedication to design a succesful typeface&#41;  <BR>was
    given away for free, just as you wouldn&#39;t like  <BR>it if the logos you design
    were not paid for. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t want to sound preachy, but this is the
    third  <BR>request for font piracy in a week on &#34;our&#34; board,  <BR>and
    I don&#39;t think I really like this evolution. It&#39;s  <BR>like going to a
    jewelers&#39; convention and ask where  <BR>you could steal some jewelry. Get
    the picture? <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Yves, I check out the forums at My Fonts and you would not believe how many
    people get angry they have to pay for a font. As my local public radio station
    &#40;WBGO&#41; during a fund drive says, when you leave the grocery store you
    can&#39;t just say to the casheer that the guy behind me will pay for my groceries.
    It amazes me! Bither way, less than 1% of listeners to my public radio station
    are members. Dan

    I hope they will understand better when they  <BR>realize they&#39;re ripping
    off some guy, a designer like  <BR>themselves, not just a faceless company.

  body: Yves, I see your approach, my public radio station is one of the few remaining
    Jazz radio stations in the USA. They have a website with streaming for listeners
    from throughout the world. I love that station. But the point is If I love a design
    in type I&#39;m happy to support the artist that created it. I bought Dalliance
    because of its beauty &#40;to me&#41;, and I&#39;m thinking of buying Tarzana
    as well. Dan

    <BR>Actually, I&#39;m trying to come up with something constructive  <BR>that
    addresses this &#39;problem&#39;. Gimme a couple of days.

    not as big of a fan of WGBH.'

  body: Colin listen to WBGO online, they have it streaming online. Its wbgo.org.
    But wait until October 1 because they are in the last days of fund raising and
    they get really desperate near the end. I wish most of the listeners were like
    me and gave re-uped the first hour of the first day. I really enjoy the Blues
    hour. Dan

  body: 'At least he asked politely! I am totally with Yves  - good post. There are
    folks posting these same questions to MyFonts.com all the time. I work at a place
    that sells typefaces and we often get that response: &#34;HOW much!!??&#34; like
    it&#39;s a big shock when you tell them the cost. I think people &#40;especially
    those of a certain age brought up on the wonders of the internet&#41; expect a
    free ride too often. The trouble is, they will probably find Conduit for free
    on some dodgy freeware site. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: I think something that adds to the problem are these &#34;free font&#34; sites
    who make it look like &#42;all&#42; fonts  on their site are free and then try
    to add the charge last minute.  Very misleading and sure to upset potential customers.

  body: Paul do you work for MyFonts? If you do your Internet Provider is killing
    the Forums. 3/4 of the time now there is no posting just an error message. I like
    the forums because I learn things by exchanging ideas, but MyFonts forums are
    unusable right now. Dan
