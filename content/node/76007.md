  still with some of the font... \r\n\r\nI know the T and the M are Vivaldi. But the
  rest have got to be something different because the cuts in vivaldi are way to off...
  The closest i could get to with the second half is Elysium Italic... But it still
  doesn't cut it. Does anyone know the exact font? or possibly a closer one? \r\nThanks\r\nKenny "
