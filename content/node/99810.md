  body: "I was given a word document with the typesetting on it and I was told it
    was Nanum Myeongjo, which I can find on my Mac, but ... in Word and (more importantly)
    InDesign, neither recognise the font and tell me it is a Korean font?\r\n\r\nThey
    display it in English if I choose English, but whilst some letters are similar
    and some seem to be the same, some are very wrong (e.g. 'S') and the formatting
    is completely wrong... meaning different vertical and horizontal scaling of letters
    next to each other and much 'bolder' looking and the kerning and tracking much
    narrower.\r\n\r\nI am confused and thought my computer maybe defaulting to something
    like Cambria in some sort of modified form. "

  body: does InDesign not recognize the font, or is it listed waaaaay at the bottom
    with the other foreign language/system weirdities?

  body: "Well, as a Korean language font, it is a \"foreign language/system weirdity\"...
    is that how they're sorted? It just happens to have a Roman typeface you like.
    Happens all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: i can't give a screen snap at the moment but yeah, all the chinese character
    fonts are at the bottom of the font list. there are all the "normal" fonts, then
    seems like a divider line, and then those. they're all named strangely but do
    contain some roman characters. i believe they're installed with InDesign or in
    the Mac OS because I certainly never added them  :)
