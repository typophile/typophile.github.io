  I am looking for the \u2018Canada\u2019 and \u2018at the market\u2019 font. I have
  tried the font matcher on this site, the \u2018Match Font\u2019 tool in photoshop,
  and extracting the font name in the \u2018properties\u2019 when I open a pdf of
  the file in Adobe Acrobat. All versions of the file I have, the font has been converted
  to outlines.\r\n\r\nAny other tips or tricks? This logo would have been designed
  around 2009. Trying to find out who designed it, but corporate memory is a bit lacking."
