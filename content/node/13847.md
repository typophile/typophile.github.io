  body: "Enrico, Mr. Solo is such a lovely man, and his presentation was wonderful.
    He is considering writing a book on the subject, and asked us not to publish his
    presentation in any form. I'm sure some people took notes, bu we should check
    with him and see what his plans are before making public any part of his presentation.\r\n\r\nI
    look forward to seeing this in print!"
