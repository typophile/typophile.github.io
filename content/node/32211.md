body: "Hello from SXSW Interactive! This morning I attended a panel discussion entitled
  <em>Web Typography Sucks</em> hosted by <a href=\"http://www.markboulton.co.uk/\">Mark
  Boulton</a> and <a href=\"http://clearleft.com/\">Richard Rutter</a>. The panel
  delved into some of what plagues typography on the web and offered some insights
  about what can be done to correct the most common offenses.<!--break--> Topics covered
  included:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Creating a vertical typographic rhythm</li>\r\n<li>Building
  em based grid structures</li>\r\n<li>Web friendly typeface selection</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAdmittedly,
  many of these ideas have been presented before. However, Mark and Richard are doing
  a great job of packaging everything together for an audience that may not otherwise
  know the names Tsichold or Bringhurst. For those interested, slides from the presentation
  and additional resources can be <a href=\"http://webtypography.net/sxsw2007/\">found
  here</a>."

    design particularly interesting. Although I have read all of M. Boulton's articles
    on grid design for the web, I still didn't have a clue how to do it properly.
    The way it is represented in the slides, with the notes, is so much easier to
    understand.\r\n\r\nI hope you are having a good time down at SxSW!"

  body: "Good stuff-- I'm linking it all up for my students.\r\n\r\nOne thing I notice
    about these kinds of discussions, though-- where is the push for truly high resolution
    monitors? I got a laser printer for $69 that'll do 600 x 1200, while my snazzy
    19-inch flat screen remains stuck at less than 100 ppi in real measurements. Even
    so-called \"ultra high pixel density monitors\" like <a href=\"http://www.viewsonic.com/support/desktopdisplays/lcddisplays/proseries/vp2290b/\">this
    one</a> are barely more than <strong>200</strong> ppi and cost, in this case,
    <strong>$6000</strong> (100 times as much as my printer?!).\r\n\r\nI appreciate
    all the general design ingenuity that this presentaiton offers. It's very good,
    useful stuff. But I think that ultimately the \"look and feel\" of on-screen typography
    will never rival print until the resolution issue is addressed on a big scale.
    In a way, it's kind of like dealing with printouts that never get any better than
    what you'd get from an NOS dot-matrix printer."

    body: ">Try printing out every Web page you visit instead of viewing it on screen,

      but I don't print them out. I read them on the screen. I print some out, yeah.
      What I'm thinking of is simply print resolution-- in, you know, books and magazines
      and stuff-- versus screen resulution. If I really wanted to save money, I'd
      have neither a screen nor a printer. I'd use my local library more.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
      luminosity seems to be the screen's chief advantage. And the associated blending
      of colors of light that make photographic material look pretty decent at low
      resolutions (which has the analogy in the 150 dpi color inkjet printout, which
      can look ok for a lot of photos on glossy paper). But this is getting more and
      more off-topic. Sorry.\r\n\r\n- J"

    in general. Perhaps better titled as \"Default typography settings in most software
    sucks\".\r\n\r\nAs for the em-based grids, it's a valid approach, but does have
    pros and cons just like any other approaches."

  body: "jlg4104...that is one of the main complaints that Tufte has. I agree. Every
    aspect of computing as increased 1000+% (ram, disk storage, speed, size) except
    monitor resolutions. The standard resolution increase on most monitors in that
    past 25 years as increased what...25% at best?\r\n\r\nRelated to that, is the
    lack of resolution independant screen rendering. Eventually, we will have more
    control over on-screen rendering when we can specify sizes in real measurments
    like an inch and have it display as an inch regardless of the screen resolution."
