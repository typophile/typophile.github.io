  and have noticed what strikes me as an oddity but perhaps I am mistaken here.\r\n\r\nUsing
  Russian as an example, the regular styles of the fonts I've looked at all include
  '\u041E\u0431\u044B\u0447\u043D\u044B\u0439' (or in a few cases '\u041F\u0440\u044F\u043C\u043E\u0439')
  as a localized style name. This, however, appears to be invariant across faces.
  Shouldn't the style name agree in gender with the font name? Or is the style name
  considered a noun rather than an adjective?\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
