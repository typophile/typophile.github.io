body: "so i love things made out of paper, particularly since it can be such a fragile
  medium in some scenarios. combined with my interest in typography, i have to spotlight
  2 sites i've run into recently:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Everything5_5139.jpg]\r\nThis
  was done by Dutch artist Zelda Beauchampet, and the rest of the project that goes
  with it can be seen [[http://www.zlda.nl/everything.html|here]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/yulia_4446.JPG]\r\nTo
  me, this is amazingly beautiful, as is her [[http://www.artyulia.com/|other works]].
  The Marian Bantjes of paper? To me at least."
