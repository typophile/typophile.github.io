body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI am attaching an image that shows a comparison between a phrase
  set in Adobe Garamond, Miller Text, and Baskerville.\r\nI love the look of Baskerville,
  and would like to use it for a project I'm about to start, but I'm bothered by the
  inconsistency of the widest strokes in the uppercase characters vs. the widest strokes
  of the lowercase letters. The uppercase letters are heavier, and they seem to interrupt
  the rhythm of the sentence. It's more obvious in longer settings with more lines.\r\n\r\nThe
  Garamond and the Miller, in contrast, look much more consistent to me and establish
  a more cohesive, unified type color as a result. \r\n\r\nI've noticed this inconsistency
  in other faces also, such as Caslon and Century. Is this considered \"bad?\" Is
  it something that used to be considered okay but has now fallen out of favor? Do
  type designers try to avoid this kind of inconsistency when drawing a face today?
  In addition to the issue of choosing a face for my current project, I'm interested
  to know what the type design community thinks of this.\r\n\r\nI know Baskerville
  and Caslon are considered \"classics,\" but this unevenness does bother me. Do you
  think it's so slight that it's not worth considering?\r\n\r\nThanks for any thoughts
  you have,\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Stroke_Width_6294.jpg]"

    lines.\"\r\n...and at larger sizes than at smaller sizes. The weight difference
    is made to take up the additional space of the larger uppercase glyph at smaller
    sizes, as traditional optics demand. This is not considered bad. It used to be
    required. Many faces drawn today are drawn to suit larger settings, and have smaller
    differences. Classic sometimes can mean something that has not been revived fully.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
