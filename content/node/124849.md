  body: "Looks like Erich Meyer's Tannenberg of 1935 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/TannenbergFetteasCursed_4373.jpg]\r\nThere
    is a digital Tannenberg Fett widely available as a Dieter Steffmann font, but
    I suspect it is a rip of a digital font created by another fontmaker. There are
    original digitizations of all Tannenberg weights by Gerhard Helzel http://www.fraktur.biz/
    Complicated website. Fonts by direct sale only.\r\nDon"
