  is really started to bother me. The g is a relaxing italic, while the a is stuffy
  lowercase roman.\r\n\r\nCould you please suggest a font that has an italic alphabet,
  sits upright, and has serifs. To be a little more demanding, a slanted texture would
  be interesting as I have not seen that on an upright typeface :)\r\n\r\nThank you
  so much!!"

  body: "Well, I may have used outmoded (and misleading) vocabulary because I have
    recently read Gill's 1931 Essay on Typography and I am still learning. Gill recognised
    only three alphabets: roman, roman lowercase, italic. His meaning of italic may
    be equivalent to contemporary cursive.\r\n\r\nIf I am permitted to give the fonts
    a personality: Perhaps I am aiming for cursive and vertical - as though the words
    are to be perceived as flexible and upholding. I reject roman typefaces because
    I associate them with inflexible content, such as the words of a printed book.
    I quite like Minion, for example, but it has that entrenched roman quality that
    does not suit my aim.\r\n\r\nStone comes really close to my aim and the only thing
    I mark it down on is for being rather bubbly and playful - its as though the typeface
    does not take content seriously. This is due to its large x-height and wide ems
    (although I do not yet fully understand the em unit).\r\n\r\nThe only thing that
    caused me to reject Rotis Semi Serif is its mixing of roman and cursive glyphs
    - its as though the typeface cannot make up its mind. My contrasting font is Rotis
    Semi Sans, which shares the same fault. So I am really looking for cursive vertical
    replacement of the Rotis family.\r\n\r\nI may need to print off samples because
    I have observed that fonts look different on screen. Consequently, Stone is still
    in the running :)"

  body: "Well, kentlew, I'm going to try Mirarae and see how it looks on a page. I'm
    not currently very confident about the serifs on descenders. I have realised that
    nearly all typefaces look sweet in small samples and its only when you see them
    in blocks on a grid that they expose weaknesses. Those sites don't make it easy
    to trial fonts - do they have a refund option? :))\r\n\r\nBendy, it has crossed
    my mind but I do not want to make an ignorant typographic blunder. I am at the
    stage where I understand how to read typefaces, but perhaps not ready to make
    them. For example, if I drop cursive a and g into Minion, anyone who recognises
    the base font is going to immediately identify the customisation and critique
    it. I might not be ready for that :)\r\n\r\nMay I ask, why did you refer to Rotis
    as pretentious? I do not disagree, I'm just curious to understand your meaning.
    For example, I see that the e descends below the line and it has other curious
    qualities. I think it would be interesting to read the creator's rationale."

  body: "Aah, in my experience type designers are a helpful bunch. I'm sure some would
    be happy to customise their work, for a fee, it's worth asking at least. \r\n\r\nAnother
    option would be to look at the glyphs and see if the fonts contain phonetic letters,
    where you could find cursive variants.\r\n\r\nPretentious...the semiserif version
    at least pokes me in the eye with its 'too cool for school' self-conscious c and
    e. And the mechanical mix of serif and sans forms seems to combine the worst of
    both worlds. An interesting and deliberate but rather unsatisfying lack of unity.
    I once had to read a whole book in Rotis semiserif. "

    visual intrigue that wears poorly in comparison to Minion, Times, etc. However,
    I wonder if that intrigue is not a gimmick, and if a careful redesign could result
    in a new classic. In other words, I suggest there might be a good idea that has
    yet to be well implemented."
