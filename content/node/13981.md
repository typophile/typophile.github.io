  target=\"new\"><strong>design in four weights</strong></a>.\r\n(The repro is less
  than optimal.)\r\n\r\nMy question is do you recognize the face, and if so was it
  ever released?\r\nI actually know something about its origin and designer, but I've
  wondered for a long time if it ever made it off the board.\r\n\r\nThis is not a
  test, nor is it a trick or puzzle... just a straight forward question if you recognize
  the typeface.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Norbert, Wild shot. Was the design illustrated part of the designs submitted
    for the Barcelona Olympics. It does have a Benguiat flair to it.

  body: "Hi Joffre,\r\n\r\nyes, it was one of Ed Benguiat's many designs that he kept
    in his famous <em>drawer of sketches</em> to develop at some point. I selected
    this one for Ed to expand so we could present to the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympic
    Games design committee.\r\n\r\nIt was to become the \"official\" typeface for
    that Olympiad, and it's working name was <em>Catalana</em>. Once Kodak found out
    that Agfa was involved, they strong-armed the committee to shut us out based on
    their sponsorship of being the ONLY film based company associated with the 1992
    Games.\r\n\r\nAll I know is that Ed put it back in his drawer and haven't found
    out if it was ever finished and released under another name.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"
