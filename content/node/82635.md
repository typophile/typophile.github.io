body: "My first reaction to seeing a book called Letter Fontein in the bookshop of
  the Graphic Design Museum in Breda on a study trip in February was to wonder when
  it might become available in English. It\u2019s a reflection of the world we now
  live in that the book in question, printed in China by a German publisher, but authored
  and designed by a Dutchman, is available in my own language (and Spanish, French
  and German), a mere ten or twelve  weeks later...\r\n\r\nTaschen offer a flick-through
  preview on their website at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/design/all/06770/facts.letter_fountain.htm\r\n\r\nYou
  can see bigger previews and find out more about the Dutch edition at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.letterfontein.nl/\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "So Hrant did you see a copy already?\r\n\r\nSome time last year Joep Pohlen
    put the text of the first 200 or so pages online at <a href='www.letterfountain.com'>www.letterfountain.com</a>.
    Also some tasty downloadable teaching resources (pdf).\r\n\r\n"

    think I read your original post in haste.\r\nThe price isn't bad either...\r\n\r\n>
    a mere ten or twelve weeks later...\r\n\r\nI just hope they didn't use Google
    Translate,\r\nas much \"entertainment\" as that would offer.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
