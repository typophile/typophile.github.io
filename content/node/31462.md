  body: 'Well, oddly enough, it IS available on the web for free, although it says
    it''s only "free for personal use". Maybe that happened before Font Bros revived
    Fontalicious, and now that it''s available again this free listing should be removed?
    I''m not quite sure how it works. '

  body: But then the M is an upside W, so what's that meant to be? A double-N? The
    M makes me think of the ghosts from PacMan. :)
