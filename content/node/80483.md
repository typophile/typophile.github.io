  Experiment in Criticism]], and I thought it would be fun to adapt it to typography:\r\n\r\nGood
  fonts are those which permit, invite, or compel good design. The function of typographic
  criticism is to multiply, prolong, and safeguard experiences of good design.\r\n\r\nIf
  I say I like [[Helvetica]], and you are sure that it is bad, then you could say
  my taste is bad. On what do you base your position? If it is your own taste, then
  you are just being insolent. If you say so because of the prevailing view of the
  typographic community, then how long will this last? It is only a matter of time
  before fashion changes.\r\n\r\nSuppose you had a different way to approach it. You
  might encourage me to talk about Helvetica, and discover that I have the worst sort
  of attitudes about design and typography (laziness, trendiness, etc). Suppose you
  then went around to other designers, and found that everyone who likes Helvetica
  shared the same bad attitudes. You would have solid ground for a steadily growing
  conviction that Helvetica is bad, arguing that 'Since all who enjoy Helvetica do
  so by applying the worst sort of design, Helvetica is probably a bad typeface'.\r\n\r\nThis
  approach has three advantages: first, it fixes our attention on the act of design
  in operation rather than abstract considerations. Second, basing judgment on how
  someone designs is much stronger than basing it on what typefaces they choose, which
  is subject to fashion. Finally, this method makes critical condemnation a very laborious
  task, which is a good thing (it is too easy otherwise).\r\n\r\nThis method relies
  on separating true [[typophile|typophiles]] from the general public. However, if
  you can find even one type lover who is fanatical about a given typeface, who would
  notice if there were a change, who would spend money to replace it if necessary,
  then you would need to exercise great caution before condemning it. Helvetica, under
  this method, could never be called a bad typeface. However, [[Comic Sans]] and [[Cheltenham]]
  (aka 'Chelt') might be."

    the example of Cheltenham in there at the end, contra Helvetica? \r\n\r\nHere
    is a typeface with a longer history than Helvetica, the recorded plaudits of a
    number of respected historical designers/typographers (W. A. Dwiggins among them)
    and notable use currently in the headlines of <em>The New York Times</em>.\r\n\r\n\u201C.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

  body: Nah, Arial is much closer to 'bad' than ever ol' Chelt. I'd never buy a religious
    tract because it was set in Arial. I did do that for Cheltenham.

  body: I was actually teasing a bit with Cheltenham. I mention it only because of
    its attraction to American advertisers, and because of [[Douglas McMurtrie]]'s
    quote that 'The appearance of most magazine and commercial printing will be improved
    by the simple expedient of denying any variants of the Cheltenham design to compositors'.

  body: "Kent,\r\n\r\nOK - I put my foot in my mouth about Chelt, and your response
    shows that I am all wet. The great thing about the system is that Dwiggins' praises
    are exactly what is needed to establish Chelt as fine type. Interestingly, the
    fact that the NYT uses it is not enough to do so, unless it is clear that the
    paper uses it because it contributes to the overall design, as opposed to cost
    or tradition (or apathy).\r\n\r\nReynir,\r\n\r\n[[Arial]] is actually a perfect
    example for this system. It is popular, but for [[http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html|non-typographical
    reasons]].\r\n\r\n-Neil"

    design tool. There I've said it.

  body: "<cite>Anyone's praises or damnation do not make any typeface in to a fine
    type.</cite>\r\n\r\nI completely agree, Chris. The quality of the type is inherent
    to its design, and public opinion, even of type lovers, cannot make a bad font
    into a good one (or vice versa).\r\n\r\nI like Lewis's theory because it does
    not attempt to define what makes good art good. Rather, it tries to make rejecting
    art more difficult. I said that Dwiggins' praise was enough to establish Chelt
    as fine type, because he is someone who clearly loves typography and design, and
    he also loves Chelt. It would have been enough that Kent or you love Chelt. \r\n\r\nEstablishing
    the fact that a type has value is easy; establishing the opposite is and should
    be hard. Lewis uses the analogy of a spider - you can show that there is a spider
    in the room simply by pointing to one. To show that there isn't, you need to take
    the room apart. "

  body: Establishing truth or falsehood involving discussions of the physical sciences
    is a totally different matter. Getting universal agreement among the majority
    of humans on what type is good or not is not only far more complicated but it
    is a moving target with opinions changing with time.  Perhaps you are looking
    for an Uncertainty Principle that can be applied to the ever-shifting opinion
    patterns of people on typography?  ;-)
