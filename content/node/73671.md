body: "I'm looking for some sans fonts with thick (bold/black), wide, low x-height
  capital letters. Some ideas I've tried already are Neutra Display, Agenda Black,
  Nevis... along those lines. I often see these fonts with wide kerning as subtext
  in logos.\r\n\r\nI know this is only one letter, but very similar to Rokkans R:

  R that would be great too)\r\n\r\nI will find some more examples. Sorry if this
  is the wrong thread to post in."

  body: "When you say \"low x-height capital letters\" I presume you mean low-waisted,
    where the crossbars are below the midline of the letter. (x-height refers to the
    lower case letters, specifically the height of 'x', as compared to the height
    of upper case letters and ascenders. <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bernhard-modern/\">Bernhard
    Modern</a> is an example of a low-x-height typeface, i would say).\r\n\r\nYou
    might consider fonts from the <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/aviano/fonts/\">Aviano</a>
    family. Or Blair or Flatiron or Engravers Gothic. These often show up in places
    like you described. If you want more 'techno', such as Klavika, then look for
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/squarish+futuristic/fonts/\">squarish
    futuristic</a> fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
