  Association of Nancy (Association de Musique Ancienne de Nancy) or \"A.M.A.N\".
  I've played with the \"A\" and the \"M\" of \"Ancient\" and \"Music\" to create
  a kind of old monogram with the Caslon, which is contrasted by the contemporary
  face of the Fontin Sans.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aman01_5321.jpg]"

  body: That's very pleasing to the eye. I like the way the swashes look like musical
    clefs. Nice work :)

  body: I'm so glad I looked at this, because I then looked at your website and then
    looked at Jos's website too, neither of which I've seen before. Superb. Thank
    <em>you</em>.
