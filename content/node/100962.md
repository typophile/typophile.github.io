  with. It may have been slightly modified, but the P should be in it's original form.
  I seem to remember this font being a REALLY common font or at least a variation
  of a common font. I just can't for the life of me find it again.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone
  for your help."

  body: THANK YOU! I believe your Right. It is a variation of Stone Sans; for some
    reason it got wiped from my computer accidentally, and has been driving me crazy.
    Your help is much appreciated!
