body: "I recently came across the amazing branding for Arts Santa Monica. I know that
  the font in use is a custom font called ASM by Textaxis. Does anyone know any font
  like that. I don\u2019t really care for the underlines, I\u2019m merely talking
  about the shape of the letters: http://sgustokdesign.com/archive/Cla-se-Arts-Santa-Monica.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot in advance"

  body: ASM is not exclusively licenced to the museum any more, so you could just
    buy it <a href="http://www.type-o-tones.com/fonts.php?id=62">here</a>. Or are
    you looking for something similar, but different?
