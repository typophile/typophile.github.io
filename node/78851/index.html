  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I came across an interesting project and wanted to get the opinions of the gurus here at typophile.

It's a novel length fantasy - 600+ pages - and it needs designed.

Things to keep in mind:
There are to be two versions of the book - one to be read and one to be looked at (it's a self-aware object — also read as: deluxe edition)
The book (text) is about the book (object) and its writer.
Moreover, the book spans from about 400 B.C. to the 1960s. 
Finally, the pen "writing" the book was stolen from the book of fate and is writing in its own distinctive hand.


I've been struggling with font choices. I normally use a historically appropriate family and run with it. In order to do so on this project, I'd need a timeless or better yet, an immortal font.

It's an interesting concept and I thought I'd throw it out into the forums. Would a full-out calligraphic solution be appropriate for the object? If so, what would the "readable" book be set in to coordinate? The book not only spans centuries, but also jumps from continent to continent, making references to many of the greatest civilizations in history. An entire chapter could be set in Chinese in the object and it would be correct... but should it be? In short, I have so many options that my head is spinning.

What would you do?

She believes I can give it the care it deserves since I've seen her working at it since its beginning. (no pressure) She intends have copies of my version created for her own library and for her friends/family/colleagues... while she's trying to get it published. 

She's worried that it's too much of an artist book to ever get picked up by a publisher and that even if it does get picked up that it would become just another paperback on the fiction shelf. She wants it to be thoughtful and special. And since I owe her big-time, I'm I'm willing to do whatever I have to, to make this project really fantastic.

Does that help at all? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Clearly, Times Roman is right out. So, unfortunately, is, say, Cloister Lightface. And Univers would clearly be the exact opposite of what you want.

I would say that one might sort of squeak by with, say, Caledonia or Garamond. A typographer would peg them to a particular era, but they don't strongly suggest a particular era to the general reader. But I'm pretty sure you want something a bit less ordinary than this. (Weiss Roman and Palatino are a notch more decorative, still not heavily temporalized, but they're still fairly routine as well.)

The suggestions so far given here are excellent ones, but if you want to use a typeface that is more conventional than a calligraphic one... then, although Cloister Lightface or Jenson is not feasible (great for a deluxe edition of something like <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, yes, but not this) I think the closely related typeface Centaur might do very nicely.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Fantastic ideas all around - thanks all! - I've lately become a fan of Catull and I will definitely be looking more into Beorcana (somehow I hadn't heard of that one before - thanks for the link).

Centaur was definitely on the short list for the readable version - just above Garamond.

I don't know that the Lord of the Rings  is so far off from what my friend is thinking. I believe the image she has floating around is of a small leather bound tome with wood cuts and (1592 GLC Garamond) captions.

I'm trying to convince her that readability is just as important as this grand "look" she wants. After all, if you can't get from one cover to the other, what was the point of ten years of writing?

As for the gilded cage - at least one year? Could it work with a shorter-term lease?

Why not? 

Depends on the terms, though.

<cite>… one year? Could it work with a shorter-term lease?</cite>

Well, to speak but for myself: there have been glyphs which took me 15 minutes, there have been others which took me four years. So, ‘one year’ is just a suggested approximation.
And it’s not that much for getting something “immortal” or “fatal”  ;-)</div>

American Typewriter.  Just thought it needed repeating. : )

Andreas - it's not a question of value versus time. I believe that brilliant minds deserve pampered lifetimes to create timeless pieces. My short-lease comment came strictly from the pocketbook of a sad little in-house designer who also dreams of gilded cages (though mine normally situate themselves in the south of France). ; )

A few "object" faces that come to mind: Trinité, Brioso and Maiola. I also second Beorcana. Of these, Trinité is perhaps best suited to handle both the "book" and the "object", with it's variants - no. 4 italic for the most extreme. With Brioso, there's the obvious pair Kazuraki for Hiragana, Katakana and quite a bit of Kanji (I'm no expert on Chinese, but I seem to remember that they share at least the Kanji signs with the Japanese).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's strange that Brioso was mentioned. 
I've used it a few times with some success professionally - pairing it with Kanji (Japanese). Brioso was my first thought for the object version, but I didn't think anyone else would read it for 600 pages. I've been fond of that family since it first came out, but I always had a little guilt attached to using it. 

I think I'm going to try the first 20 or so pages in Brioso, Trinité and Beorcana respectively - I think those will fit the "object" version very well.  

Now for the "readable" version... I think that frode frank is absolutely right in that Trinité can stand up to both versions, but I worry for Brioso and Beorcana. Centaur, Caslon, and Catull and Garamond are the forerunners for the readable - I'd be interested to hear what pairings everyone here would suggest.

This thread has been incredibly helpful - thanks again!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Charles_e - I agree totally, but I think that's what is making this project as interesting as it is. I've looked at type differently since working on it. I was always quick to label - humanist, old style, transitional, slab - use what is appropriate to the project. (and normally what falls under the company standards). This has been an opportunity to look at fonts that rather blur the edges of the categories I've been a little too tight with - at least in the object version. 

Is it possible to take the pieces we like best from different styles and create something new and perhaps, timeless? I like to hope so - I bet the gurus here could do it - but as stated above: a gilded cage, with appropriate beverages and a lengthy lease would be needed.

: )

Excellent book suggestion too.</div>

Is it possible to combine all the best parts of recipes for our favorite food dishes and come up with something edible? Let's see, I like Sushi, Chocolate ice-cream sundaes, Hot and Sour Soup, Apple Pie, Huevos Rancheros, Lamb Vindalou...</div>

It's not mixing entire dishes, but definitely mixing ingredients that shouldn't go together in new and inventive ways.
I wouldn't put it past some mad genius to come up with a way to do it typographically - but that's just me and my optimism.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, Times Roman is generally considered not to be comparable to combining chocolate ice cream with sweet and sour ribs... although it's definitely not timeless, either.

While the authentic Phemister old style is clearly Victorian, Century Oldstyle... no, it's too condensed, and so it looks like it belongs in the phototypesetter era.

Goudy Friar was admitted to be a "Typographical Solecism" by Goudy... and then there's Goudy Thirty, which, amazingly enough from my point of view, has been digitized. For something with an "old" feeling, and yet not localizable to a particular epoch, they have some merit, although I don't think they are actually quite what you seek.</div>

Athelas is a nice, classic looking but rather recently created, serif font too, with roots in English typography.
