  me to make their identity design. The place will be called d505 which is the name
  of the street and number where it is. It's going to be open from 8 to 6 and although
  it's in a rather classy neighborhood almost all its clients would be office people
  that work nearby. They'll basically serve breakfasts, coffee and some small dishes
  for a quick lunch. It would be more of a place to stop by for a while rather than
  sitting and eating for an hour.\r\n\r\nI'd like the concept to be modern but not
  too hype as I think the target of the place is going to be kinf of conservative.
  I've started to sketch stuff using franklin gothic and a combination of dark grey
  and turquoise blue. If someone has a suggestion or a bar identity site I can browse
  through it would be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"
