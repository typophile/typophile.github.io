  body: Welcome to Typophile, Kumbuniko! <BR> <BR>Which typeface do you need, the
    Vogue logo? If that&#39;s the one  <BR>you&#39;re after, there&#39;s a fat chance
    it&#39;s custom designed. There  <BR>are a couple of Didones though which might
    be to your liking.  <BR>Check <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33672.html?1082507916"
    target="_blank"> this thread</a> to begin with, and get back to us if you&#39;d
    like  <BR>more options. <BR> <BR>P.S. Mean? <i>Us?</i> Whaddayamean? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Thanks for the speedy reply.  <BR> <BR>I should have made myself clearer.
    My bad. I was refering to the VOGUE logo - yes.  <BR> <BR>That thread was helpful,
    thanks again! <BR> <BR>Does anyone have any advice for someone starting out in
    typography. Such as tips on developing skills, knowledge, experience.  <BR> <BR>mwah

  body: 'At the moment my goal is to gain skills in the use of type. But my goal is
    to eventually attempt at my very own. But I would prefer to get more background
    knowledge before this happens. <BR>  <BR>For the time being I am just practising
    by hand rendering ones that already exist and then tweaking them for poster designs
    etc.  <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve been a great help so far Mr Troubleman - so I will be
    sticking around!  <BR> <BR>So far I have learnt that type designers are quite
    disturbed!  <BR> <BR>Not scared no... not yet anyway. '
