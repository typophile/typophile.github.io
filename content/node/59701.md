  sticker/decal. You've seen them before \"HOW'S MY DRIVING? 1-800-555-5555\". I'm
  looking for suggestions on typefaces to use. Legibility is essential, as the bumper
  sticker/decal has size limitations and will be read while in movement. \r\n\r\nI'm
  reaching out to the typography community for suggestions - You input would be most
  appreciated.  \r\n\r\nSunny. "

  body: 'Some of the most legible typefaces are the ones that designers hate, like
    Arial and Souvenir. Designers avoid them because they''re bland and boring, but
    there''s a reason folks keep using them: Their lack of subtle refinement makes
    them easy to read under less-than optimal conditions (e.g., driving past at 70
    mph).'

    \u2014 Canadian highway\r\n\r\nI think the \"invisible/boring/familiar\" approach
    should be strongly considered (Helvetica?). It <em>is</em> somewhat ironic making
    an eye-catching bumper sticker, taking drivers attention away from the road, in
    the spirit of driving safety.\r\n\r\nWithout getting into a scientific debate,
    I would recommend upper and lowercase over caps (Bhouma, 1971) and opening up
    the tracking a bit (Pelli, 2008).\r\n\r\nIt may be worth finding out the predominant
    road-sign typeface in your clients region and select the same so it blends in
    with the typographic landscape.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may want to take the
    \"+ frequency of exposure = good\" approach. Following that logic you could rationalize
    using basterdized Airal caps. An interesting challenge. To counterbalance attention
    to the road with attention to the sticker while communicating a message."

  body: Some fonts that are designed to remain readable in very small print also work
    well at moderate sizes when viewed from considerable distance. Try Officina Sans
    or Bell Centennial, especially if the condensed widths will help fit your space
    constraints.

  body: "SunnyGosal -\r\n\r\nConsider whether your bumper sticker will be appearing
    on a long-haul semi truck or a neighborhood delivery vehicle. The legibility of
    the DIN-Interstate-Clearview highway fonts is tested and scored in the context
    of headline display letters on stationary signs posted along state or federal
    highways, and I don't know if it's all that applicable in the context of a bumper
    sticker that's to be seen at local stop lights and businesss parking lots. A non-highway
    sans font might serve your purposes better."

    I disagree with your argument regarding the applicability of the testing and research
    to this use, it is still probably a good idea to use a non-highway type of alphabet.
    Don't ever pass up an opportunity to instill your brand on the public. Your decision
    on what font to use on the bumper sticker should be coordinated with the entire
    identity process of the organization you are working for.\r\n\r\nHow did that
    old bumper sticker go? \"HOW IS MY DRIVING? Call 1-800-EAT SH*T\""

    faster than the US did. I believe that Canada does not have the federal equivalent
    of the FHWA, so these decisions were able be made on the municipal and provincial
    level without approval from the federal government.\r\n\r\nAt last count, Clearview
    was being used in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, British Columbia."
