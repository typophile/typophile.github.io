  or something that reminds people of letterdrawing vs. typography? Otherwise people
  who want primarily to share ideas about type design itself, are constantly tripping
  over \"HELP ME: WHAT FONT SHOULD I USE FOR A(ny) BOOK!\" or \"HELP ME: What FONT
  IS THIS?\" \u2014 both of which are legitimate questions, (somewhere & sometimes,
  though usually they indicate lazy thinking/acting). At present, it makes \"Design\"
  like wading through the clutching crowds at Mumbai International, looking for your
  handlers. :)"
