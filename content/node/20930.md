  critique on a logo I have designed. \r\n\r\nIt is for a Swiss bank who are situated
  on the Italian border. I have shown them various logos, the one attached as well
  as some more traditional looking swiss designed ones. They thankfully chose this
  logo to move forward with. It is quite rare to see banks using scripted logos so
  I was excited that they chose it, but I am not an expert in Scripted letterforms
  so could do with a few pointers. \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

    that gets faxed somewhere.\r\n\r\nWhat if you posted another picture in a more
    realistic size. With some text perhaps?"

  body: "Yeah I have been wondering about the weight of it and it is looking a little
    flimsy, I have attached a couple of letterhead designs with some lorum ipsum to
    show you how it might be used. \r\n\r\nIts GLZ by the way, I had a problem before
    where the Z was also looking like and L which is why I added the cross bar. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LH1_6346.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/LH2_3608.jpg]"

  body: "Matt,\r\n\r\nI have to agree with earlier posts. You will get problem in
    smaller sizes.  Desigwise I think\r\nit's balanced etc. Just make it heavier and
    you'll be fine. Btw I was surprised to find your stationed (or maybe even living)
    in Stockholm, Sweden! Typophile sure narrow things down.\r\n\r\nGood luck with
    the project"

    opinion, with the the slightly less dominating logo. I think \r\nthe Z needs a
    bit of work to make it look more like a a Z. \r\nPossibly make the diagonal a
    bit more upright.\r\n\r\nPhil"

  body: "Thanks for the comments guys, \r\n\r\nI think making the downstroke on the
    Z a little more upright is a good suggestion, it will reflect the downstrokes
    of the other letters, probably bring a bit more harmony to the logo. \r\n\r\nIts
    been an interesting process creating the logo, scripts I think are something we
    all neglect a little too much and it certainly is a wake up call when you are
    faced with designing one. I am not a type designer but the research that I needed
    to put into this project has been a little more tasking than others. It was like
    going back to college, but I guess thats what its all about. \r\n\r\nI will work
    on thickening the strokes a little and let you know.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nMatt"

  body: "It appears that the G is too far away from the L. Can you create some interaction
    ( as you have with the L and the Z). with those two glyphs the create a unified
    mark. Also the G appears lighter than the other two glyphs. This screams out to
    me more of a monogram and less three separate glyphs.\r\n\r\nJust a thought."
