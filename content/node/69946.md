  anyone know what the last two glyphs being pluralized are? I am curious.\r\n\r\nAs
  a bonus, did anyone know that the plural of beef is beeves?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beeves_5763.jpg]"

    found that confusing, looking up the unicode values. The Scorpio sign is NOT the
    Minum sign. They are different glyphs. Kind of close, but not quite. But we are
    supposed to pretend? Kind of irritating.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, grammer is grammar,

    tense of 'work'. \"I wrought overtime this week.\")"

    minim, drop\u2019, indicating that this character is intended to be used for both
    scorpius and minim.\r\n\r\nSomewhat confusingly, \u264D U+264D (virgo) is annotated

    for disunifying the minim sign from U+264F, you would need to be able to document
    a consistent glyph distinction in pre-Unicode usage."
