body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nCan I get some help with this one, please? I thought it was
  a squooshed Helvetica Black Condensed, but it doesn't quite match up. The counter
  in that P in particular. Is it possibly some Hyper Condensed version of Helvetica
  I don't have? \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n/stephen\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Perros-No_3429.jpg]"
