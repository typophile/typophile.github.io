body: 'Why doesnt the automatic fi ligature work in Quark 4 with my font? I exported
  the font with Mac Roman encoding, as a Postscript Type 1, in Font Lab 4.6. The ligature
  is in the right place too. Is there anything else I should do? <BR>And yes, I did
  activate the function in Quark '

  body: Tech problem with his fi ligature and Quark. <BR> <BR>This is a thread started
    in the DESIGN area. I thought might get a few more useful eyeballs on it if it
    were here in the BUILD area.
