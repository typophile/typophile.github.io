  and S to Gill Sans. <BR>The brush script has a different b to the normal &#40;plus
  stencil cut outs&#41;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14822.jpg"

  body: I&#39;ll guess that the sans at least is not from a digital font and <BR>the
    closest you&#39;ll get is Gotham or <a href="http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?CFID=100108&amp;CFTOKEN=34681066&amp;SKU=BS10111"
    target="_blank">Proxima Sans</a>. <BR> <BR>That G isn&#39;t featured in either
    of those, though.
