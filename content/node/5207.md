  body: ' Peter, <BR> <BR>I applaud three things: <BR> <BR>1, The caps are a good
    height - shorter than  <BR>ascenders. Too often designers of pixel fonts  <BR>forget
    what&#39;s been learned from traditional  <BR>typography. <BR> <BR>2, The extensive
    character set. I suppose we <BR>should expect a good number of accented glyphs
    <BR>from a Swede. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>3, The uc &#39;W&#39;. It&#39;s nice. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    great to see you here. I admire your work <BR>and often point to Mercury&#39;s
    little &#39;g&#39; when <BR>people ask why I love typography so much. <BR> <BR>Welcome.

  body: ' I like this a lot. <BR> <BR>To echo Stephen, the UC height is great. The
    <BR>numerals are nice too. <BR> <BR>The &#39;serifs&#39; on the lc f and l as
    well as the UC I  <BR>and J are a nice touch. The lc r is also nice.   <BR>These
    nuances illustrate how attentiveness to  <BR>optics at this scale is more important
    than  <BR>how it&#39;s &#39;supposed&#39; to be drawn. <BR> <BR>I have to get
    knit-picky and say that I don&#39;t care  <BR>for the fat arrowheads hanging on
    those thin  <BR>stems. Perhaps they don&#39;t need stems... <BR> <BR>Out of curiousity,
    what are your plans for this  <BR>face? A bold version? <BR> <BR>//joe '

    in the regular font &amp; just put them &amp; all the other figures in a dingbat
    set...?! <BR> <BR>I thought it would be nice to have a quick font for small texts
    in web graphics. <BR> <BR>A bold version wou&ouml;ld be nice..if I ever get the
