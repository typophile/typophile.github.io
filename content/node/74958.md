body: "Hola! amigos,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a logo for company. The company has recently
  reached a milestone of reaching 1 million members. They want a visual mark/logo
  to use on commemorative plaques, buttons and other items. I've started with a simple
  approach. I believe the acronym for 1 million is 1M. This is for use in the US.
  Please check out my sketches and let me know what you think. \r\n\r\ngracias.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1mil_5548.jpg]"

    Because this company is US wide. It's broken into several branches, meaning states.
    This particular achievement is for two states. The client wants something that
    is simple yet sophisticated and not necessarily representing the neaty-gritty
    side of the business. They want to focus more on the excellence of the achievement.
    This logo will used in various applications such, Board Members Award Plaque,
    Annual Report, Employee t's/commemorative plaque...etc. \r\n\r\n@ luma - yes,
    i found that exact one as well. good inspiration for me.\r\n\r\n@ riccard0 - me

    feels a bit tall and skinny. I would lower the arc where it meets the stem (or
    1). I would also try cutting the left side of the middle serif off. That would
    help distance it from looking like '1n'. Try looking at different slab serif 'm's
    to see how they're constructed. For instance: [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/preusstype/arventa-std-slab/?testdrive=seed%3D35%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D240%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3Dm%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga|Arventa]]"

  body: The slab is nice, but it feels very tall. The proportions of chillyphilli's
    suggestion are very appropriate for the time, and so is the sans-ness of it. We
    all know a company brand shouldn't have a time- or trend-specific logo, but where
    this is a marker of a specific time, I think it fits the bill. Thoughts?

    Now that's it's pointed out that it looks like an M&M "M" I'm can't stop seeing
    it. =|  I gotta keep reminding myself it's not going to be used without it's tagline
    "million members". I hope that helps differentiate it from the M&M feel. thanks

- body: "I like #5 best. It's cool and it doesn't read m&m's. Minor tweak: the 1 is
    just a hair too thick to my eye. It's likely just an optical illusion, but the
    1 looks thicker than the other two. Oh! And the top right corner of the 1 looks
    a teeny bit lower than the arc of the em it would hypothetically connect to (if
    the break wasn't there.) That imaginary line looks like it has a kink in it. \r\n\r\nI
    think you need to stack \"MILLION MEMBERS\" to make it readable at smaller sizes.
    Even printed at two inches high, it's just too tiny (and too frail) to read. \r\n\r\nAll
    those repetitive tall stems in \"MILLION\" really don't help, either. Have you
    considered switching to lowercase for readability? Or choosing a heavier font
    weight? The block of skinny uppercase letters look very uptight - and kinda scared
    - under a single organic and bold lowercase em.\r\n\r\nJust my humble opinion.
    :) \r\n"

    It tells the story. It actually reads: \"1 m\" Without it, the logo is nothing
    but an odd-looking \"m\" just like the marchFIRST logo/mess."
