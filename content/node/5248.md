body: I have only been using FontLab 4.6 for a couple of months and am no expert with
  it. I had been working on a font and with my first few test versions of it, ligaitures
  worked fine and as expected. My last few versions, the Ligs don&#39;t come through
  in text.  When using InD, the glyph pallette works but any automatic use will not
  work.  I have checked and rechecked all preferences and dialogues in both FontLab
  and InD and can&#39;t figure out what is different and or wrong.  I am sure it is
  &#34;user error&#34; and any help would be appreciated. I am pretty sure it is a
  setting in FontLab that I have screwed up because when I change to a commercial
  opentype font using the same text, the Ligs work properly. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>
