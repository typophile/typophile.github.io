body: I am in a typography class, and have to do research on three types. I have identified
  them all, but I now need to find out more about the history of them. The three types
  are Stymie Medium, New Caslon Italic, and Tudor Black. If anybody has any information
  on them that would be a big help. Thanks.

    the the well-known Egyptienne font Memphis for the American Type Founders (ATF)
    in 1931. The result was the Stymie font family.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you should try
    it?"

  body: I guess I should have clarified, I have done research on the internet. And
    I have found that information already on Stymie, but I am looking for more than
    just the basic historical facts. I found out that the New Caslon Italic was designed
    in 1906, and for the Inland Type Foundry. However I have not been able to find
    anything on the Tudor Black.

    typeface Tudor Black':\r\n\r\n[[http://www.oakknoll.com/bookexcerpt.php?booknr=72642]]\r\n\r\n<cite>EDWARD
    PHILIP PRINCE was born in 1846, in Kennington, south London, where his father
    was a schoolmaster. At the age of sixteen he was apprenticed to the well-known
    punch-cutter Frederick Tarrant, and continued to work for Tarrant for many years.
    In about 1878, Tarrant and Prince cut the punches for the typeface Tudor Black,
    based on a 15th century model, for Miller & Richard. </cite>"

  body: "Thank you for that link. I did research Tudor Black on the internet, but
    I guess I did not use the word \"typeface\" in the search. I used the word \"font\".
    That one word made all the difference. Thanks again for your help.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a link where I found the information on New Caslon Italic.\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/inland/\r\n\r\nI
    also found some information on Stymie Medium at MyFonts.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stymie/\r\n\r\nI
    have also gone through Mac McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth
    Century\", where I was able to find a little bit of information."
