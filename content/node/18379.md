  body: 'The signage typeface used at the moment is called BAA Bembo, and was drawn
    by Shelley Winter. I believe Freda Sack worked on it too. I Recently went to a
    Sign Design Society talk by Rob Waller, who has done some legibilty testing on
    it. His testing showed it to be surprisingly legible compared to Frutiger and
    Vialog. '

  body: 'Broadly, each typeface was shown on a screen at a very small, illegible size,
    using a common English word. The word was then made progressively bigger, quite
    quickly. The sitter had to press a button when the type became legible. The sitter
    was asked what the word was, to make sure they had read it correctly. The different
    reaction times were then compiled and compared against one another. Using this
    method, Frutiger bold came out as most legible, followed by BAA Bembo, followed
    by Vialog. I can''t remember how many people were tested. '

  body: "So is the screen the environment that the typeface will exist in, and have
    to be legible in? Or is it going to be used on physical signs? If it is the latter,
    I'm afraid that the \"Legibility Study\" you refer to is meaningless.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    this is quite common, designers make decisions about how a typeface is suppose
    to function based on a screen environment. The only way to test legibilty of signage
    typefaces is to but them in the real environment, made out of the real materials
    that they will eventually have to perform on. Anything less is smoke and mirrors.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's three years old now, but someone just mentioned this thread to me and
    I thought I'd take a look... can't let the smoke and mirrors jibe pass without
    comment!\r\n\r\nI'm also thinking about this issue just now, as I'm speaking about
    it at our University of Reading Typeface Design short course tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe
    issue terminaldesign refers to is known as ecological validity - all testers have
    to consider how the real world environment affects users. It obviously does affect
    things hugely, but it isn't practical to test in the way td suggests. We considered
    this carefully for the BAA research. To install a sign at a busy airport is expensive
    - it requires specialist teams of workers, scaffolding, coordination from different
    departments, risk assessments, etc. That's for each version of each sign. Signs
    also come in many shapes and sizes, some of them backlit, some not - should we
    test them all? To what purpose? And they have to compete with commercial signing,
    and be usable by people from different cultures, in a stressful situation. There's
    no possibility of testing signs like these in the real environment with real materials
    and real people.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this was a strictly limited study of typeface
    choice. We saw no particular reason why each typeface would not be equally affected
    by the move from simulation to the real world, so the comparison was fair. And
    we argued that any halation effect from the screen display would in some respects
    be equivalent to the backlit signs that are the majority. We controlled ambient
    lighting using a light meter to match the recommended lighting levels that BAA
    aim at for airport environments.\r\n\r\nWe used 25 participants who viewed each
    typeface using a range of different common English words, in a number of colourways,
    in random order. This amounted to hundreds of viewings. The number of participants
    needs to be adequate to give statistically significant results - after a certain
    number, the law of diminishing returns kicks in and you are wasting time and money.\r\n\r\nThe
    technique of slowly enlarging the font is in a long-standing tradition in which
    type is presented in threshold conditions using, for example, tachistocopes (they
    flash images up very quickly), moving images on rails, or even signs mounted on
    trucks driving towards the viewer.\r\n\r\nA notable feature of our methodology
    is the use of an 'Aunt Sally' typeface choice (one that is set up simply in order
    to be knocked down), in order to provide a sense of scale in the differences we
    find. I am sceptical about research which finds statistical differences that in
    real life are very small. In this case we used Garamond Italic as our Aunt Sally
    - a typeface most would expect to be relatively illegible for airport signing.
    Our thinking was that if our methodology could not distinguish between Garamond
    Italic and, say, Frutiger Bold, then it was just not working. And it would tell
    us where BAA Sign (the version of BAA Bembo we were testing) sits on a scale between
    Garamond Italic and Frutiger.\r\n\r\nWe also triangulated our research through
    a wider study of personal preferences and style associations of 400 people, split
    between the UK (familiar with BAA airports) and Germany (less so). And we surveyed
    a panel of expert sign designers, researchers and type designers.\r\n\r\nSome
    designers may make decisions based on screen environments. However, our work was
    informed by our experience of researching and designing wayfinding systems for
    numerous hospitals, museums, and other public buildings, and additional research
    experience with bus, rail and air travellers.\r\n\r\nThe 'growing word' technique
    we used here, by the way, is only valid in my view for applications that, like
    signs, consist of single words or short phrases. Type for continuous reading is
    a different matter entirely. \r\n\r\nThe BAA research can be found in Waller R,
    (2007) 'Comparing typefaces for airport signs', Information Design Journal, vol
    15: 1-15. "
