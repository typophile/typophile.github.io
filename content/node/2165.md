  body: Could you post  a close-up? Or maybe a pdf? <BR>At this size the serifs seem
    odd to me... <BR> <BR>So far I think several of the UC-characters look interesting
    &#40;I really like the D for instance&#41; <BR> <BR>More to come... <BR> <BR>:-&#41;

  body: i think it looks good with the smaller serifs that Nicolai Kruse did.  but
    it looks very good.  could we see the fi ligature used in a few words maybe?

  body: Thanks for your comments. <BR>While I appreciate Nicolai&#39;s amends I really
    wanted to have a powerful slab serif on this font to make strong horizontal emphasis,
    I have attached a use of the ligature, I am still in the process of amending.
