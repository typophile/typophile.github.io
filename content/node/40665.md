  I've cleaned the font caches.\r\n\r\nAny clue to where I should look to fix?\r\n\r\nThx!"

    "400" as their weight number.

    (made a mistake it's Text not book). The weights of the fonts are 400, 500, 600
    and 700."

  body: "\"Not a good idea to have Book and Regular in the same family, as both have
    \u201C400\u201D as their weight number.\" \r\n\r\nThis conflates two separate
    issues:\r\n\r\n1) All different weights in a family should have different values
    for usWeightClass. There are other potential complications with usWeightClass:
    see my first post in this thread (with the big chart)... http://typophile.com/node/16327
    \r\n\r\n2) InDesign (only) has some issues with families that have multiple fonts
    that it considers to be \"regular\" weight, which includes the name \"book\" among
    others. See my and Miguel's posts in this thread: http://www.typophile.com/node/35394
    (where I again explained that this was a separate issue, despite Nick's belief
    that one was causing the other problem)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

  body: "<em>Nick\u2019s belief that one was causing the other problem</em>\r\n\r\nMy
    \"belief\" is correct, as an observation of the way that FontLab assigns 400 to
    both Book and Regular, in the first page of its Font Info dialog. I'm also aware
    of the problem with InDesign, but didn't mention it (I try to avoid criticizing
    Adobe).\r\n\r\nThanks for clarifying the issue, with links, Thomas.\r\n\r\nHappy
    New Year, Martin!"

  body: "Yes, FontLab assigns 400 to both, but that's easily overridden manually (as
    Martin thinks), and doesn't cause any problem other than poor sorting of styles
    within some Adobe apps.\r\n\r\nBut the reason I mention above is a much stronger
    reason not to have Book and Regular in the same family, which does not have any
    workaround, let alone a trivially easy one.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
