  body: "Looks like Corpid Office Bold to me. Or it could simply be Corpid Bold. I'm
    not sure I readily see the difference between the two. Definitely some sort of
    bold form of Corpid.\r\nhttp://www.lucasfonts.com"

  body: "Looks like you got it, although that web site is very stingy about letting
    you see complete samples of the fonts.\r\n\r\nWhat did you use as 'earmarks' to
    help you ID this one from these 6 letters, Bobby?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I figured the lettering had to be designed by Luc(as) De Groot. The "S" brought
    up "The Sans," but the cuts on the "t" and "i" narrowed it down to Corpid.
