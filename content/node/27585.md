body: I am currently working on a logo for a youth related event, that involves the
  letter X and numbers 9.16 (decimal included.) I have been using Clarendon because
  I wanted something that packs a punch and overall am looking for something powerful
  and bold, although I didnt know of any typefaces that do such and aren't as "serious"
  as clarendon. Any considerations are helpful. thanks!

  body: Look at the heavy weights of Dolly (Underware) and Omnes (Joshua Darden).
    The rounded corners keep 'em hefty but playful.

  body: I'll add that the lovely italics in Omnes make it one of the best, if not
    the best, rounded sans' currently available.
