body: "This is a current project of mine \u2014\_I am trying to make a contemporary
  display face inspired by some hand painted signs that I saw in India. The typography
  takes bits from bold Hindi script which inspires some of the quirks of the roman
  letters.  The other quirks come from how some Indian sign painters actually executed
  the roman letters.  The goal of the type is to look ethnic without being ethnocentric.
  \r\n\r\nI plan on using it as a logotype for a non profit. Right now I'm on the
  fence \u2014 is it quirky in a good way, or just plain ugly?  Is it intriguing enough
  that I should continue with additional letterforms to create an uncial typeface?
  \r\n\r\nAttached are two iterations of the proposed logotype, the top has a capitol
  n, and a relatively normal d (with a little quirk in the bowl.) The version on the
  bottom has an even quirkier D (which I prefer as it creates symmetry with the a,
  and continues the the rhythm of the rest of the the letterforms.)\r\n\r\nThis is
  in its infancy and line weights are not refined \u2014 Advice and criticism would
  be appreciated. "

  body: "This is really nice. I agree with Ben and like the lowercase n better than
    the upper, but I disagree with you and like the more conservative D than the really
    quirky one. And I usually really like quirkiness in typefaces. I just fear that
    it could be difficult to real in certain situations. I think if you are going
    to just create enough for the logo, than the really quirky D works.\r\n\r\nIs
    this all that you are going to create or do you think you are going to make a
    complete typeface?"

    it up went to grad school and decided that this was a venture that he would explore
    later. So as of now I have a half made glyph set and this logotype.  It will remain
    that way until he revisits the project or there is interest from someone else. '
