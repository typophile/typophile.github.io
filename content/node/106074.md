body: "P\xE9tala Pro gave his first steps almost ten years ago. During this time,
  the quest for perfection had forced several interruptions. It was necessary recalculate
  the route, tread other ways, discover new maps, and make easy curves. After all,
  a new milestone on typeface design was reached.\r\n\r\nP\xE9tala Pro combines readability
  with a gentle but strong personality. The smooth and balanced forms shares space
  with expressive ink traps. The 18 styles of the family \u2013 from Thin to Black
  \u2013 allow the flexibility needed to complex design briefs. When designing the
  different weights, rather than automated solutions, \u200B\u200Bsubtle adjustments
  were made to value the optical qualities of each style. Such care, makes all the
  difference under extreme conditions.\r\nThe wide variety of alternates, makes P\xE9tala
  Pro even more versatile. All the styles comes with a lot of advanced OpenType features
  such as stylistics sets, localized forms, contextual alternates, ligatures, small
  caps, numbers, fractions and more.\r\n\r\nP\xE9tala Pro brings your message with
  efficiency and personality for a multi-language environment and in any medium or
  support, such as video, mobile and computers screens. P\xE9tala Pro is the ideal
  choice for editorial, advertising, branding and corporate identity.\r\n\r\nAvailable
