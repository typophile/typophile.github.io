  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, I'm a student working on putting a bunch of portfolio books together for the end of the semester. I have to print all my work with my Epson R1400, and I have been having trouble finding good paper to print on. The main problems I run into are that the paper is not double-sided, it is not made for an inkjet printer, or the paper is too thick for pages in a book. I printed one of my books on Ilford Galerie Smooth Matte Multi-Use Dual Sided Inkjet Paper... but I can't seem to find the paper any larger than 8.5 x 11, which was fine when I was perfect binding, but now it is too small.


So... Does anyone know of any good inkjet paper to print images on for a book?
Any help would be wonderful. Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hahnemuhle has a couple of dual sided papers that might be nice. The Natural Art Duo is .15mil and Photo Duo is .18mil. They come in sizes up to 17x22 inches and may come in rolls. You can check out www.itsupplies.com or www.atlex.com. You could also check with www.shadesofpaper.com. Any of those vendors are helpful.

I don't really know if these would be too heavy or not but they are nice papers. Epson's enhanced matte dual-sided papers are nice too and don't seem overly heavy. I don't know about the sizes but it should come on a roll.

You might want to find a god art supply store that has packages of paper samples (Talas, for example, since it's in Manhattan), buy one, and try running as much as you can (and like) through.</div>

Me either, although I've found the quality to be a little lacking -- sort of the "it's not good enough to market it with our name and charge the big money, but we want to get rid of this stuff" thinking.

I've not used it, but I know a few folks who have used the Staples printer ink in their Epson and who thought the black was fine, but the colours left something to be desired.</div>

Ink sales are where the money is made. The printers do not make money on their own.</div>

So don't buy ink. Just buy more printers. They make excellent paperweights and lawn ornaments.

I doubt it. It’s got a different feel than Epson paper.

<cite>…but I know a few folks who have used the Staples printer ink in their Epson and who thought the black was fine, but the colours left something to be desired.</cite>

I did a lot of reading before I loaded up my R1800, and it seems to be one of those things that varies wildly by model. The newer Epson photo printers are much pickier than the old ones. 

Kodak is betting on a business model that involves selling inkjet printers at a profit and the ink at low prices. Unfortunately the quality is not up to professional work, and none of the printers handle paper larger than US Letter/A4. 

Anyway, my new Epson is already starting to streak, although that might just be because I loaded a few sheets backward and need to open the heads back up. But next time around I’m going with a Canon.</div>

IMO, better than Staples paper but won't break the bank. It also comes in many sizes as well. Use it on our old Epson 1280 without a problem.</div>
