    anything, especially if you only use the fill variant.\r\n\r\nI don't think I'd
    use Rosewood (or Rosewood Fill) unless I was designing a poster for a circus or
    carnival. It's become very overused recently (as your example demonstrates).\r\n\r\n

    seem to jive with circus or western cowboy type.  It seems to not take it seriously

    perhaps people that have low self esteem are more likely to wet the bed. \r\n\r\nOr
    something like that... \r\n\r\nAnyway, maybe the font doesn't fit the product

  body: this font may not be appropriate for student debt subject but as Casey quoted,
    i fully agree. This kind of typeface is in at the moment for this target audience
    so i think it seems ok. does anyone else agree?
