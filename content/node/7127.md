body: 'Hi everyone, <BR> <BR>Seeing as I only know crap ones, I&#39;m looking for
  a freelance &#40;or inexpensive&#41; good webdesigner to build me a serviced apartments
  website. Timescale is sometime over the next 3 months, most probably. <BR>There
  will also be a bit of logo design work. <BR>It will need a searchable database function
  which can be updated by me from my own computer. If it can be SEO&#39;d by the same
  guy &#40;or girl&#41; then that would be cool too. <BR>I don&#39;t need hosting
  for the site. <BR>For an example of what a serviced apartment website might look
  like, copy/ paste this:    central-london-apartments.com <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not asking
  anyone to copy that site, but I would like something which looks funkier. It needs
  to look professional and not like something from 1998. <BR>I posted on this board
  a while back and was impressed by the professional responses hence I returned. <BR>Oh
  yes, I&#39;m aware that this is a type discussion board but you guys will know a
  good designer or two, I&#39;m sure. <BR> <BR>Either post the contacts here or email
  to <a href="mailto:funkmachine@gmail.com">funkmachine@gmail.com</a> <BR> <BR>Cheers,
  <BR> <BR>Michael'
