  and have finally decided to post something of mine. This a logo for Kilo Records,
  a label that a friend of mine and myself are running and we'll be the spotlight
  band for now. However we want to be able to release things without being restricted
  to a particular genre, so I tried to go for an ecclectic feel. It's working really
  well for me right now but maybe some of you could shed some outside insight that
  could improve upon the design. \r\n\r\nI designed these from scratch using faces
  like Cooper Black and Sauna for reference. I might need to add \"records\" underneath
  the logo but since I can't afford Sauna I'd probably have to make the letters for
  that. Does anyone think that this part of the name would be necessary or not?\r\n\r\nOK,
  well thanks for your time,\r\n\r\nMike\r\n \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello. Welcome to the forum.\r\n\r\nI can see where you are going, but I
    think in the process you've created two ligatures instead of one smooth word.\r\n\r\n-
    You could exaggerate the terminal on the K more rounder) so it reads as a dot
    on the i more.\r\n- You could continue the exit on the i into the l as some scripts
    do.\r\n- You could eilimate the connections and just make the serifs more script
    like.\r\n- The lo is not working and reads more as an odd letter b\r\n- The connection
    of the Ki ... maybe re-visit how Sauna italic exits and enters on the strokes.
    Also take into consideration Bello.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the desire to depart and
    make it more ownable and hope my comments help in some way."

  body: "Thanks Miss Tiffinay, this my first real whack at doing custom lettering
    digitally like this. Bezier curves aren't exactly my strong point quite yet. So
    part of my excitement with this logo is simply that curves look nice. To me, anyway.
    \r\n\r\nI really appreciate the comments though and I'm going to check into a
    many of them and report back. I don't quite understand this suggestion though
    \"You could eilimate the connections and just make the serifs more script like.\"
    Or maybe it's that I don't want to have the letters sepearte.\r\n\r\nWith this
    version I like that there's a certain ambiguity about the serifs but I don't particularly
    want to seperate the characters. One thing I was thinking about trying was making
    some sort of tail on the top of the l to make it appear more like a cap. Maybe
    this could help distinguish it from being a \"b\"? \r\n\r\nWell, like I said this
    is still fairly new, so I might not be totally quick with an update but in a day
    or two I should have something new to show. More comments are welcome, I'm very
    friendly in discussion and just want to push it until the best result is there.
    Thanks again."

    progress. I actually do like the way you have it worked, I must've just wrote
    that off when I thought of connecting them all. For some reason I liked the idea
    that they were acting as sepearte ligatures. That is a nice result Jupiter, perhaps
    I'll try that myself."

    joins between the \"il\" and \"lo\" have a difference in weight that throws me
    off a bit.\r\n\r\nLook at the curves at the top of the \"l\" and the bottom of
    the \"K\" leg\u2014a bit rough.\r\n\r\nIt keeps getting better, and I can see
    your skill with the curves improving.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. I wish someone else

  body: "(Doing a good job so far James), the various iterations mean that the K needs
    some work it is too soft and rubbery now the leg seems to be swamping the i I
    think if you made the vertical a bit more vertical like the l you could start
    the sweep of the leg earlier and bring it lower down to make more of a curve up
    into the l. I would also try making the i dot more like the counter of the o.\r\nTim"

    d'oh. I'm not sure about the K, it could probably lose some fat but I really like

    when I get back home tonight.

    i've been kind of sitting on this a while. i was wondering what you're opinion
    is of these reincarnations. the most current is on top. i thought i might have
    been on to something with the middle one but i was getting a lot of swooshes and
    right now i think someone fresh to it might read it as something else entirely.
    and i don't really dig the cavity it makes. but i'm not sure if stripping it more
    basic (top) makes it better. i had to try some other options though besides the
    ki ligature. which do you find most compelling, or is their one you feel stronger
    about than the others? what would make it better? thank you kindly."
