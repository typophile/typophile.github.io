  Donuts in Rhode Island. I didn't see it anywhere else in the store and haven't seen
  it since. I'm presuming it's a proprietary Dunkin' Donuts face, but was curious
  if anyone else knows any more details about it (who designed it, when, etc):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pull_3842.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/push_3601.jpg]"

  body: It reminds me of Dogma but it's not the same font. Maybe a custom?

    customized some of it's main characteristics, like the \"S\" for example was rotated
    180 degrees...\r\n\r\nMaybe you could start there...\r\n\r\nQ\u2122 Says: It's

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions\u2026\r\n\r\nI'm thinking it probably is a custom
    non-retail face, but was hoping someone might know more details about it either
    way.\r\n\r\nI considered Keedy, but upon inspection found the proportions and
    features different enough to make me doubt that it's an altered version.\r\n\r\nHas
    anyone else spotted this style in use on any other Dunkin' Donuts material?"

  body: on closer inspection, it seems to be the heavy weight...

  body: "Ah, good eye.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the face isn't as interesting as I thought
    it would be. In fact, the lighter weights just look like hacked versions of VAG
    Rounded.\r\n\r\nOh well. Thanks for the ID!"
