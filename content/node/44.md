  I&#39;m not looking for a wood font, but one that looks as if one made letters out

    X. Solo. Also, I think Larabie might have a wood/log font, but don&#39;t quote
    me on it. <BR> <BR>www.larabiefonts.com <BR> <BR> <BR>bj '

    of the vast smorgasbord of enormous mostly-crap free font archives&#41; that fit
    your bill. &#34;Logger&#34; and &#34;Wood Badge.&#34; Great for invitations to
    Twin Peaks film festivals and so forth. <BR> <BR>I did a quick google search to
    find a site where one could download Logger, and found many a Boy Scouts of America
    page which had it up for download, interestingly &#40;for example: <A HREF="http://sne.tripod.com/clip.htm"
    TARGET="_top">http://sne.tripod.com/clip.htm</A> &#41;. I kept finding it only
    in PC.ttf form; if you&#39;re on a mac, you will either need to look harder than
    me or use a tt converter utility.'
