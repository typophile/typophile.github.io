  body: I do believe it's [[http://myfonts.us/td-eo9Paz|Avant-Garde]], some details
    can't lie (/C, /t, /s...). /1 is really not hard to reproduce, it could come from
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/std-demi-bold-oblique/glyphs.html#glyphs/541249/46|the
    half right part of /M]].
