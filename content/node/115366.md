body: "I'm looking for a programming font similar to Andale Mono.\r\n\r\nBut I'd like
  the font to be more \"square\" and \"strict/severe\" than Andale Mono. \r\n\r\nFor
  instance, the \"r\" in Andale Mono bends - and I'd prefer an \"r\" with a straight
  line. \r\n  \r\nWhich font would you recommend for a website design - a programming
  font similar to Andale Mono but more \"square/harsh/severe/cold/technical-looking\"?\r\n\r\nAnd
  with few round - bending - or ornamental details :)\r\n\r\nI'd be grateful for any
  and all recommendations - thanks a lot!\r\n\r\n(The 10 programming fonts listed
  at: http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts\r\n\r\nall have rounded
  shapes either in the \"r\"' or the \"l\"-letters.  \r\n\r\nOf those 10 fonts, I
  prefer Andale Mono because it does not look overtly \"designed\" - I like its cold,
  machine-like feel - but it's still not perfect :)\r\n"

    that Bob linked to matches your criteria, you might consider commissioning a modification
    of a font that's the closest to your ideals.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
