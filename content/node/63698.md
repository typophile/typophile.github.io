body: "Hi all!\r\n\r\nIm working on a brochure for a new ferry company that is supposed
  to have the fastest diesel powered ferry in the world.\r\n\r\nThe company wants
  to communicate the feeling of luxury and elegance, but in a more friendlier manner
  as opposed to high end, since the target audience is predominately locals. Its supposed
  to be inviting and fresh! ( I dare show u the previous brochure, u wont believe
  it!!)\r\n\r\nI've come up with a few layouts in which I used Myriad Pro for the
  headlines and I've experimented with using Sabon MT and Aldine 401 BT for the body
  text ( I didn't use them together, I'm trying 2 different options)\r\n\r\nI've included
  2 spreads for you all to look at, any suggestions regarding type would be much appreciated.
  ive still got some tweaking to do, sorting out the orange block stripes, type treatments
  etc,\r\n\r\nI also need some advice on the typeface for the tag line as what they
  came up with before is hideous.\r\n\r\nThe tag line is: Cruising with Nature which
  i will be placing at the front of the brochure. I've including 2 typefaces that
  are along the lines of what im looking for but not quite. \r\n\r\nITC Kabel BT:
  i like the round forms but im not too keen on the angle of the e and the the letter
  g.\r\nGeometric Slabserif 712 BT: i like these letterforms because theeres something
  nautical/ 'travel loggy' about them.\r\n\r\ni thought about using Garamond, but
  that looks too must of a classy serif.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated.
  Again i want it to look modern, elegant and inviting. The previous design had 2
  graphic waves underneath the text which i might implement but in better way, the
  previous design was too harsh looking and the colors wrong.\r\n\r\nthanx in advance!"

  body: "their logo is extremely crap. i cant hide the fact that it is a piece of
    monstrosity.\r\n\r\nIt is basically a sail, but it looks more like a boomerang,
    with the color combo white,green and red. With the name of the company at the
    bottom.\r\n\r\nIts very cheap looking. its even got that photoshop glare effect.
    \r\n\r\nI dont think it a good representation of the company and doesnt encompass
    their ethos at all, but i cant change it, so im pretty much stuck with it and
    in terms of the color combo i used in the design, the logo stick out like a soar
    thumb! \r\n\r\ni dont even know what type they are using, other than it adds to
    the ugliness."

  body: "It's a ferry, not a cruise ship, right? So the value proposition is speed--the
    luxury part is just gravy. Also, since the power comes from old-school fossil
    fuel, \"Cruising with Nature\" is a bit of an oxymoron. \r\nI think the text and
    the visuals ought to convey the message, <em>You'll get to your destination sooner,
    and while you're waiting to get there, look at how comfortable the ride will be,
    with lots of nice amenities!</em> (Coffee, wi-fi, etc.)\r\n"

  body: "Yup, its a ferry PublishingMojo, whose soul purpose is to connect the main
    city to small coastal regions, increase tourism etc. Along the way the view is
    spectacular so that is something i want to capitlize on in terms of photographs.
    You cant really tell but the front cover is a based on the idea of looking out
    of the ferry's window, if you pull the slip you will get a series of images through
    the window.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on type?"

  body: "Ah, I missed the point about the small pic being on a slider in a die-cut
    window. I like that idea, but suppose instead of having a blank wall around the
    window, you used a photo of some happy travelers enjoying their ride while they
    look out at the spectacular views?\r\nTwo thoughts about type. The first one is
    purely subjective. The Kabel and slab-serif options both look too industrial to
    me. I would try something a little warmer, but still elegant, like Albertus/Friz
    Quadrata. \r\nThe second type comment is purely practical. Travel-themed brochures
    are often displayed in racks at airports, car-rental offices, hotels, gift shops,
    etc., where the bottom half is covered up by the brochures on the next lower tier.
    If your ferry brochure will be distributed this way, you should put your headline
    at the top. "

  body: "awesome type recommendations PublishingMojo! thanx! \r\nAs i understood,
    the brochures will be distributed at expos on stands and possibly distributed
    through the mail, so yes the tagline 'Cruising with Nature' should probably go
    on top. I like the idea of adding a photo on the front cover, ill definately try
    that out.\r\n\r\n Im putting the logo on the back due to its hideousness and blocky
    shape it will ruin the whole look of the front cover. Like i mentioned early it
    is very badly designed and i cant do anyting about it, therefore im choosing to
    work with the headline to grab the audiences attention.\r\n\r\nWhat do u think
    of the typefaces for inside? Myriad Pro for subheading and Sabon for bodytext.
    I feel it works quite well, gives an overall clean, contemporary feel thats elegant
    and approachable.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Although it\u2019s a great typeface, you see it everywhere. <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/13281\">Here</a>\u2019s
    a thread with a lot of suggestions. <a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/lisboa\">Lisboa</a>
    is one of my favourites.\r\n\r\nLikewise, Sabon seems more appropriate for a novel.
    I\u2019d look for something that doesn\u2019t intend to be so silent."

    good sans in there i might consider purchasing, some are way too expensive unfortunately
    but there are some pretty good ones at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nthere was another
    list on that page for modern serifs, I thought something like whitman looks pretty
    neat but at this rate ive been looking at so many serifs on my hard drive everything
    looks the same! im going to revist  tmrw."

  body: Will the brochures be self-mailers, or mailed in an envelope? Here in the
    States, the postal regulations are very detailed and strict about the aspect ratio
    of an item to be mailed, and about any irregular edges (such as the thumb cut
    for the slider) that could jam high-speed sorting machines. Mail pieces that don't
    comply with regulations must pay high postage premiums. If your brochure will
    be a self-mailer, research the UK postal regulations and make sure your design
    doesn't get your client stuck paying higher postage.

  body: "thanks for DL on postal regulations PublishingMojo, im on it!\r\n\r\nI just
    came across Ocean Sans Pro [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/ocean_sans_pro_extra_bold_italic/]]\r\nand
    i think it is peeeerfect for the brochure's heading+subheadings. I was a bit skeptical
    when i read the name but its actually pretty good. in italic form its got a great
    sense of movemenent which i need to convey. again i rarely use italics cos i think
    it looks a bit naff, but in this case its pretty damn good.\r\n\r\nnow im deliberating
    whether to use a serif or sans for the body text. im thinking of using a sans
    serif because i think with the new headline face itll work a whole lot better
    \ and the whole page will look fresh and modern. I'm not sure tho, im stuggling
    to find something suitable. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is as close to what i want. \r\n\r\nBasically i really like the rounded forms
    and thin strokes and think it works quite well with the Ocean Sans headline typeface
    + plus make the overall text block night and spacious, easy to read. I dont like
    the sharp serifs and the cut off e tail.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations on a similiar
    typeface that has softer serifs but still retains the elegance of itc serif gothic

  body: thanx PublishingMojo, ITC Clearface looks alright but for some reason i feel
    like it doesnt say modern. There is somethng about all the serifs ive been trying
    out, it just makes the page look old. I want to communicate contemporary elegance,
    speed, freshness. Thats why i think maybe a san serif is a better option, or something
    like ITC Serif Gothic bt

    camera and get them original... warm colors are more inviting than cool ones.
    \r\n\r\nas for speed, lines and dots i think would work well, and i'd experiment
    with a bolder sans serif font as well (just to see if it works)"

  body: "How about using something like Serpentine Italic, it gives you modern and
    motion in one face.  It has a spur serif, but keeps the clean modern lines of
    most contemporary sans serif faces.  And you can change a part of a letter such
    as the bowl or even the dot on an \"i\" to be something else, maybe a maple leaf
    or something similar, possibly even smoke coming off the \"i\" trailing to the
    left to help show motion.\r\nJust thoughts from the cheap seats."

    doesnt have similiar serifs to ITC Serif Gothic tho, something with a smoother
    curve. \r\n\r\nishbog - i totally agree with u! photos are extremely important
    esp since ppl pay attention to them in brochures and not so much the words. ive
    sourced some great ones and will be art directing the photographer next week.\r\n\r\nfontgeek
    - i feel like that font is a bit too sporty, more suitable for a sport boat than
    a ferry. i feel like ocean sans is alot more elegant and less geometric in comparision,
    more fluid. Serpentine defo has motion in it tho and u illustrative suggestions
    could work.\r\n\r\nive taken a break from the project for 2 days and will be on
    it again tmrw, needed a breather! will let u know what changes i make. appreciate
    all the suggestions and help from u guys!"
