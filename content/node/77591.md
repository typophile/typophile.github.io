  print and online use, and was curious to know how well the webfont versions of the
  FF Scala and FF Scala Sans work? I've been trying to dig up examples of their use
  online, but I am unfortunately coming up a bit short. \r\n\r\nFF has a few examples
  on it's Flickr page, but does anybody know of any better examples?\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be appreciated!"
