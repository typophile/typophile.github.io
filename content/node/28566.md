body: What is a decent printer for typeproofing nowadays? Are there some classic B/W-lasers,
  or are the new ones always better?

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nHad just the same question. I use a 600dpi printer which has a
    1200dpi optimization, but I think this is just a printer specific 'hinting' thats
    going on inside the print engine. If I print 10pt size text, with normal paper,
    I can see the printer 'roping' and 'pixelating' things up. \r\n\r\nI was wondering
    if by using special paper / sheet material, proofreading could be enhanced. \r\n\r\ne-Baying
    a Linotronic is probably a step too far in my case...\r\n\r\nSebastian"

  body: "There were praises for HP LaserJet 5000 in some old threads. My former job
    had it and I remember it had very sharp and clean output. I wonder if the 4000
    is as reliable? It has smaller sheet size atleast but that's fine with me.\r\n\r\nI
    am on Mac and looking for real 1200dpi monochrome output for under 500USD. Speed
    doesn't matter. I am sceptical about brand new machines, but also afraid of coming
    across some compatibility issues with pre-USB/OSX-printers...\r\n\r\nI used to
    have some Minolta-Qms that had dirty output and I don't even know what the real
    resolution was. The manufacturers don't want us to know such things. \r\n\r\nNo
    Linotronic for me either, this time atleast.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should have posted
    on general discussion..."

  body: "Depends on what you are \"proofing\" for. If it is for the color the type
    will have when printed offset, I don't know of any. Our old HP 8100 comes much
    closer than our newer Xerox 5500 (the 5500 is way too dark). But even the old
    HP is too dark; I use it to print out patch corrections when a publisher is preparing
    a new edition by shooting tearsheets. It is a pretty good match for this, which
    means the type  it prints is far too heavy to evaluate as type would appear when
    printed with direct-to-plate offset printing.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you
    are proofing for character fit, I guess the highest true resolution you can find
    would be best. I've given up on  laser printres for fine-tuning character fit
    (for fonts for offset printing)."

  body: "I've done really well with my cheap Konica-Minolta. HP laser printers are
    pretty much always classic, although I've never used the sub-$500 models. Xante
    printers have the best output I've ever seen, but lately they can't manage to
    keep up with the demand for toner.\r\n\r\nPaper makes a huge difference. I see
    the best laser output on crisp white smooth matte papers, which are of course
    the hardest thing to find. If you're just using generic copy paper or inkjet paper
    the tooth will still make 10pt and below look icky. \r\n\r\nVotopake paper makes
    any laser printer output look twice as nice, although it's really hard to find.
    I've been trying to find a small-quantity supplier lately, when I do I'll let
    you know. "

  body: "> real 1200dpi monochrome output for under 500USD\r\n\r\nI recently went
    looking for exactly that, and found an HP for under $200! It's called the LaserJet
    1022. They also have a two-sided-printing version for $400. But people say HP's
    PS emulation is not so good (although it sounds like outputting your fonts with
    hinting disabled overcomes the problem).\r\n\r\nOne word of caution though, and
    the reason I haven't bought anything yet:\r\nin the end 1200dpi is simply not
    good enough - you really need 2400dpi.\r\nErgo: Xante. Expensive.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
