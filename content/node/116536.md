body: "In looking at the names of URW's fonts, I see they follow a naming standard,
  but I was stuck in trying to decipher all the versions.\r\nThe typical letters are
  D, P, L, and E.\r\n\r\nI think D is Display, with tighter character and word spacing.
  P seems to be Poster, with even tighter spacing and a lighter weight in the characters.
  L, according to some Google searching, is Laser \u2014 width compatible with built-in
  Postscript fonts for use back in the bad old days. I have no idea what E is, however.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone shed any light onto this?"

    Display and Poster? 24pt-48pt, and 48pt and up maybe?"

  body: "The poster versions are unusual, because the diacritics overlap the capital
    letters, so they fit for tight headlines. I have seen it used in newspapers sometimes.
    I can't really see a use for them otherwise.\r\n\r\nFrom experience the difference
    between Display and Text are not very big. The display versions are spaced and
    kerned tighter, the letterforms are usually the same in both cuts (except in Bauer
    Bodoni, as far as I know)\r\nThe others can not really be compared to optical
    sizes, because the letterforms are not adjusted to smaller point sizes.\r\n\r\nI
    would not pay to much attention to it, actually."

    body: I'm going to be making some suggestions for the typography section of a
      company styleguide that already includes some URW "D" and "P" fonts, so I wanted
      get the lowdown on whether I should include instructions for them specifically.
      The P fonts are definitely thinner than their Text or Display counterparts,
      with even tighter letterspacing. D appears to be the same characters, just with
      tighter letterspacing, while the L versions are weird looking to my eye (which
      makes sense if they were merely going to be subbed out when sent to a printer
      with embedded fonts).
