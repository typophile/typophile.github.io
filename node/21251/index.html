<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've been tasked with laying out a 20-page booklet in Chinese. The Word file I received has every paragraph indented. When I asked my client about not indenting the initial paragraph after a heading, she responded that, more or less, was "just how it's done in China." She's not a designer and knows nothing about typography.
So, my question is: Should all paragraphs be indented (including the first one after a heading), or can I follow my standard procedure and only indent all but the first? I would really like to get a second (or third or fourth) opinion on this before I violate one of my cardinal rules of text layout. If it turns out that this *is* "just how it's done," then I'll live with it. I won't like it much, but I'll live with it.
Thanks for your help with this.

<div class=commentbody>We once did a catalogue for the universal exhibition in Japan (Aichi 2005).
Hyphenation and/or linebreaks are handled in a completely different way in those languages, which the north american/european version of InDesign doesn't handle correctly.
So you have 2 options:
a) buy and install a chinese version of InDesign (or Quark) ... we didn't go for that route, so I can't guarantee it'll provide you with professional results.
b) Consider requesting the help of a professional translation Studio, you'll obviously need to ask your client to pay for that additional budget, but it is definitely the most professional setup which will guarantee that you'll be safe throughout the project: Just imagine that the client asks you ponctual corrections once the all the design is done, it'll be VERY difficult to do these as a none Chinese speaking person.
We found a good office here in Paris ... they actually work directly in InDesign or Xpress so you can just do your design as you'd normally do (with the text stripped from linebreaks) and then you just hand them the InDesign files and they do the corrections directly in the doc and return it to you.

<div class=commentbody>I did several things for a government corporation in Japanese and Chinese. We used InDesign CS on a Mac and didn't have a problem with it. We used one of the mac fonts (Hei, I believe). We hired a translation company in Ottawa that handled doing the translation and they sent back word files we coped and pasted directly into InDesign them to check out PDF proofs. It worked out well, just make sure the fonts are outlined when you go to print.
As far as I can recall we did not indent any paragraphs. I can double check and ask my old agency if you'd like. </div>
