    impressed by the non-seriffed 'n' etc alternates and the round 'a' which in combination
    turn Hypatia into a 'better Futura', a clear and at the same time minutely playful
    geometric sans. (In German I'd speak of 'leiser humor' -- 'quiet humor'.)

    solution that Thomas used for the Udieresis on the Black weight, which has historical
    precedents, as he told me.\r\nAlthough this feature is most suitable for when
