  body: 'Hi Addison, <BR> <BR>just a couple of spontaneous thoughts as they come to
    my mind: <BR> <BR>1&#41; First off, is that a comma after &#34;catering&#34;?
    <BR> <BR>2&#41; Personally, I&#39;m not too much fond of off the peg letters along
    curves &#40;it&#39;s something different with handmade letters&#41; and the combination
    with an cursive-all-caps-with-expert-T&#39;s setting doesn&#39;t tend to have
    me change my mind. To me, especially the cursives seem too much in combination
    with the arced text. The T&#39;s as such are nice. The curved text does look less
    serious than the straight one. <BR> <BR>3&#41; I&#39;m a bit undecided about whether
    the sharp, high-contrast letters &#40;&#34;Enviting Events&#34;&#41; go good together
    with the uniform stroke width and the sketchy freehand feeling of the graphic.
    They might, I think. I guess I&#39;m just not too happy with the letters - for
    some reason I don&#39;t yet know how to elaborate. <BR> <BR>jpg'

  body: I was looking at the E in Edwardian Script Alternates and <BR>thought, hmmm.
    <BR> <BR>You have two words that start with E, maybe you can <BR>use that in conjuring
    up something. <BR> <BR>The red brackets distract, imo. &#40;because of the color
    change.&#41; <BR> <BR>Also, you might take a look at some flourishes, such as
    the ones <BR>that accompany Bickham Script. <BR> <BR>I think you could do something
    flourish-ish with a spoon <BR>and fork, etc. <BR> <BR>bj <BR>

  body: That is a comma after catering, and I suppose I don&#39;t need it. Thanks.
    <BR> <BR>The serif type is Storm&#39;s Antique Moderne, and I was going for contrast
    between the type and the mark -- kind of an eclectic feel I guess &#40;and I&#39;m
    a sucker for those swash Ts&#41;. Perhaps a type that relates better to the graphic
    will do the trick... I&#39;ll try some things. <BR> <BR>Sorry I didn&#39;t mention
    before -- they specifically wanted to stay away from &#34;swirly and frilly.&#34;
    I&#39;ve explored some options with the two Es and wasn&#39;t happy, but I&#39;ll
    revisit those sketches. Thanks for the type links, Bickham is one of my favorites.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try to post some more options tonight. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your
    advice, <BR>Addison

    the logo is nice. However, the clean formal type &#43; hard-line frame conflicts
    with the casual illustration. I&#39;d suggest removing both the frame and the
    brackets, as they are just extraneous and distract from the type and mark...the
    two items that should be the focus.'

    <BR>I know. One of the women has an MBA and insists that &#34;Enviting&#34; makes
    the name more unique and memorable. On top of that, she likes it because E comes
    before I in the yellow pages. How can you argue with that? <BR> <BR>I appreciate
    your comments, Darrel. I need to simplify. <BR> <BR>-Addison

- author:
    name: rking
  body: Hi Addison <BR> <BR>I think the drawing is perfect and I would keep it. I
    also like the type choice &#40;the second arrangement, not the type on a curve&#41;
    and the contrast of styles between the casual graphic and the formal type. I think
    this works because the people planning these kind of events &#40;your client&#39;s
    customers&#41; are going for this combination of casual elegance in their parties.
    &#40;Although that&#39;s just a guess because I&#39;m definitely not part of that
    world.&#41; <BR> <BR>Either element by itself would be either too casual or too
    formal, but combined they really play off each other nicely.  <BR> <BR>The graphic
    also has a soft, &#34;girly&#34; kind of vibe which I think would appeal to the
    kind of person planning parties like this. <BR> <BR>The frame around the outside
    of the whole thing -- I don&#39;t see how it adds anything. I thought maybe that
    was to indicate the edge of a business card &#40;is it?&#41;. <BR> <BR>The brackets
    around the second statement add an element of whimsy that I think works here.
    I might think about colors other than black and red. Maybe if the red wasn&#39;t
    so bright but more of a burgandy, which might look good paired with a gray &#40;instead
    of the black&#41;. <BR> <BR>Overall I think you are very close to a really nice
    solution for your target audience. <BR> <BR>Rob <BR> <BR>

    a more youthful look and seems to better represent the three women starting the

    I had explored the Es in purely typographic ways as well as with silverware and
    the envelope/invitation idea, but nothing seemed to click. However, I appreciate
    your sketches, they got my wheels turning again. I&#39;m going to sleep on it.
    <BR> <BR>The red color was their suggestion -- they wanted bold. I suppose it
    will help separate them from the muted pastels and Martha Stewart colors that
    dominate most of that profession. Any ideas? <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the final for

  body: Very good. This type treatment is the only one so far that manages to make
    the spelling look deliberate, as opposed to simply ignorant. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t
    work with people like that. I would be unable to resist including a version that
    said &#34;&#40;sic&#41;&#34; in the middle.

    It&#39;s been extremely helpful. <BR> <BR>As far as working with difficult clients,
    I&#39;ve had some real hum-dingers. It&#39;s hard not be offending sometimes while
    trying to be helpful. With these women, for instance, my strongest complaint was
    people who only hear the name won&#39;t be able to find them -- they will look
    under &#34;i&#34; in the yellow pages instead of &#34;e&#34;. Their name will
    eventually become, &#34;Enviting Events spelled with an e instead of an i.&#34;
    But it was their idea and they do not want to let go of it. It&#39;s frustrating.

    The only suggestion would be to try bumping up the weight of both the illustration

    &#39;hit&#39; hard enough on press. '

    a pastel emboss or stamp. The contrast between the gloss of the logo and the  matte
    of the paper would be dramatic. Ask your local printer if he/she can get a sample
    to show your clients, also contact a paper company like Strathmore. '

  body: Not that this matters, because you&#39;ve eliminated the brackets, but I don&#39;t
    think they were necessary to begin with. The smaller size already implies the
    fact that it is describing what &#34;Enviting Events&#34; does. Brackets can be
    lovely and can also add to a design, but I think in this instance that were superfluous.
    <BR> <BR>Good choice on the type, and I also agree with Stephen&#39;s comments
    about needing a bolder version for smaller sizes. Your printer is going to have
    a coronary trying to get this type to print at small sizes. <BR> <BR>Does the
    apex on your envelope need further visual description?

- author:
    name: addison
  body: Tiffany, <BR> <BR>I do need to fine-tune the weights of the mark and the type
    -- Eric Sans is very light, definitely a display type. I may use Gill Sans for
    the the &#34;Weddings, Catering &amp; Event Planning.&#34; Does anyone think it&#39;s
    possible to stroke the type to get the right weight and then finalize it in outlines?
    &#40;Does that make sense?&#41;  I&#39;m hesitant to modify the points and curves
    &#34;manually&#34; because of the subtle tapers -- I&#39;m afraid of screwing
    it up. <BR> <BR>The apex of the envelope is pretty much a dot right now. Does
    it need some polishing? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Addison

  body: Addison, if you are using Adobe Illustrator you can easily add another stroke
    in the Appearances menu and it won&#39;t hurt your type. You don&#39;t need to
    play with the points or curves.

  body: but after stroking, be sure to expand the outlines to the final end-result
    is solid figures. Nothing annoys me more than having to make modifications to
    someone else&#39;s identity files only to find that the original designer created
    all the weights with varying strokes.
