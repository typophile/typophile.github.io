body: "In emigre 43 was an issue about beautiful typefaces, by rudy vanderlans. The
  attach image let you see the part of the typeface that I wonder about. The footnotes
  on the image say\xB4s \"Designer unknown\", but say something about \"Special Effects
  and Topical Alphabets\" by Dan X. Solo.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wAPQ3kwAw0s/T2z5eu1YiPI/AAAAAAAABD0/2toAsGI16q0/s1600/Captura%2Bde%2Becr%25C3%25A3%2B-%2B2012-03-23%252C%2B22.19.02.png\"><strong>Emigre#43[beautiful_typefaces]</strong></a>----><em>link</em>\r\n(attach
  method doesn't work, I don't know why)\r\n\r\nI already search about the names highlighted
  in the footnotes, but nothing match.\r\n\r\nID this one for me\r\nThanks \r\nF\xE1bio

  body: "In \"The Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Typefaces\" this is identified
    merely as \"Rustic\"., as it is in the Special Effects and Topical Alphabets book.\r\n\r\nWhile
    there are many similar fonts, there are only two known digitizations of this particular
    face:\r\n\r\nRusticBlackShadow, by \"Character\"  (so named to differentiate it
    from the plain and white shadow versions)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nFA204, by Dick Pape
    (his copyright notice attributes the font to Pepin Press, because that's where
    he found the image to work from).\r\n\r\nBoth of these are free. Character's version
    is more easily found.\r\n\r\nSome version of the ClickArt package included 43
    characters as .wmf files; this is probably what Character converted into his font."
