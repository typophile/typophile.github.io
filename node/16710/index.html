  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,

I just read an interesting post in another list I'm on and it raised the question as to what the best fonts would be to use in situations where people need very high character recognition. The situation given was in the use of serial numbers which have to be read from packaging and transcribed into a webpage for registration purposes - as a related aside the poster stated that their company has given up using ambiguous forms such as I, 1 and 0 in this context.

For some reason this question struck me as incredibly interesting, and got me wondering about things like vehicle registration plates and emergency signs. Does anyone have any pointers to good resources on the matter, opinions, or even some good practical suggestions.

Thanks.

		<div class="commentbody">I just read recently about a (European ?) country that redesigned the typeface for their license plates to make it impossible for people to change certain glyphs into other ones. Like making an 'F' into an 'E' by adding a stroke across the bottom. 

Hm... need to work on those memory skills. I can't recall where I read that. And the article had pictures, too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're thinking of Germany:

http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/FE-Schrift

There *was* a neat Flash movie out there demonstrating how it foiled any attempts at glyph modification, but it appears to be gone now.

The Netherlands also modified their character set recently:

http://www.dafont.com/en/font.php?file=kenteken

LineTo do a line of number plate fonts as well:

http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Categories/Headline+Fonts/Numberplate/

In the US, of course, different jurisdictions use different die sets. Pennsylvania, for example, uses numerals slightly taller than letters.  

Most places just choose to avoid the problem altogether: combinations with 'I', 'O', and 'Q' are skipped, even if the dies are reasonably easy to differentiate. 

Texas just said 'the heck with it' and chucked all vowels on passenger-car plates. Florida used to skip 'I', 'O', and 'Q' in potentially confusing parts of their numbering system, but now uses them indiscriminately. This causes a raft of potential problems, especially because (a) especially with their die set, those glyphs are pretty tough to tell apart at a distance, and (b) their numbering system has devolved into chaos, so you don't really know for sure where the letters and numbers 'should' be anymore. (I'm exaggerating, but not much.)

I've collected plates for twenty years now, so I can be [even more] exquisitely boring on the subject. Drop me a line and I can point you to more resources.

Germany -- yes, that's it. 
Thank you, Nick! 

I think that 'O' is such an odd egg-shaped thing. Must admit that I really enjoy the number set, too.</div>

Hmmm, then you should consider getting into text font design!  :-)
Assuming you haven't already...

One good place to look for insights into the "recognition conflicts" of letters is the research of Herman Bouma; he has created some quite interesting graphs that use distance lines to indicate conflicts. My own "Modules & Similars" diagram is the same sort of thing, altough it addresses immersive reading, not (just) letterwise recognition:

The German plate font, I adore adore adore.
