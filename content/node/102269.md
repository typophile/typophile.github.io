  & Printing Museum.\" I found it at http://smumn-cn.blogspot.ca/2010/08/case-of-wood-type-from-hamilton-wood.html.\r\nIt
  looks like a variation on ATF's  Binner [Cumming 1898, patented by Phinney D30253
  in 1899]. But the leg of R terminates with a swoop to a big vertical wedge instead
  of a tapering brush style stroke. ATF's Binner is sans serif while this has tiny
  serifs like Inland's Corbitt [1900]. The Beak on G and the tail on Q ares flared.
  Other letters probably also differ in detail, but they are not shown in the image.\r\nI
  do not have ready access to Rob Roy Kelly's American Woodtype but could consult
  a copy at major galley library if this design is included in his collection  of
  specimens.\r\nI would very much appreciate your help in identifying the font [perhaps
  it is unnamed but has a Hamilton font number?] and finding a more complete character
  set, whether in Kelly or elsewhere.\r\nThank you.\r\nDon\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WoodtypeSimilarBinner_5429.jpg]"

    Rob Roy Kelly's book shows a number of examples where this is the case. This was
    also true in the instance of the inspiration for my font Matamoros NF, which is
    similar to the typeface shown, with a few exceptions, most notable the Os\u2026"

    body: "Thanks Nick. I like your variation on Binner with its flavor of Inland's
      Inland in the serpentine O and elsewhere. I read Rob Roy Kelly's book several
      years ago and noted that named woodtype fonts were the exception. I take it
      from your post that the book does not include a face that is a close match to
      this one.  Someday I should visit the Hamilton Wood Type & Printing Museum to
      see what they have that is not available as specimen images online or published
      by Kelly or otherwise.\r\nDon"
