body: "I've been working on it for years, and recently pretty much gone into a cave
  to try to finish it, and, at long last, it's nearly ready. I finally have a reasonably
  complete draft of my PhD thesis on interpolating splines.\r\n\r\nIt's quite technical,
  and I'm not expecting too many people to follow along. Even so, I hope it gets across
  some of my motivation. Even though I hope the splines are useful in many applications,
  my primary reason for doing the work is to have a better tool for creating fonts.
  Also, I hope it gets across how deeply I have gone into the literature and theory.\r\n\r\nThe
  draft (in a compact format, not the actual thesis template) is here: http://levien.com/phd/frame.pdf\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone is inclined do detailed critique, chapters 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 are in near-final
  form. There's some reorganizing to be done of the elastica material, and integrating
  the results on the generator curve from the CAD paper. But overall I think it's
  pretty coherent. I'm excited!\r\n\r\nThanks to people here for expressing interest
  in the work, and responding to various queries and surveys I've thrown out over
  the years.\r\n"

    tomorrow.  I figure you're not looking much for comments now in terms of general
    content and organization, so anything in particular \u2014grammar, presentation,
    intelligibility by laypeople\u2014 you want us to keep an eye out for?  It's the
    least we can do for bringing us spiro :)"

  body: I enjoyed chapters 5 and 6, but didn't read them closely enough yet to offer
    critique.  I'll try to get back to you in a week or two when I have more free
    time.

  body: "Impressive work, Raph. I enjoyed the little chapter on real splines. There
    is a wooden boat building school on my island, and I'm now inspired to go down
    and look at their splines.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the history of the elastica was
    fascinating."

  body: "Thanks so much for the kind words - it helps to hear as I'm on the final
    stretch.\r\n\r\n@guifa: I think what would be most helpful right now is identifying
    parts that are unclear or don't make much sense. Obviously if it says \"todo\"
    or has ***'s, I already know about it, but I fear there passages that might have
    gotten munged in cut-and-paste, or older text that no longer makes much sense
    in context of newer work.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: Interesting stuff, will have a read through properly. You might already know
    section 2.1.1 (p5) ends mid-sentence?

  body: One thing that was a bit confusing was that chapter 3 referred repeatedly
    to equation 5.10, making the reader do a little non-linear run-around.  Maybe
    the order of the chapters was reversed from an earlier version?

  body: Figure 2.7 also needs more explanation (a style of diagram used repeatedly
    later on).  It's possible to figure out what it represents, but at first glance
    it's not clear what the points are or what the relation of top to bottom graphs
    is, especially since all the curvature definitions come in chapter 3.

    closely when some of the balls I'm trying to keep in the air clear up.
