  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Apparently I am not going to use some manage software for my font.

Now I am weighing cons and pros.

Each way has its advantages, and I have to choose one, but one thing is clear that not every font has a foundry. Those free fonts are hard to trace its origins I guess.

Any idea?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Personally, organizing by foundry does me little good. When I'm looking for a font to use for a project I'm much more likely to think "what's a good condensed sans serif?" than "I wonder if anything from H&FJ would work for this project". I think you should consider your own criteria - I realize a lot of typophiles do organize by foundry. The only two foundries that I have "sets" for in my Font Explorer are House Industries and Emigre, both of which (to me) have a pretty distinct personality. Plus your themes can extended beyond serif and sans serif to categories that might work better for you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Organizing by foundry helps in some situations, but not ones directly related to selecting designs.  If you've purchased/acquired fonts with varying licenses (e.g.: free fonts that are free for personal but not commercial use), the terms of the licenses might be a better search criteria. This will sometimes correlate to the foundry they come from, though not reliably so. Still, some foundries include a license brief in the copyright line (not a full EULA, just a statement) and this can be helpful.

		<div class="commentbody">Once upon a time I organized my fonts like Patty, but then Suitcase gagged and I lost it and I have yet to go back. Since that time I've organized by foundry. Why? Because foundries generally have a style and/or quality that represents the lot of their work. Jason's mention of EULA also is important (to me). </div>
