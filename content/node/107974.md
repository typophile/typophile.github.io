  but any pointers would be hugely helpful and much appreciated.\r\n\r\nI've just
  started working for a film director. We're currently putting together the poster
  for a film that's just been completed and he asked me to do research into gothic
  fonts.\r\n\r\nThis research landed on the Sonatine font - http://www.mauvais-genres.com/4550-thickbox/sonatine-japanese-movie-poster-93-beat-takeshi-kitano.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nThis
  is the now the favoured direction, but I've started to come up against a brick wall
  looking for variants.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I used up all my researching option getting
  to Sonatine and haven't now got many idea's on where or how or what variants on
  the font might be out there.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that some people with more font
  knowledge than me might be able to help a bit, and it really would be amazing if
  any one reading this might know of any other fonts a bit like Sonatine (american
  text) or anywhere which might be good place to start looking.\r\n\r\nAs I've been
  through myfonts, font shop etc looking my only real ideas now are to go to book
  shops and look for 70/80's fiction and see if they might have any futuristic/gothic
  fonts which might work for the film.\r\n\r\nSo really if anyone know of any fonts
  like Sonatine that would incredible and thank you for taking the time to read this.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany
  Thanks,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi, thanks John - but unfortunately I did actually know it was american text,
    I was kinda just looking for pointers to similar fonts - or something a bit off
    piste or interestingly linked. \r\n\r\nit's probably a bit unlikely to find something
    I guess"

  body: "FYI, the typography term for the general style is \"blackletter\" (\"gothic\"
    has other meanings). Mind you, this is a sort of simplified blackletter, not a
    common form of the style.\r\n\r\nDo a search on myfonts.com and use \"simple blackletter\"
    and \"clean blackletter\" and you get quite a few alternatives. Most of these
    seem plausible:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/volcano/trigot/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/volcano/black-sirkka/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/gryffensee/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/Backstein/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/otto-maurer/freiheit/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/volcano/domstadt/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/leather/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/san-marco/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/zimple/\r\n"

    on Dafont; seems to be quite old (1991 at the latest).
