  Wrap packaging. Any idea? Looks like a super compressed cut of Clarendon.\r\n\r\n
  Any idea to the closest digital version of this that we can use/purchase?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Reynolds_Wrap_60s_6546.jpg]"

  body: 'Looks like it''s based on Egyptian Bold Condensed, probably custom as was
    normal for product labels/logos at that time. (The lowercase <strong>r</strong>
    has definitely been modified.) '
