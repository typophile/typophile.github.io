  answer.\r\n\r\nI'm using the beautiful face of 'Cooper Std Black' for a current
  project.\r\nI've roughed everything out in Photoshop CS, using this lovely font
  - but upon starting work in Flash, the font appears not to exist on my PC. \r\n\r\nI'm
  a self taught fly-by-my-pants Flash user so I may well have missed something technical,
  but unfortunately important.\r\n\r\nAny ideas, I'm puzzled?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in
  advance of your help.\r\n\r\n:)"

  body: It could be where the font is installed. Is that possible on a PC? Can you
    install fonts specifically for Adobe Apps?

  body: "Mmmm,\r\n\r\nI've been having a scurry around - I can't really see any additional
    Adobe fonts, at least not within an Adobe program folder.\r\n\r\nI'll keep looking,
    it seems the most obvious answer, but it's locating the folder that's the niggling
    problem.......\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\nMmmm - I wonder where Flash draws it's fonts from,
    presumably the windows / font folder.\r\n\r\nStill looking, any help would make
    me happier............"

  body: On Mac OS, Adobe has some private font folders in various places. Fonts in
    those folders are only active in Adobe apps. Maybe this is true on Windows as
    well?

    - Cooper just isn't there. The adobe folder would show me Illustrator only fonts
    as well, I assume.\r\n\r\nWhere is the little blighter hiding then? I've tried
    a 'search' of the hardrive but I don't trust that little wagging dog one mite.\r\n\r\nMmmm.
    Plots and thickenings. I'm sure it's obvious and I'm being dumb.....\r\n\r\nCooper
    Std Black is an Open Type Font. If it was placed in the local fonts folder then
    it would only show up in Adobe programs, but it's not even in the local folder?!\r\n\r\nSorry,
    thinking out loud."

    finally, do I drop a copy of this into the Windows/font folder to make my day
    bright?"
