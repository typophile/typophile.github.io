  body: Not much [[FF Meta]] in this. This is a weird neo-grotesque (the classification
    of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/helvetica/?&sample_text=capuccino&sample_size=60">Helvetica</a>.
    The horizontal terminals are what set it apart from humanist sans serifs like
    Meta.

  body: Could be a "free" font. What's more peculiar to me are the very short descenders.

    the latin part of a CJK typeface."

  body: "It could be Heisei Kaku Gothic (\u5E73\u6210\u89D2\u30B4\u30B7\u30C3\u30AF),
    a Japanese font. See [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/dynacomware/dfhs_gothic_std_japanese_ot/?&sample_text=cappuccino%20%EF%BD%83%EF%BD%81%EF%BD%90%EF%BD%90%EF%BD%95%EF%BD%83%EF%BD%83%EF%BD%89%EF%BD%8E%EF%BD%8F|here]].
    The font is published by several foundries such as DynaComware, Ryobi and Adobe.
    The 1 byte latin characters of Adobe\u2019s version are based on Myriad, but The
    2 byte latin characters of Adobe\u2019s version match that sample. "

  body: "Hi guys. Well I was for sure wrong, haha. My noobieness shows!\r\n\r\nThe
    sample was found off of an album cover. The album was a limited production produced
    and designed by famous Japanese designer Hiroshi Fujiwara of Fragment.\r\n\r\nSo
    that makes me think that akira1975 might have the right answer. I'm off to check
    that out but I'm not sure I understood the difference between 1 byte and 2 byte
    latin characters?"

    linked to were different ;)\r\n\r\nThe one you linked to is definitely it! Thank
    you so much.\r\n\r\nSo pricey tho :'("

  body: "Expensive! I was not aware of that. Dynacomware\u2019s fonts are much cheaper
    in Japan. For example, they sells a font package including 100 fonts for about
    $360.\r\n[[http://store1.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1802.html|Adobe\u2019s version]]
    is more affordable. But note that that has two kinds of latin characters. One
    of the two is based on Myriad and the other one is the same as that of other foundries\u2019
    Heisei Kaku Gothic.\r\n"
