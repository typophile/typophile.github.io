  on the attachment. Dan X. Solo calls it \"Brawley\" but he did a lot of renaming
  so I guess that is not the real name of the typeface.\r\n\r\nAny information (name
  / designer / publisher / year) is welcome. Thanks in advance!\r\n"

  body: Thanks Nick, I know your gorgeous Joost A Gigolo font is similar but I still
    would like to get some information about the "Brothers Disco" typeface.

  body: "Thanks Bob, but the Solopedia is about listing names of digital revivals,
    not about listing the original names. Since the typeface I'm looking for originates
    from the film/phototype era the Solopedia is not very helpful.\r\n"

  body: Couldn't Buddy Esquire's other posters provide a clue to the origin? Or would
    he have shopped around for dry tranfer typefaces from different companies?

  body: "In an interview Buddy Esquire stated that he used Prestype transfer sheets
    for his flyers.\r\n\r\nTypefaces like Tick Tock (Solotype name) and a font that
    shares similarities with the fonts Grock (Monotype, 1935) and Roco (Collis Clements,
    Letraset, 1973) are shown on some of his other flyers. Don't know the origin of
    these faces either (also probably Prestype fonts).\r\n\r\nSo I'm still looking
    for more info on these fonts."
