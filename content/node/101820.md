body: "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt to get competent critique about
  my font. So please, Don\u2019t beat me up too hard :)\r\nI will be very appreciated
  about any critics and comments.\r\nMy first serif typeface I am trying to make a
  little bit retro, fashy, but contemporary.\r\nIt has 5 different serif shapes depending
  on the position of prominent parts of letters (maybe a little bit too complicated,
  but I like it).\r\nI know there are still many things to work on and improve, but
  the main parts I am really not sure about are sharp ends of stems. The stems are
  the only parts without any serifs and I guess it makes the whole face unusual.\r\nPlease
  look at PDF files attached below.\r\nI made the stems a little bit out of the baseline
  to prevent them to look shorter than next letters, but I think it still looks wired
  at large points. At sample \"i\" looks longer than next \"l\" and so on.. . May
  be I made them too sharp or too long? Is there any way to do not change the shape?
  Or may be I need to make the bottom parts of letters more consequent? Or it is Okay?\r\nI
  need your opinions.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and responce![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Half_Serif_3_sm_5567.jpg]"

  body: "Thank You for comments! \r\nI see You`re right about the same design of letters.
    Also I made changes of the \"R\" the same way. \r\nBut now there is a dilemma
    - which shape to use? \r\nWith the sharper one font looks even sharper, than it
    was before. And letter spacing seems more tight to me. \r\nI had tried  the rounded
    style instead, but  the rounded \"D\" almost looks like \"O\".\r\nWhat do you
    think, is the difference between the \"D\" and \"O\" noticeable enough to choose
    the rounded version? \r\n\r\nP.S. It would be great if anyone could comment the
    length of stems (problem described at the start of this topic, in PDF file). This
    is the main and the most important question for me. \r\nIf anyone can notice some
    more problems in this typeface, please, let me know!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_Rounded_5457.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_Sharper_3986.jpg]"

    closer to sans serif.

    body: "Than You for comment! \r\nI`m sorry for being so imprecise. Actually, You`re
      right, this is a hybrid.\r\nI just could`t find myself correct definition :)
      It really has some sans-serif and some serif letters, also there are some with
      both styles mixed. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I guess I found out the problem of these strange stems myself. Previously
    I made all the vertical strokes a little bit longer (out of the baseline) for
    visual balance. I wanted them to look optically the same length  as \"o\", \"s\",
    \"a\" etc.rounded letters, but I was wrong. \r\nNow I see, it`s better to make
    them all placed on baseline. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Illinois_5869.jpg]"

  body: It's the 'o' and other rounded glyphs that need to drop below the baseline
    and above the x-height to look optically even with the rest of the text.  Or possibly,
    because of the major differences between the stems of the el and n, for instance,
    there may be a need for specific ligatures for different combinations.

  body: I must disagree with HVB; given that the O has a flat bottom, it does not
    need to overshoot.

    on some ligatures now and hope to show them soon!
