  league here, that is pretty obvious as I read some of the postings, so this must
  be the right crowd to turn to for much needed advice. <BR> <BR>I am a studio manager
  for a medium sized Advertising agency based in Amsterdam. As with most Studios,
  we are seriously considering making the switch to InDesign. For now, one of the
  most compeling reasons to do this is that a very large multinational client of ours
  suffers when their materials are converted from English Masters  to local masters
  as the typographical attention we give to the materials is often lost when the text
  is simply translated and pasted back into a layout by a local agency which often
  strips away any of the typographical adjustments we have made. The worst results
  are when our mac based fonts are repaced by PC fonts which even in a straight conversion
  of the English Masters results in unwanted line breaks and terrible kerning.  <BR>
  <BR>I have heard that open fonts will help solve this problem but where in the world
  would I have this corporate typeface converted into an open type font?  <BR> <BR>This
  particular client reproduces work throughout the world, in over 20 languages using
  at least three different versions of their font which seems like another strong
  reason why open type sounds so interesting to me even if we stayed with our current
  layout application. <BR> <BR>So to make a very long question a bit shorter, where
  can I draw the line between the hype of the Adobe sales guys who are parading the
  open face type and InDesign flag and the reality of really  having more creative
  control over the final products that are produced in over 60 countries? Would open
  type help? Where would I find a passionate typographer that would not only convert
  the current fonts but actaully improve it?  <BR> <BR>Any help or advice would be
  grately appreciated! <BR> <BR>Thank you, <BR>Jim '

    I for one would not call Adobe&#39;s enthusiasm for OpenType hype. A well-constructed,
    feature-rich OpenType font working together with InDesign is a beautiful thing. '

  body: Hi Jim, <BR> <BR>It seems very much as if your workflow is busted, and this
    is what you need to fix. Certainly standardizing on a set of good, full-feature
    multilingual OpenType fonts and Adobe InDesign across your complete workflow,
    Windows and Mac, including the &#39;local agency&#39;, would be a good move, but
    there may be other ways to fix the problems.  <BR> <BR>Certainly if the Adobe
    Sales guy or someone else is suggesting that getting a few OpenType fonts will
    magically solve your process problems, they are over-selling the fonts.  <BR>
    <BR>As you&#39;re dealing with sixty languages you&#39;re probably going to hit
    on more than a few that InDesign will have trouble with. You probably want to
    have Adobe help identify these and work out a process specifically around them.
    Likewise with the fonts themselves, you&#39;re probably not going to find a single
    OpenType family that supports all the languages your customer cares about. <BR>
    <BR>Hope this helps,  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR> <BR>

  body: Another suggestion might be talking to other agencies/studios that deal with
    localization and see what has worked for them. How have they solved this same
    problem?

  body: It would be interesting and helpful to see the list of languages in question.
    On the plus side, InDesign supports more languages, better, than any other high-end
    DTP application. But it is still not a panacea for language support. For example,
    you&#39;re out of luck if you want to do any of the Indic languages &#40;short
    of sticking an EPS or PDF into your InDesign layout&#41;. <BR> <BR>I just spent
    40 minutes this morning &#40;at 7 am, ouch!&#41; in a teleconference with a major
    US newspaper chain discussing whether/when they should start moving to OpenType.
    I&#39;m happy to discuss these sorts of things with our customers, including in
    public. OpenType isn&#39;t perfect &#40;nothing is, really&#41;, but in most workflows
    it&#39;s an improvement, and often a very large one. <BR> <BR>Assuming you are
    also using InDesign and a Unicode-based text workflow, and that InDesign supports
    all the languages you need, at least some of your specific problems can be avoided
    by also using OpenType fonts. You can use the exact same font on both platforms,
    and your kerning and layout will be 100% identical on both Mac and Windows. <BR>

    solution is preferable. Hence the crass uniformity of global culture, and the
    derogation of local culture. <BR> <BR>Good typography requires a discriminating
    human presence, and that can never be replaced by &#34;smart&#34; software.  <BR>
    <BR>For example, there is no way that Quark or InDesign will EVER be able to make
    truly smart quotes &#40;&#34;Typographer&#39;s quotes&#34;&#41;! Stuff like &#34;rock
    &#39;n&#39; roll&#34; will always fool it. '

  body: Greetings Jim, <BR> <BR>InDesign can handle most languages based on the Latin
    alphabet, plus CJK stuff. The ME version adds Arabic and Hebrew. For Indic, a
    good start is the latest version of &#40;!&#41; Microsoft Publisher. I get the
    impression that the 60 languages you&#39;re talking about are mostly Latin script,
    though. <BR> <BR>If you have a set of custom corporate fonts, please feel free
    to contact me privately about OpenType conversion. &#40;<a href="mailto:john@eccentrifuge.com">john@eccentrifuge.com</a>&#41;
    If they were commissioned from a third-party designer, you will need that person&#39;s
    written permission up front.
