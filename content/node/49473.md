  is that swooshy thing called that falls below a word? They're common in baseball
  logotypes. See the link below for a reference.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.teesforall.com/images/Counting_Crows_Baseball_Logo_Blue_Shirt.jpg\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated, and even more greatly respected.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: I don't think there's a standard term, though sign painters might have a bit
    of lingo for it. I would call it an underline swash. I'll email [[John Downer]]
    who I'm sure will have something to say.

  body: "From John Downer:\r\n\r\nI don't know of any single standard term for exactly
    what you're asking, but\r\nany of the following terms would be understood by American
    sign painters:\r\n\r\n- swash underline\r\n- swash underscore\r\n- swash tail\r\n\r\nThe
    word \"flourish\" (or the word \"decorative\") can be substituted for \"swash\"\r\nwithout
    degrading the meaning."

  body: We call them tails at the screenprinter I work at, and it's actually kind
    of a nice exercise to make ones that match the features of whatever typeface you're
    using (what can I say? It's a boring, completely unchallenging job.)
