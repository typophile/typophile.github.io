    is what you&#39;re looking for, as the other option -  <BR><a href="http://www.lineto.com/"
    target="_blank"> Lineto</a>&#39;s Alpha Headline - is currently unavailable to
    the general  <BR>public. Mitsubishi Motors Europe acquired exclusive license for  <BR>the
    Alpha Headline fonts for the duration of ten years, expiring  <BR>at the end of
    2012.

    use of any blatant knock-offs you may find there.
