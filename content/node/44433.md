  condensed, compressed, maybe wide weights.\r\nJust something newer like Titling
  Gothic, KnockOut, a testosterone loaded male font.\r\nI hate Interstates ugly shapes.\r\n\r\nSadly
  Hoeflers Gotham does not have condensed, compressed fonts.\r\n\r\nMay anybody has
  a good tip.\r\n\r\nThank you"

    Gothic Condensed</a>, which smells like leather, racing, gamehall gambling and
    all those things real men do when they are unattended. But probably that\u2019s
    a little bit too much clich\xE9, right?"

    the traditional gothics, you might like [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans
    | Benton Sans]]. It has compressed and condensed and with the black styles it
    can be quite masculine.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Antenna | Antenna
    ]] could also do the trick. It's a Cyrus Highsmith font from 2007 and it seems
    to be the font of the moment showing up in more and more magazines every day.
