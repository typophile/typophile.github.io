  but keen to learn as part of the job.  I tend to use type for display, headlines,
  bullet points and logotypes.  I never work in print and I tend to use sans-serifs
  more than serifs.  The H+FJ fonts get used a lot.\r\n\r\nEvery month I get an email
  newsletter from MyFonts that shows all their latest and greatest faces, which is
  nice, although a lot of the brush / script styles I would probably never use.  But
  it's not an objective survey of all the best current font design, because not all
  foundries distribute on there.\r\n\r\nIs there somewhere on the web that is the
  BEST place to stay up to date, without being overwhelmed? Like motionographer.com
  is probably the best site for motion design. Seems obvious, but I haven't found
  it yet."
