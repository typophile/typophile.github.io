  from some of you with better knowledge of appropriate use of type in a resume.\r\n\r\nI
  have been working with piegnot light for my name/logo. I realize their is some level
  of subjectivity, but would you consider it to be too flashy for a resume?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help. I have to make a decision soon and just don't want to design around
  it if it's a bad idea from the start!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Peignot is very evocative of the 70s due to its association with The Mary
    Tyler Moore Show, and it does seem unconventionally decorative for a resume. A
    similarly stressed sans is Optima, which could be an alternative for you, I suppose.
