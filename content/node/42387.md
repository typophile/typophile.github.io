  body: "I dig the logo. Is there any significance to the little dip in the curve
    on the upper right portion of the icon? It's subtle, but distracting.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as Rockwell and Frutiger, can you post some examples of how you might use
    them together? \r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm very distracted by the inconsistent weight
    distribution among the Rockwell glyphs. Put a curvilinear lower case character
    between some with straight lines and you'll see what I mean. Lubalin Graph may
    be the better choice.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
