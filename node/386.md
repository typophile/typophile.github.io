body: Hey there, <BR> <BR>Hopefully someone can answer this one.. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  a graphic designer doing some freelancing <BR>for a book publishing company. So
  the question <BR>is, do they have to purchase the fonts from the <BR>font foundries
  for production? In other words, <BR>the fonts, would be purchased twice. &#40;Me
  and  <BR>the Book Co.&#41; or my purchase would be sufficient <BR>and they can use
  the fonts from me to print the job? <BR> <BR>Puzzled, <BR> <BR>dc <BR> <BR>

  body: Depends how much &#39;production&#39; they actually do. The license is usually
    for one location, and maybe for output/printing, depending on the foundry. If
    they&#39;ll do a lot of production work, not simply outputting/printing your files
    then they&#39;ll have to purchase an additional license.

  body: 'The answer is easy to find: <BR>Read the licenses for the fonts you&#39;re
    using. The terms vary from one foundry to another, but they&#39;re usually pretty
    explicit about what you can and can&#39;t do. <BR> <BR>As a general rule, I&#39;d
    say it&#39;s a safe bet that if someone is editing a doc, and needs to have the
    fonts loaded, they should own the fonts.'
