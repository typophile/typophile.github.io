  body: It&#39;s a very nice face and Adrian Frutiger once explained that is was the
    most difficult one to create. <BR>In the meantime he &#40;and Akira Kobayashi&#41;
    extended the Avenir with some more weights and a condensed version. That&#39;s
    the Avenir Next. Introduction around april this year. <BR>At the latest ATypI
    conference Akira presented some results. <BR>
