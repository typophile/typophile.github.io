  body: It's very similar to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stockbucket/b-52/">B-52</a>,
    or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/diamante/">Diamante Medium,</a>

    from Apostrophic Labs is fairly similar, but the M crotch isn't pointed and reaching
    the baseline.  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/solano-gothic/bold/|MVB
    Solano Gothic]] is also similar, but has the angles rounded out. The M, unfortunately,
    \ is more like Bombardier than your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
