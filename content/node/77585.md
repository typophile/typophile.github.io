body: "Hello everybody,\r\n\r\nWhile working on the numerals of Sensa I realised my
  weak spot (sketching) is really becoming a problem now. Untill now I have always
  just made a few poor sketches when an idea came to mind, and did the rest on the
  computer. So basically I'm trying to teach myself how to sketch, but it's not really
  working. Is it just a matter op practise or are there certain things I need to know.
  Any tips, links or anything else is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper

  body: "It partly depends what sort of information your sketch is for. If the sketches
    are just for you then try not to worry about what other people would think of
    them. Sometimes if a sketch isn't quite right a few annotations will fix it better
    than trying to redraw it. Obviously, looking other people's drawings can help
    you find a method that works for you. Have a look at Gerrit Noordzij\u2019s sketching
    technique, shown [[http://cdn.myfonts.net/s/ec/cc-200911/sketches.jpg|here]] as
    used by Hubert Jocham in these examples from his MyFonts Creative Characters interview
    from November 2009. [[http://new.myfonts.com/newsletters/cc/200911.html|(Full

    wonders for me. I have no idea how I ever worked without one.

  body: I use blank moleskine and draw the lines before I start sketching, but I often
    find myself making it too big or too small so that I don't end up between the
    lines.

  body: Try drawing your first letter without any guide lines, then rule your lines
    from that one for the others. Also, similar to what I said earlier, don't worry
    too much about your sketch not looking like a perfectly inked rendering. If your
    initial letters aren't quite to scale you can scan the drawing and manipulate
    them on screen; do slightly enlarged and reduced photocopies and collage those;
    do your second drawing on tracing paper over the first. Tracing paper is great
    for drawing letters because you can work on both sides.

  body: "When I was on my foundation course, the tutors said at the beginning that
    your sketchbook was for you only: it didn't matter how good it looked or anything.
    Then at the end of the course, we had to get our portfolios together for degree
    applications, and the tutors said my sketchbook looked rubbish, and needed to
    be smartened up. That was a bit mean of them, but I think the lesson learned is
    that anything you show to someone else should look great. Design of a sketchbook
    is just as sophisticated and \"manipulative\" as design of a logo.\r\nNowadays
    I have a moleskine notebook, where I put everything from shopping lists to font
    sketches, and I never show it to anyone; it's mine!"
