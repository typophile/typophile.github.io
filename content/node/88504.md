  editor: Tamye Riggs]\r\n\r\nThe Sweet collection is composed of typefaces based
  on the engraver\u2019s lettering styles that came into fashion at the beginning
  of the twentieth century. The collection is anchored by Sweet Sans, Mark van Bronkhorst\u2019s
  interpretation of the engraver\u2019s sans serif (kin to the drafting alphabets
  popularized in the early 1900s).\r\n\r\nA type designer based in the San Francisco
  Bay Area, Van Bronkhorst had long been a fan of these historic faces, many of which
  had all but disappeared from use. A few cuts of the engraver\u2019s sans style existed
  in digital form, including Sacker\u2019s Gothic (Monotype Imaging) and Engraver\u2019s
  Gothic (Bitstream), but these interpretations were somewhat limited in their scope.\r\n\r\nVan
  Bronkhorst sought to study the original forms in depth. As a graphic designer, he
  had worked with an engraving house in the past, and was aware that stationers and
  engravers used \u201Cmasterplates\u201D as lettering patterns, tracing letterforms
  with a pantograph device to manually transfer the forms to what would become the
  printing plate. He began hunting for masterplates, but found that most had been
  destroyed as engraving shops converted to digital typography. The majority of these
  shops had abandoned the tedious masterplate-tracing process in favor of more expedient
  photographic processes where \u201Cpretty much any digital font would do,\u201D
  Van Bronkhorst says. He decided it would be a good idea to preserve the masterplate
  lettering styles\u2014some good, some bad, some ugly\u2014as they seemed otherwise
  destined to disappear unless interpreted as digital fonts.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some
  digging, Van Bronkhorst discovered a stash of antique masterplates. With Linnea
  Lundquist, he commenced work on the first typeface in the Sweet range\u2014Sweet
  Upright Script\u2014likely the first digital version of this vintage social engraving
  design.\r\n\r\nVan Bronkhorst then turned his attention to the engraver\u2019s sans.
  Sweet Sans hearkens back to the same or similar masterplates as Sacker\u2019s Gothic.
  Upon close inspection, various masterplates of what would seem the same letterforms
  varied considerably. The process of interpreting the design was one of selecting
  various forms and characteristics while leaving others out. The engraver\u2019s
  sans was typically a cap-to-small-cap combination, yet a lowercase model did exist.
  Van Bronkhorst decided that Sweet\u2019s interpretation would be broad, including
  lowercase and small caps, and in weights from Hairline to Heavy, with true italics.
  The result is a nine-weight sans family that pays homage to the charm and dignity
  of its model.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NancySweetSans400_5633.gif]\r\n\r\nEncouraged
  by the positive response to the first releases, Van Bronkhorst is expanding the
  Sweet Sans family with a slightly modernized version, and plans to continue to gradually
  introduce more vintage stationer\u2019s lettering styles in digital form. His goal
  is to carefully build a collection that accurately represents the genre while offering
  type users a variety of styles to suit their needs.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet collection
