    pretty well, and has a OSX version. It has several good template options- over
    ten I think. Plus, you can make your own if you&#39;d like. Is ships with Suitcase
    10 or as shareware &#40;$10&#41;. This one might be what you need.

  body: Is it too late to restart this thread?  I just got a new Mac and am finally
    making the transition to OSX.  Among the Classic casualties is Font Gander, which
    I had had all set up with my own umpteen fonts per page templates/plug-ins.  Doesn&#39;t
    work running in Classic under  OSX 10.3.4.  &#40;OK, it prints and displays, but
    everything is jaggy, so it&#39;s useless.  I made a few attempts to activate the
    fonts I wanted to print in the Classic fonts folder, but to no avail&#41;.  I
    wasn&#39;t planning on keeping my old OS9 Mac around indefinitely; are there any
    OSX apps around that will do specimen pages with multiple fonts per page?  Thanks...
