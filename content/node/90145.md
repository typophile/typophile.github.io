  body: "Yes, this is confusing to us because the Latin writing system is the one
    used for English, French, German, Polish, etcetera. Rockwell is generally a Latin
    typeface in that sense.\r\n\r\nIf you mean \"special characters needed for scholarly
    Latin\" or something, for the Latin *language* per se, that is another matter.
    You'd need a font editing program to do it, and possibly the permission of the
    copyright holder on the font itself.\r\n\r\nThe short version is that modifying
    fonts is a bunch of work, and doing it properly without messing something up is
    not trivial in terms of expertise. If you're still at the point where you don't
    know about dedicated font editing software, you have a noticeable amount of learning
    that would be required, as in days not just hours. Weeks or more worth of learning
    if truly new characters are needed and not just minor modifications to existing
    ones.\r\n\r\nSo you might be best off getting a font that already has the support
    you need, unless you have a broader or more general interest in type design and
    font development.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: As the OP is Polish, I suspect that a lack of CE characters (e.g. with ogonek)
    is the issue.
