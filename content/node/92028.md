  a children's DVD design. I am really happy with that, I chose Chaparral Pro as the
  typeface and did not once have any second thoughts about my choice, it just felt
  right.  As it is a piece of coursework, I can choose my own typeface.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  my second piece of work is different.  It is a piece of poetry and I have looked
  at many different typefaces, including Arno, Goudy Oldstyle and Feijoa.  \r\n\r\nMy
  finished piece of work is set in Arno Pro.  This is great in that it has a great
  range of weights, swashes and so on, but I feel a real tug towards Feijoa.  I didn't
  realise one could get so involved in typefaces, to the extent where they are nagging
  at you at the back of your mind.\r\n\r\nI am really interested to know if others
  get this when choosing a typeface, and to know which typefaces \"call\" you the
  most\r\n\r\nThanks"

    is visualizing variations on that serif or spur that just ... isn't ... quite
    right....

    now in my head and the only thing to do now is bite the bullet and go ahead."
