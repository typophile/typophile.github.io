<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>OK here is again the same question you have seen here innumerable times...
Do you have any suggestions for body type?
Magazine is going to be a casual magazine for PC-oriented twenty-something game players with some technology and lifestyle articles thrown in. Not too hippy, thick or glamorous. Coated stock, 48 pages, published fortnightly.
There is high probability it is going to be a sans serif face.
Most sans serifs have though problems with legibility when used in long articles. They are too geometric: eye does not have enough "grabbing points". Also they are usually too thin, the color of text is too light.
I have used Formata a lot. It is very readable. I rather used something else in this project. Formata is... homely. Almost ugly. But it works well in small sizes.
I like Meta a lot, but it feels too artful for this.
Things to consider are also width of the font, font should be economical, fit a lot of text in small space.
Basically there is no need for other styles than regular (or book or medium, depending), italic, bold and bold italic. It would be nice if font's family system would not mess up InDesign's ability to keep italics and bolds in styles (as happens both Formata and Meta).
Other fonts will be selected to fit body font... but at the moment I have Helvetica Compressed in mind for headlines... it may well change.

<div class=commentbody>I just bought Josh Darden's entire Freight family this year. Love it. The sans is nice, but you also get the Micro version for small sizes. Don't know if the price is 'economical,' but I think the value on this family is extremely high --- and worth checking out! Sold through Garage Fonts:

This has to do with style-linking. Often, you can contact the foundry to modify the files if necessary.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I do not think DIN suitable for body text, at least in longer texts. Freight looks nice though price is high. It is though quite geometric and thus not very legible. Micro version is of course different.
At the moment I am trying Myriad Pro SemiCond, also Linotype's Finnegan looks right. Quest goes on...</div>
