  body: We don't have a great way of presenting it live and although we do plan to
    record it, we don't have permission from Ascender. (Yet.)

    a dream. Maybe something like that?

  body: Thanks to Steve and everyone at Ascender. It was great to hear your insights
    about type in the device space. It's pretty clear that reading on screens is only
    going to get bigger (if the amount of time I spend reading Typophile is any indication).
