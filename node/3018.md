  body: The question why a font? How many words are you using that require a reverse
    lower case y?

  body: Change the y in any font using font software &#40;like Fontographer&#41;,
    or replace it the way you did in the sample if you are only doing a few words.
    <BR> <BR>There are very few fonts with that kind of y, and you probably would
    not like them. Most look like the printing of children.
