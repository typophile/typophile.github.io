<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s clear that you&rsquo;re the one who has no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about. I&rsquo;ll blame your school for not teaching you this stuff, I guess. It&rsquo;s great that your friend LICENSED the fonts (he did not purchase them). You are indeed breaking the law in &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; the font software, just as you would be if your friend gave you the install disks for some other piece of software with a non-transferable, single-user license.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re so sure what you&rsquo;re doing is legal, go right ahead and call Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones for tech support. Be sure to explain your situation and see what they say.</p>

<p>Hmm. Your bio says your profession is &ldquo;art director.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, if you are a student, one lesson that must be learned is to work with materials available, even if &ldquo;availability&rdquo; is a matter of money. I assure you this won&rsquo;t be the only time this comes up.</p>

So, the font isn&rsquo;t actually your property to loan, share, trade, etc. Personally, I find some of the EULA&rsquo;s so restrictive ([[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/licensing/eula|House Indstries]] as an example) that I won&rsquo;t buy their fonts reguardless of the quality.</p>
<p>Ken W: You might consider contacting the foundry in question. Some folks have discounts for students - albeit sometimes limited to non-commercial applications. Then they might be able to solve your technical problem.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Khaled,</p>
<p>As a user of type, I&rsquo;m not entirely unsympathetic your position. The problem has more to do with what all this new technology has brought.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, you had bought Linotype mats for a linecaster. You&rsquo;d need 8 point, 9-point, and at least one of 10, 11, or 12-point. Plus some display sizes. Roman and italic (though most were duplexed). That&rsquo;s for &ldquo;one font,&rdquo; say Janson. The purchase price was about $2,000 in the early 1960s &ndash; about the price of a new car.</p>
<p>OK, you own them. But you own a shop with more than one casting machine. If you want run the magazines on more than one machine at a time, you&rsquo;d have to buy another set of mats &ndash; another new car.</p>
<p>Today, fonts are software, not physical objects. So, what is sold is a license, not a physical object. Copying is easy; policing copying is difficult. And the price doesn&rsquo;t let the font designer buy a car with each purchase &ndash; a good lunch is more like it.</p>
<p>The model of &ldquo;owning fonts&rdquo; is difficult with software, esp. to a collection of people use to viewing something as a physical object. But as has so often been pointed out to me, I&rsquo;m old. For the younger crowd, the notion of type as a physical object is passing strange. It will take a while for all this to settle down.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to skip purchasing a font, so off to lunch.</p>

<p>I seriously doubt, that the friend licensed the fonts in the first place. If they came from the original source, they wouln&rsquo;t have the problems described in the first post. These are typical problems of fonts that are extracted from PDFs or other documents. 
Also: If you copy digital goods, you don&rsquo;t LEND them. Lending means you give away something, you don&rsquo;t have then anymore. If you want to do that with fonts, no problem! You can transfer a license from one user to another. Just ask the font foundry.</p>

But producing physical copies did cost money and time for every single copy, which is not the case for digital type. You do the work once and want to keep profiting from it for a whole life! I work as a physician and I&rsquo;ve to work 6-12 hours a day to earn money, I don&rsquo;t write a prescription once and give soft copies of it to my other patients and expect to keep making money out of it, why type people think they are different?</div>

<p>If you steal a music CD from a store and are caught, you will be arrested. It is unlikely that you will be caught stealing software, but a crime occurs nonetheless. In the first instance, you did not steal the physical object&ndash;the disk&ndash;for the object itself, but for its content. The fact that, in the instance of software theft, there may be no physical product stolen does not mean that the two kinds of theft are intrinsically different. In either case, you intentionally deprive the creator of the work of any compensation for his or her efforts, which is theft, plain and simple.</p>
<p>As to your second point: if you buy a gun and possess, are you free to do whatever you want with it?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">And again, a typeface is clearly not interchangeable with a gun. Clearly Khaled can&rsquo;t go around doing what he wants with it, so that&rsquo;s moot. If you want to make a sensible comparison between a gun and a typeface you might note that the gun owner expects to be allowed to take the gun apart, look inside it or customize it for the job in hand, which most type EULAs prohibit. I think that is more akin to what Khaled is implying, so address his point sensibly.</div>

<p>I don&rsquo;t take your comments as a personal affront, so an apology is unnecessary. Yes, font retailers could place reckless surcharges on the products they peddle, just as people can choose to commit suicide. In either case, the results would be the same. If vendors maintain pricing levels which their customers find acceptable, they will continue to have paying customers. If vendors charge outrageous fees, they will discourage buyers and encourage pirates and thieves. It&rsquo;s that simple&hellip;</p>

In my area of type use (bookwork) you can easily get your work done with 4-5 families for the various texts, and perhaps the same again for display. Wanting more fonts is a matter of graphic designer boredom, not necessity. We all wind up paying for this boredom &ndash; in more ways than just money.</p>

<p>Yes, I do support ending drug patents too, because history tells us that drug manufacturers Mafia are happy with thousands (if not millions) of people dying as they can&rsquo;t offered their overpriced drugs. Patents are state granted monopolies and initially aimed for the good of people, if it is rather causing harm then it should die.</p>

<p>Charles that would be a fine solution if we Typophiles didn&rsquo;t moan so much about ubiquity…</p>
<p>Nick Shinn, I think the drug comparison is, again, way off the mark. My interpretation of what Khaled is saying is that he does 6 or 12 hours work and that is what he gets paid for, every time he works 6 or 12 hours. The fact he is a physician is not the point. He is talking about the value of labour - that he makes the prescription each time not once thereafter duplicating it.</p>
<p>Also Nick, I don&rsquo;t think it is useful to bring <em>profiteering from the availability of medicine</em> into the commercial type equation. It has far greater ethical ramifications than any debate about the luxury business of contemporary type design (oldnick already confessed it is not a compulsory purchase). In short the importance of available medicine trumps contemporary type design.</p>
<p>If you think that this <em>is</em> a safe comparison, then this industry clearly has no sense of itself, or it&rsquo;s place in the world, and as Khaled said earlier, has lost it&rsquo;s compass.</p>
<p>Shoot me.</p>

If you steal a music CD from a store and are caught, you will be arrested. It is unlikely that you will be caught stealing software, but a crime occurs nonetheless. In the first instance, you did not steal the physical object&ndash;the disk&ndash;for the object itself, but for its content. The fact that, in the instance of software theft, there may be no physical product stolen does not mean that the two kinds of theft are intrinsically different. In either case, you intentionally deprive the creator of the work of any compensation for his or her efforts, which is theft, plain and simple.</p>
<p>As to your second point: if you buy a gun and possess, are you free to do whatever you want with it?
</cite></p>
<p>First, I don&rsquo;t support violating license agreements (even if I find a certain license immoral), I rather avoid it completely. Second, stealing a physical object is not like copying a piece of software; when I steal an object I deprive it of you, a real loss. But when I copy a piece of software I deprive you nothing as you still have it, there is no real loss. There is however an expected loss, based on an unproven hypothesis that the &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; would have purchased a copy if he didn&rsquo;t get it for free, which I have never seen and evidence that support it (to the contrary, several studies fond that people who download music from file sharing services are the one who purchase music most!).</p>
<p>As for second point, I think it was clear that I was talking about ownership rights.</p>

<p><em>Doctors are often obliged to act outside of paid hours when the need arises, for example responding to an accident outside of work, without compensation.</em></p>
<p>Largely irrelevant. The basic fact remains that doctors perform a service for which they expect to be paid; doctors do not work &ldquo;on spec.&rdquo; Type designers develop products in hopes that they will be paid. For the most part, the work they do is entirely speculative. There is no hard guarantee that x amount of effort will yield y amount of income nor, for that matter, any income at all.</p>

So stop making bizarre comparisons to guns, CDs, pharmaceuticals. Type is type. It is consumed very specifically and it&rsquo;s distribution is changing. To preserve the profit margins of material type based on material manufacture and distribution whilst refusing to acknowledge duplicate sales is not a very strong position and it is something that people are skeptical of, hence this discussion.</p>
<p>As for following up the medical thread, I just wanted to point out that not everything is about money, and not everything should be a business, simply to answer Nick.</p>

<p>I have spent a little while trying to compose a response to your question but I honestly don&rsquo;t know. I hope you can forgive me for not having the answer of a chancellor.</p>
<p>I will say though that the value of a tool is often determined by how useful it is, not how many hours were spent inventing it, which seems to be the common justification of price argument here in the Typophile forum. As you said people can take it or leave it. It&rsquo;s probably better for everyone (designers/world in general) if they do take it, and that they are encouraged to do so legitimately. Customers know that the font license they buy is potentially one of thousands, maybe more, they are right to question the value of the product, and also the license. Many products are assessed also on availability. Usefulness and availability, that is how consumers are used to assessing worth. Probably if you are businesslike you have more exacting terms. So the consumer is right to have questions, it is only natural, and they deserve to have them answered respectfully, and without condescending analogies found here and regularly replayed across Typophile. Either way seems to be a pertinent issue.</p>

<p>You and I certainly can agree on the difficulty of the task, many jobs are difficult, most are underpaid. Do you want to be compensated though or to be paid? Sounds always as though type designers are at always at a loss, which is odd given that we have established some low cost aspects of the enterprise (it&rsquo;s not all lose lose). The word compensate has come up several times through the thread. Compensation implies loss, are you always at the mercy of these pirates? If so, it&rsquo;s quite a romantic vision of your own labour. Which business does not have some loss?</p>

<p>On another note: is there any comprehensive studies of who buys fonts, quantative and qualitive? My quess is advertising agencies, publishers, design firms and graphic designers in this order.</p>

<p>Besides which, companies are usually only harassed about their profits if they are actually making obscene profits in toto, not just marginal profits. Despite the cries of outrage expressed here over font pricing, prices of fonts have declined in the last 20 years*, and so have the number of people employed in said industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arguably with OpenType prices have gone back up slightly, but not at all in proportion to the increased work and value going into the fonts.</li>

<cite>Despite the cries of outrage expressed here over font pricing, prices of fonts have declined in the last 20 years*, and so have the number of people employed in said industry.</cite></p>
<p>My concern is not the prices of the font, but the freedoms its EULAs take from me, the rights of ownership that I should have on what I paid for. When I buy a car I get full ownership rights on it, I can sell it (most EULAs will say you can&rsquo;t), I can lend it to my friends, share it with them, take it apart, when it does not work as I want I can take to whatever mechanic I want. Most proprietary software vendors, including most type foundries take away my rights, my freedoms and if I want my freedoms back they call me a pirate and a thief. Also comparing digital copying to physical theft is moot, like comparing manufacturing physical goods to selling digital copies.</p>
<p>Because we are humans with morals and cultures, when I friend needs my help I ought to help him, but software vendors say no, by helping your friend you are a pirate, sorry software vendors but I&rsquo;ll follow my morals regardless of whatever you say.</p>

<cite>So, finally, we get back to the heart of the matter. Most EULAs begin &ldquo;By using or installing this font data, you (or you on behalf of your employer) agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement,&rdquo; or words to that effect. My initial response to Ken W was that he and his friend violated the terms of the Gotham EULA from the get-go./cite&gt;</p>
<p>Just because it is in the EULA doesn&rsquo;t make it moral or even legal, however I propose that every one who don&rsquo;t agree with an EULA to avoid the subjected font completely as a way to protest against it.</p>
<p><cite>Khaled seems resentful that he has to work for a living and, somehow or another—as he sees it—software developers of every stripe don&rsquo;t; this only goes to prove that he is abysmally ignorant of the amount of effort that goes into producing these &ldquo;intangible&rdquo; products.</cite></p>
<p>No, I made the comparison to point that in every other profession (not only medicine, but I picked that because it is mine), one have to do a work that adds a new value to get paid, but type designers seems to think that it is inherited right to keep profiting from work that they did only once years ago and still enforce illogical and immoral licensing rights on their customers, which is unique to software world.</p>
<p>And I know what does it take to to build type, I&rsquo;m actually working on a three font projects right now, one of which involves modernisation of one of Hermann Zapf old typefaces in collaboration with him.</p>
<p><cite>If a particular font meets your needs, you get what you pay for, regardless of what you pay for it&hellip;</cite>

<p>Nobody is taking your freedoms away. You are voluntarily entering into a license contract with the software (and font) vendors. If you don&rsquo;t want to enter that kind of license contract, choose open source software and fonts! If you can&rsquo;t find open source fonts that you like for your purposes, well, perhaps that points to the fact that retail font licensing with at least somewhat restrictive license terms has in the past been a lot more effective way of getting fonts created. I think open source fonts are gaining some ground, but the dominance of retail fonts in high-end design isn&rsquo;t ending any time soon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One more time an unbelievable boring discussion. My opinion: If you don’t have much money (and students have a tendency not to have much money) <em>and</em> if you don’t earn money with the work, for which you have used a font, <em>and</em> if you don’t brag about the work of others, you can use commercial fonts without doing anything that is immoral. The comparisons to material things are absurd. Just accept, what the internet is, because you cannot have freedom on the one and full control on the other side.</p>
<p>The only thing, that I have to criticize with regard to Ken, is, that he is claiming his friend has purchased the font. I doubt, that the Hoefler Type Foundry releases fonts in such a condition of the internal font names. So, either you don’t know, who your friends are, because they are lying, or you are lying or I am totally wrong and have to apologise. Well, there is another thing: Are you student (pupil) or art director, Ken?</p>
<p>Hehe, and not to forget: I don’t like vain young white and sporty guys with sun glasses and Macs. No, that’s a joke. Pure envy. Except from the Mac.</p>

<p>Again, comparison to a material thing does not really work as books do not have licenses that prohibit lending them? Which is I guess what Khaled initially took umbrage with (not the initial theft but the continued theft via lending) Even if he had legitimately purchased a font, he could not lend it, anymore than the person who stole it. Shock! I know you are all up in arms, how can you lend a digital file? Well of course you are right you can&rsquo;t, but that does go against a very natural human tendency. People are not used to paying for something they have little ownership of, that&rsquo;s all. Perhaps this is the trend of some digital technology, to become more closed. Look at the history of Apple computers, I think they originally came with circuit diagrams and now you can&rsquo;t even change your own battery in many products. Despite this I don&rsquo;t think Apple&rsquo;s position would be take it or leave it, which seems to be the common response to any probing here, in fact this is not the position of most industries, which eventually have to court the customer. Why not here with fonts? Khaled says that he is working on some fairly credible font projects yet he has received all the usual patronising reprise about how long fonts take to make etc. To me that is a shame.</p>
<p>But yes I take your point about monopoly and pricing, my mistake getting carried away probably. Though I got distracted by pricing I don&rsquo;t think I have said anything outrageous, certainly not a cry of outrage as you say.</p>
<p>However I was outraged by Nick Shinn&rsquo;s dubious red herring comparison to the availability of medicine, though that was an aside (persiflage) as we all know.</p>
<p><em>I think it&rsquo;s a fair comparison to make to a physician, who deals professionally with the politics of intellectual property with regards to the generic drug issue.</em></p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t think this is fair but never mind, it&rsquo;s not the debate in hand.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">To put things back in real font terms, I can foresee many situations whereby &lsquo;lending&rsquo; a legitimate font purchase would arise. For example, as a passing freelancer in a studio that owns a font. The studio may be small, three regular employers people, one or two occasional freelancers. Still within 5 machines stipulated by the licenses for the original purchase. If the font is deleted upon leaving, have all licenses been used up? The freelancer is not part of the business, therefore they are not on the agreement document for the font, but to criminalize everyone in the situation as pirates and thieves seems draconian. Of course the font probably won&rsquo;t be deleted, fair enough for your concern, but according to many here, by this point the EULA has already been compromised and everyone is now on CIA hit list ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ray:</p>
<p><cite>I&rsquo;m curious as to why those font names are screwed up. It reminds me of something TransType Pro would do when converting from TTF to OTF with the default settings.</cite></p>
<p>Counting the &ldquo;regulars&rdquo; and &ldquo;italics&rdquo;, it adds up to the standard list of Gothams from H&amp;FJ: Thin, Extra Light, Light, Book, Medium, Bold, Black and Ultra. Probably Book or Medium account for &ldquo;Bold&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bold Italic&rdquo;, the rest appear all once as Regular and once as Italic.
The exact style name seems to be omitted &ndash; that&rsquo;s the OP&rsquo;s <em>real</em> problem &ndash;, and your suggestion of a dumb conversion might be right.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, &ldquo;only&rdquo; converting the font from one type to another is <em>also</em> forbidden by most EULAs. Some allow it <em>for personal use</em>, and that&rsquo;s clearly not the case here :-) (Is one allowed with the Larabie fonts?)</p>

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>The discussion is still stuck around the difference of licensing vs. buying. An EULA doesn&rsquo;t take away any rights. With a user license agreement a vendor and a user AGREE on a price under certain conditions (as stated in the EULA). What some people here seem to forget: The regular price of fonts is directly based on these conditions! If you want to spread the font in your company: fine! We will set up a multi-user license. If you want to put the font on a server: fine! We set up a server license. If you want a I-can-do-whatever-I-want-license: Okay! But then we will probably end up with a price like those 1500 bucks for a photo lettering disc of one one font style, that you actually owned in the 1970s. 
But if you want my font for 30 bucks, you need to agree to the terms of my standard license. If you can&rsquo;t do that, you can&rsquo;t use my fonts. If you break the conditions of my EULA you break a legal contract. If you use my font without a license, that&rsquo;s illegal. This is the law in almost all countries of the world. Nothing to argue with that. 
I agree that the word &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; might not be appropriate in this context, but EULAs are still legal contracts and the users are bound to it, whether you like it or not. There is no general &ldquo;right&rdquo; to do whatever you want with my creative work.</p>
<p>Concerning &ldquo;loss&rdquo;:
Yes there are font collectors out there, which would never buy a font anyway. So there is no real financial loss for the software vendor. And there are design studios who purchase a license for every font they use. But in reality: Many users fall inbetween. They look if they can find a font they want on their hard drive or the internet, and only buy it, if they can&rsquo;t find it there. (It&rsquo;s natural—they want to increase their profit.) And so, there is a very real financial loss here for the foundries. Even if their is nothing &ldquo;physically stolen&rdquo;.  That&rsquo;s why some foundries don&rsquo;t even put specimen PDFs of their fonts on the web or limit the character set. Because they know, the minute they do it, they will decrease their sales of this font. So please don&rsquo;t try to give the impression that illegal font copies do no harm, because nothing is &ldquo;stolen&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Concerning &ldquo;poor&rdquo; students:
It&rsquo;s funny that every design student I know has a shining new MacBook Pro for 2000 bucks, but no 30 for a font license. Oh yes, the fonts are only for &ldquo;academic purpose&rdquo;. So illegal copies are okay then. They are not. Design students should respect the value of creative work as soon as possible in their career. What if one student copies the design of another student? The latter would be furious. What if the first student said it was only for &ldquo;academic purpose&rdquo;? Would it help? Probably not. So this argument is nonsense. 
But I would say that vendors can still do more for academic users. There are foundries with academic discounts, but this is often well hidden somewhere on the website. We clearly offer student discounts of around 30% and a lot of students buy them. It&rsquo;s a full license that is still valid even if you are no student anymore. So you really get a benefit here. And the fonts do work, not like those ripped Gotham-Fonts of Ken W.</p>

<p>Students seem to get very easily stereotyped on this website.

<p>Probably a Bitstream collection and those dopey names are absolutely legal on account of the US copyright laws, which cover trademarks/names/brands, but not the appearance of typefaces… BT-fonts used to be of very high quality.

<p>Thanks Ralf, can&rsquo;t ever imagine it happening that way though… I understand all points made in this thread but EULAs don&rsquo;t seem to correspond to the nature of the coal face. It seems strange making end user agreements whilst ignoring what many end users want and in fact do. Perhaps EULAs could be more sensitive to this particular situation (I guess wording would have to remain as is, perhaps just see in different light), as not to criminalize those who had paid, essentially to reward them with better rights than those who don&rsquo;t pay at all? I think that is the point that ignited the thread. I guess people will just say, if you want more rights, pay more for them and stick by their guns, well I can&rsquo;t argue with that.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

There is no particular situation. This is what freelancing is about. You pay your own bills and have your own income. You need to charge your clients in a way so you cover your expenses and still make your living. Why should you be eligible for THEIR software licenses if you work as an independent designer/businessman?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I think there <em>is</em> one issue regarding students, worth considering:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Many colleges or universities that teach design require students to produce interesting/compelling/fresh/whatever projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are in competition with each other, and the grading is typically defined by the average/overall level of the projects in the class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one student uses a &ldquo;fresh cool&rdquo; pirated font, and the other uses a licensed font, but one that he already has because it&rsquo;s, say, a part of a standard font library, bundled with some applications &ndash; then unfortunately, in many cases, the <em>first</em> student gets a better grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many design colleges and universities do not require licensing proof from students that the assets (fonts, images etc.) they used are legally acquired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many design colleges and universities do not educate their students about licensing issues, and are rather mean with money when it comes to licensing assets (say, fonts) for use in class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The students behave primarily by the rules set by the SCHOOL. If the school condones piracy, students will pirate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the school&rsquo;s obligation to educate and enforce ethical behavior in design among students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should primarily report our objections to the schools and teachers, not to the students. The student will do <em>anything</em> that is permitted or condoned by the school to get the credit &ndash; especially if his fellow students do so. It must be the school that defines the boundaries.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A.</p>

<p>I know, it&rsquo;s all good on paper but that is not how it goes down. If I tried to charge a studio for a font on a one day job, that they had already paid for I&rsquo;d be laughed out the door and you know it! What about a half day job? I might as well just work for free too! After all that&rsquo;s what your beef is about way up the food chain. Therefore there <em>is</em> such a situation.</p>
<p>What about two freelancers collaborating on a project and buying a font between them? Do they have to set up a company just for that one project, then dissolve it afterwards and then who gets the rights to the font afterwards?! I am pointing out that the EULA can discriminate against well meaning people in this situation.</p>

<p>Do you think that it is horrible that if you buy a copy of MS Windows or Adobe Photoshop that you are not legally permitted to give it away to a thousand people—and they to another thousand?</p>
<p>The whole software industry rests on this licensing model, so if you object to it, I think you should explain how software creators can be paid for their work under another model.</p>
<p>If you object only to fonts being licensed rather than sold, and not to other software being licensed, then why?</p>

<p>If you are limited to the fonts, that you have licensed, this does not necessarily limit your creativity, but it can limit the quality of the result of your work. And the aim should not only be doing your best in the limits of what you have licensed. Learning GIMP on the Volkshochschule is not the same as learning Photoshop wherever. A university, which would control, that all fonts and each software, that students use, are licensed, would be a joke. Even if it is a university specialized on theology. You expect three times more morality than it is taught at the medical faculty of almost all universities.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>By the way, if Ken would be the kind of person, that is searching for pirated fonts, he probably already would have discovered, that Gotham belongs to the most pirated fonts. And a simple Google search would have shown him, that there are a dozens of unprotected directories, in which Gotham is stored in authentic condition. Gotham is so easily to get, that a request on a warez forum probably would be a joke.</p>
<p>Some of you seem to believe, they could protect their fonts by not providing specimens in PDF format. It is just the other way around. If you provide specimens, three from four pirates share the PDF extract. If you don’t provide them, it needs a bit longer until one of your fonts is pirated, but then four of four pirates share the original, except you still provide your fonts in Type 1 only, because then you can be sure, that someone damages the fonts in a conversion process and your fonts float around in a damaged condition, which can harm your reputation likewise, if potential customers think, that the damaged fonts are the real deal.</p>
<p>Some of your EULA are simply counterproductive. If the only way not to violate EULA is to pirate the font (because you can violate only contracts, in which you have agreed), then you should not wonder, if potential customers don’t license your fonts.</p>
<p>And if those discussions always start just because such a young sun glassed guy is asking a simple question, you make yourself 	unsympathetic. And being sympathetic is also important in that business.</p>

<cite>If you buy a book, you don&rsquo;t have the right to scan it and distribute PDFs of it to your friends. Or even to photocopy the entire thing and send hard copies to your friends.</cite></p>
<p>For around 7000 years of human civilization, this was not the case. As one with Islamic background, I know for sure that you were allowed to copy, distribute, cite, write commentaries on books without asking original author for permissions. There are even cases of authors dying before finishing their books and some one else picking it, completing the work and releasing it with both names on it. Actually, the model for publishing books never involved paying the original author, unless they were the ones making and selling the copies, even in this case any one can make and sell other copies. And this was the case even with the introduction of printing, and it only changed in the last century or so.</p>
<p>This is how human civilization was built, Newton one said: <cite>If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants</cite>.</p>

<p>All the three projects are free software, two are already under Open Font License (I&rsquo;m not the only contributor), namely a renewal of Zapf and Kunth&rsquo;s Euler mathematical font (With OpenType MATH etc.), and an OpenType enriched version of STIX fonts (my work in not affiliated with STIX project, though), the other font is a revival of a famous Arabic typeface and I&rsquo;m yet to decide about the license, but most probably it&rsquo;ll be dual licensed under OFL and GPLv3.</p>

<cite>Khaled, what you don&rsquo;t address is that all software products are legally in the same situation as fonts: they are generally licensed rather than sold, and can be easily shared.</p>
<p>Do you think that it is horrible that if you buy a copy of MS Windows or Adobe Photoshop that you are not legally permitted to give it away to a thousand people—and they to another thousand?</p>
<p>The whole software industry rests on this licensing model, so if you object to it, I think you should explain how software creators can be paid for their work under another model.</p>
<p>If you object only to fonts being licensed rather than sold, and not to other software being licensed, then why?</cite></p>
<p>I never said my concerns are only about type and fonts, but the whole proprietary software industry. And yes, to me the whole business model is flowed and immoral. There is a vibrant business around free software and it is profiting, and companies like Redhat are profiting even in depression years. Free software companies might not be multi billion dollar gorillas, but I think it is all agreed that giant corporations with near complete monopolies aren&rsquo;t for the best of our interest.</p>
<p>PS. this very forum is running a free CMS on top of a free web server on top of a free OS.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Khaled,</p>
<p>two aspects are in some opposition: the freedom and rights of creation against the freedom and rights of use/consumption. Another way to look at it is an opposition of the values of an individual vs. the values of the public.</p>
<p>The freedom and the rights of creation indicate that I should be free to create anything and to control what others can do with my creation. Philosophically, it&rsquo;s an extension of my personal rights and freedom. If I should be free to and have the rights to decide what may and ma not happen with my body or my property, by extension this should apply also to things I create. This value protects the individual. It defines the liberties of the individual and the duties of the public (to respect those liberties).</p>
<p>The freedom and the rights of use/consumption are values that protect the public. The basis of this paradigm is that no individual can acquire property or produce creation in complete isolation, so the individual carries some debt towards the public (past, present and future generations). Therefore, the public should have some way to &ldquo;cash in&rdquo; on an individual&rsquo;s creations, since those were likely to have been facilitated by the public somehow. This defines the liberties of the public and the duties of the individual.</p>
<p>The entire human life is based on the constant struggle to find an optimal balance between those two values. Different political and economic systems propose to shift the balance more to the left or more to the right. Liberals give more priority to the values of the individual, socialists give more priority to the values of the public. There are extremists on both sides, and there are lots of people who are somewhere in the middle, trying to find a compromise.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re free to have a concern about one model or another, but you should be aware that this is simply your <em>opinion</em>, as valid as any. Depending on the political and economic balance of the world, your country or your community, you may have more or less chances to have things done &ldquo;your way&rdquo; vs. you needing to adopt to things being done &ldquo;their way&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Surely there are opensource models that are profitable, and this is why I will always advocate the RIGHT for people to set up businesses that operate under an opensource model. But no OBLIGATION. I.e. I believe everyone should have a choice to manufacture, create, use, modify etc. opensource products, or to produce and use closed-soource products.</p>
<p>And this is, in fact, reality: you and I have a choice whether we use Windows, Mac OS X or Linux, whether we use Internet Explorer or Firefox or Safari, whether we use FontForge or FontLab Studio, whether we use Gotham or Gentium. And we have a choice what we want to do with the fruits of our work. You&rsquo;re free to publish your fonts under an opensource license, and Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones are free to publish their fonts under a license of their liking.</p>
<p>Three things I&rsquo;d like to ask you though are:</p>
<ol>
<li>How come there are so little typographically valuable typefaces published under opensource licenses? Most opensource fonts are mediocre, or they are knock-offs, or they are drawn by people who obviously cannot draw type.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is Nimbus Roman, Tempora LGC, TeX Gyre Termes, GNU FreeFont Serif, Doulos SIL and probably a number of other opensource knockoffs of Times. There is Nimbus Sans, TeX Gyre Heros, GNU FreeFont Sans and probably some more opensource knockoffs of Helvetica. There are at least three opensource knockoffs of Palatino (Palladio, TeX Gyre Pagella, FPL Neu). But why are there so few good original designs?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>You do realize that Hermann Zapf could afford to make Euler mostly because he had very successful deals with <em>commercial</em> font foundries (D. Stempel and later Linotype, Bitstream, URW) which paid his bills, so he could <em>spend</em> some money (essentially) to design some type that would be published under a liberal license. You know that, right?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you explain the fact that opensource versions of the same designs are far less frequently used than commercial versions? Pagella or FPL Neu are less used than Palatino or Zapf Calligraphic, Doulos, Tempora or Termes are less used than Times, and Charis is less used than ITC Charter. So it seems that people tend to pay for closed-source fonts even if free opensource versions with the same design exist. Why?</p>
</li>
</ol>

Adam</p>

If instead of it only taking a few seconds of your time to copy a font and give to a friend, it would take a years worth of all your time each time you did it? Would you still give it away for free to 1,000 friends? or would you become far more judicious in your donation of your life to them?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>BTW, in some countries such as Germany, restrictions in mass contracts such as &ldquo;non-transferable licenses&rdquo; are invalid (they can only exist in individually negotiated contracts). In Germany, the value of business is protected by the law.</p>
<p>That is, if my company spends $200,000 for software licenses, and the licenses are non-transferable, it means that I cannot sell it, which means that it has no monetary value. So I cannot include those font licenses in my company&rsquo;s assets. In other words, my company just burned $200,000. A high German court ruled that such restrictions are invalid.* If I purchase software (or font) licenses, I can always sell them. This means that they actually have a value for me. This gives me confidence that I don&rsquo;t risk my entire money, that I can get some of my investment back if it does not work out for me.</p>
<p>I would like to encourage font vendors to DROP the &ldquo;non-transferable&rdquo; clause from their EULAs. I don&rsquo;t see the vast advantages that they would gain for keeping it, but it undermines their credibility, creates distrust in the customers, and actually raises the possibility of piracy. I think it is a fair and justifiable question from a client: &ldquo;Why should I pay so much money for a font license if it has no monetary value because I cannot sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would, however, be very interested in hearing from foundries who have included a &ldquo;non-transferable&rdquo; clause in their EULA why they have done so, what rationale is behind it, and how they explain it to their users.</p>
<p>A comparison: if I buy a book, I cannot redistribute the copies I make, but I can sell that very book.</p>
<p>A market of discounted second-hand font licenses would have its value. If students or smaller studios can buy second-hand font licenses cheaper, it&rsquo;s more likely that they will actually buy one rather than pirating it. The &ldquo;non-transferable&rdquo; clause really sends the wrong message. (In fact, in Germany, such market does exist and is doing well.)</p>
<p>Of course, font vendors are free to put any clauses in their EULAs they want, and in many countries, their entire EULA will be effective. In some countries, parts of their EULA will not be valid. The &ldquo;non-transferable&rdquo; clause is legal in the U.S. but has no effect in Germany. Why would font vendors want to &ldquo;punish&rdquo; their U.S. customers and sell them fonts under worse conditions than to those that their German clients get?</p>
<p>Best,
Adam</p>
<ul>
<li>Specifically, on one occasion, the German courts ruled that a clause in the EULA for System Builder versions of Microsoft Windows, which prohibited distributors from selling those versions of Microsoft Windows without accompanying hardware, was invalid. The System Builder or OEM versions of Microsoft software was much cheaper than the &ldquo;normal retail&rdquo; versions, came without a fancy box with just a serial number, and Microsoft&rsquo;s intention was that they should be only sold with new computers. But many distributors were selling them to customers without new computers, i.e. &ldquo;unbundled&rdquo;. The court said that Microsoft was not allowed to prevent distributors from &ldquo;unbundling&rdquo; those versions of their software, and that such a method of price discrimination was illegal. Therefore, in Germany, those versions are being sold legally at a fraction of the price of the fancy boxed editions (which are also being sold, and are doing very well).</li>
</ul>
<p>On another occasion, the German courts ruled that a clause that prohibited reselling of a retail software product was invalid, because such clause was &ldquo;against public policy&rdquo; (&ldquo;sittenwidrig&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In both those cases, the German courts clearly favored the public value over the individual&rsquo;s value (the individual in those cases would be the software publisher).</p>
<p>Those kinds of decisions are being made all the time. It is completely natural for the individual to try to maximize his own rights and liberties, and it is the task for the political and judiciary system to restrict and control those, and weigh the individual&rsquo;s values against the values of the public. It&rsquo;s a constant battle, and in fact, it is the very core of politics (at least, it should be), and the core reason why public institutions and governments exist (or, should be).</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the university needs to CONTROL it. But it should require the students to sign a declaration that they have used legal assets.</p>
<p>At my university (in Germany, business administration and later cultural anthropology), people who wrote essays or diploma theses were required to include a declaration that they have produced the text themselves, and that they did not quote any unreferenced sources. This requirement was introduced half-way through my course and I remember that my fellow students were then more aware of the moral and possible legal implications of IP theft.</p>
<p>I think when teaching design, teaching design ethics should actually be an essential, core element of any curriculum. This is EXACTLY what a university is for.</p>

<p><cite>I think when teaching design, teaching design ethics should actually be an essential, core element of any curriculum. This is EXACTLY what a university is for.</cite></p>
<p>Totally unimportant in case of artistic creative professions. Have a look at the latest discussion about Tannenberg on the Type ID Board. Even if the NAZIS had set the tattooed number of the people, that they have murdered, in Tannenberg, it would not say anything about the quality and artificial worth of the font. There are two and only 
two thing, that are immorally in art: If the artist misuses people or animals. (There is an <strong><a href="http://blogphotos.cybertranslator.idv.tw/kaleidoscope/2008/09/tattooed-pigs.jpg">artist, Wim Delvoye</a></strong>, who tattoos Disney images [I once saw a documentation about him on TV.] on the skin of living pigs. I like that project, but I must admit, it is immorally.) The second and almost more important thing is, not to boast about the creative work of anybody else. So pirating a font or any other piece of art or design and changing the copyright info to his own name, that is the most immoral thing one can do.</p>
<p>A person, that needs to be taught, that he should not boast about the creative work of others, will never create fine art, because he is a mental alga and the best profession for him would be photosynthesis.</p>
<p>But EULA freaks can trust in the incompetence of politicians:

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Khaled, you have the merit of consistency.</p>
<p>The problem with having no legal protection for software becomes particularly clear when we consider music and movies. There the usual up-front costs of production are from a hundred thousand, for a music album, to tens or even hundreds of millions for a commercial movie. Without the money from sales of digital copies of these most probably would never get made at all. Also, as others have pointed out before, a lot of production of the freely sharable software is subsidized by salaries from universities and private industry. These subsidized activities are really special cases, and cannot, IMHO, be taken as a general model for everything digital.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like Adam&rsquo;s analysis. In many ways, it parallels the difference between &ldquo;freedom from&rdquo; and &ldquo;freedom to&rdquo; that confuses so many in the States when the topic of &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; come up.</p>
<p>And I suppose eventually the marketplace may sort things out. For example, in the States, there are several university presses that have adopted a policy that only Adobe fonts can be used. The usual reason given is the generous Adobe EULA, and ease of further licensing for other, non-print purposes.</p>
<p>But the marketplace is slow, and it could be easy to get seriously disadvantaged during this sorting process. For example, there are a number of university pressses that require the typesetter to supply them, in addition to the PDF used for printing the book, with both the applications files and the fonts used. The later breaks the typesetter&rsquo;s EULA. One of our occasional customers is such a press, and I have resisted, agreeing to send the application files, but not the fonts. This may cost us a customer.</p>
<p>I am told that another large university press &ndash; for whom we do no work, so this is second-hand information &ndash; has licenses for all the Adobe fonts and all Monotype fonts. They require all designs to use only these fonts. Additionally, typesetter is required to include the fonts used as a part of the data sent the publisher at the end of the job. Again, technically, even though the press has licensed copies of the fonts, this breaks the typesetters EULA (number of copies of fonts allowed).</p>
<p>In addition to that technical violation, there is another issue. I do work on most of our typefaces. For example, our Minion has a number of characters not included in the Foundry fonts. There are also extra features and kerning beyond what is in the foundry fonts. My belief, perhaps in error, is that one of the reason publishers use us is the extra work that has gone into many of our fonts. If I then give the publisher the fonts, they could send them to another, less expensive composition shop, and a competitive edge we worked quite hard for will be lost.</p>
<p>I suppose we might have some legal recourse, but we are small, and have neither the time nor resources for lawsuits. And we still would have broken the EULA, so who knows what the courts would decide.</p>
<p>The purpose of the EULA should be to protect the designer and/or publisher of the fonts. The two things I see that need protection are financial compensation, and reputation. As is so often the case, the legal language used to try and achieve this creates additional problems. Secondly, the information needed by a publisher (how much will it cost) is not readily available from many foundries. Thirdly, what is technically feasible with multiple uses of data (say, a book in electronic format) keeps outstripping the language of the license.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see obvious solutions. But what font designers have to understand is (1) there are legitimate concerns beyond their own, and (2) an insistence on stringent protection can result in the marketplace refusing to use their products.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve no problem with people expressing their own rights on their own &ldquo;creations&rdquo;, but when they want to exchange those &ldquo;creations&rdquo; with my money, their rights stop and my rights begin. They are not doing me a favour, they are selling me a product and I, as a customer, have the very right to be concerned about my freedom.</p>
<p>I also have no problem with people doing non-free software (and type), though I&rsquo;ve my own ethical concerns, but it is still there very right to do so, and when it comes to work of artistic value, I can tolerate a bit of extra restrictions. What I&rsquo;m really concerned about is the draconian rules most EULA&rsquo;s have, you talked about non-transferable licenses but there are also other unbelievable restrictions like number of computers or processors, or number of page views (my first reaction reading things like that was WTF), or no modification even for personal use (WTF, even a &ldquo;viral&rdquo; license like GPL which requires all modification to be released under GPL, says if you don&rsquo;t distribute the modified versions you are not required to release your modifications), or other similar draconian rules.</p>
<p><cite>There is Nimbus Roman, Tempora LGC, TeX Gyre Termes, GNU FreeFont Serif, Doulos SIL and probably a number of other opensource knockoffs of Times. There is Nimbus Sans, TeX Gyre Heros, GNU FreeFont Sans and probably some more opensource knockoffs of Helvetica. There are at least three opensource knockoffs of Palatino (Palladio, TeX Gyre Pagella, FPL Neu). But why are there so few good original designs?</cite></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d not used the word &ldquo;knockoff&rdquo;, all aforementioned fonts are legitimately released under free licenses by their copyright holders (Pagella for example based on Palatino version Zapf did for URW who later released it under GPL etc.)</p>
<p>Back to the main question, apparently artists, unlike software developers, are not so interested in the idea of sharing and free software; you can see many talented programmers contributing to free software (and many end up being paid for doing that), but you can hardly find any artists, yet the very talented ones. Why is that, I don&rsquo;t know and I sincerely wish to know.</p>
<p><cite>2. You do realize that Hermann Zapf could afford to make Euler mostly because he had very successful deals with <em>commercial</em> font foundries (D. Stempel and later Linotype, Bitstream, URW) which paid his bills, so he could <em>spend</em> some money (essentially) to design some type that would be published under a liberal license. You know that, right?</cite></p>
<p>AFAIK, Hermann Zapf were commissioned by AMS to design Euler (Knuth and his students did the digitization) and AMS released it under free license (last year they re-licensed all their fonts, including Euler under OFL.)</p>

<p>That is all based on the assumption that giving free copies or allowing people to share their copies will hinder sales, but no one took the very basic effort to prove that.</p>
<p>To the contrary, there are well known occasions of free sharing increasing sales. For example the Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho is known for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Coelho#File_Sharing">&ldquo;pirating&rdquo; his own books and spreading it through per-to-pear networks</a> which increased not decreased book sales.</p>
<p>There is also that Norwegian study finding that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/apr/21/study-finds-pirates-buy-more-music"><cite>those who downloaded &ldquo;free&rdquo; music – whether from lawful or seedy sources – were also 10 times more likely to pay for music.</cite></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not familiar with this case, but it seems that an important point here is that it was the author&rsquo;s own choice to take this particular action.

<p>That&rsquo;s just plain wrong. If you purchase a font license you enter a legal contract. The vendor offers a product under certain conditions and the moment you purchase the license you agree to these conditions and you enter the contract. It&rsquo;s not any different from signing a contract for renting an apartment, where you are bound to certain rules and will be legally held responsible if you break them. 
You have no &ldquo;right&rdquo; to exceed the number of CPUs/page views or whatever. You have voluntarily agreed to these restrictions. And as I have explained before: These are not &ldquo;draconian rules&rdquo;: The price of the fonts is directly based on these restrictions (– calculated in a way to make a living for the designer and foundry from the expected sales). If you want a font license with no limitations, you can have that – but for a very different price.</p>

<p>Oh man, 99.9% percent of all pirates neither change the name of the font nor the name of the designer stored in the copyright info. It can be a theft of intellectual property only, if another person claims, that he is the designer.</p>
<p>@ Ralf Hermann</p>
<p>As I already said,you cannot break contracts, in which you have not agreed. And if your EULA has absurd limitations, you should not wonder, if potential customers don’t agree, because they have to fear, that they loose their license. So at least you should guarantee, that those ones, that violate your EULA in your opinion, get their money back, if they loose their license. Do you guarantee that? I assume, you don’t. As long as the pirates don’t steal all of the backups of your fonts, they cannot steal your fonts.</p>

<p>There is every strong evidence that [[http://asne.org/article_view/articleid/12/u-s-newsroom-employment-declines-12.aspx|employment of journalists has declined]], because of decline in newspaper sales, on account of free internet news. This is the subject of very widespread discussion and concern in the US.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You are missing the fact that people are moved to buy because they want to be legal. Under your rules, it would not be illegal to share all music, videos, software applications, or fonts. All digital files would be &ldquo;shareware,&rdquo; in the sense of free, fully functional files for which producers could only ask for contributions. While there is a still some niche market for such software, the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware|Wikipedia article on Shareware]] makes clear that the once widespread practice of shareware in Games, for example, contracted to a small part of the market because by paying programmers and writers, commercial firms were able to produce superior games.</p>
<p>I think that recent history shows that under the free shareware + contribution model, the great majority of the fantastic software we have available would not exist.</p>
<p>Further, it seems your position is against any kind of intellectual property rights. This would go back to the time when publishers could print a new edition of a book by an author without paying the author.</p>
<p>Whether something is just or not depends on whether there is another way to organize society that will get the same benefits in a way that is fairer. It seems to me that your proposal&ndash;all shareware&ndash;is proven not viable as getting the same benefits, both in fonts and in other digital products such as games, music, and movies. Therefore, I think you cannot legitimately argue that anything but free shareware is unethical.</p>
<p>If producers don&rsquo;t get paid, you will get fewer quality products. Therefore, if you want a realistic alternative, it has to include a realistic way for producers to get an income.</p>

<p>Sure. But I was referring to customers who bought the font license, but think they are not bound to the EULA. If you are talking about pirated commercial fonts, then obtaining the fonts is already illegal. Breaking the EULA or downloaded fonts illegally – it doesn&rsquo;t make a difference.<br>
(I already agreed that &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; is not the right word in this context.)</p>
<p>BTW: Our EULA allows to modify the fonts and you are free to sell the fonts again, if you agree to let us know, so we can file the change of the licensee in our database. Not so draconian after all, is it?</p>

Then every user could just use the font (to set a brochure/logo or whatever), break the license voluntarily and ask for the money back. Software is a non-returnable good once it was used or unsealed – according to the law – for example here in Germany.</p>

<p>Yes, sure it is a serious question. Who is in the burden of proof, if you claim, that your EULA was violated?</p>
<p>I just saw, that your EULA does not include the permission to create a PDF for commercial purposes. You have to get an extra license, if you want to do that. So, if I have a comercial website, on which I publish a PDF, for which I have used one of your fonts, you could say, that this already is a violation of your EULA, because it may be, that I earn more money with my website, because I have published the nice PDF with your font there, although the PDF can be downloaded for free.</p>

<p>Yes, you are right. The paragraph above the one, to which I was regarding, excludes another interpretation. But what is with websites, on which the membership costs anything? If I publish PDF with hardcore and Graublau on my xxx website? Is the PDF free of charge then or do my customers pay partly for the PDF, although I only take money for the membership from them? I mean, you don’t belong to the bad guys, but my question is not wayward.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking and advocating free software; a software model in which you can 
make money in many different ways other than over charging your users or

</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by &ldquo;over charging&rdquo;? There are tens of thousands of fonts on the market. If people decide to buy certain fonts, they agree to the price. If the price is too high for them, they just buy a cheaper font. And they do with a &ldquo;free&rdquo; font.</p>
<p>Draconian licensing rules are not exclusive to closed-source software. GPL licensing rules are draconian. And there are many licenses, both opensource and closed-source, that cannot be called &ldquo;draconian&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You seem to be viewing everything that is not &ldquo;white&rdquo; by your own rules as &ldquo;black&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a naive view, in my opinion.</p>
<p>One can dispute certain aspects of any model — such as I have done above in the case of the &ldquo;non-transferable&rdquo; rule in some font EULAs, or as I frequently do in case of GPL or the abuse (privatization) of the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; by some opensource advocates — but I think completely dismissing one model and blindly advocating another is somewhat immature, I think.</p>
<p>The world would not be a better place if all software were opensource overnight. It&rsquo;s more refined than that.</p>

<p>AFAIK, Hermann Zapf were commissioned by AMS to design Euler 
(Knuth and his students did the digitization) and AMS released 
it under free license (last year they re-licensed all their 
fonts, including Euler under OFL.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re saying is that the opensourcing process of Euler was paid by students of Stanford University, whose tuition money was used to pay for Knuth&rsquo;s and his students' time, or by the members of the American Mathematical Society, whose annual membership fees were used to pay for Zapf&rsquo;s, Knuth&rsquo;s and the students' time?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s a model just as OK as anything else. I don&rsquo;t see how it would be any better or worse from me paying directly the price for the fonts I use. Some people can advocate that it&rsquo;s better, others can advocate that it&rsquo;s worse. If I&rsquo;m a student at Stanford University, I pay my tuition but I have no control how this money is spent. This also happens with taxes. I need to trust the institution that distributes the money (the university, the state) to use my money wisely and somehow use my or someone else&rsquo;s money to produce goods or deliver services that somehow will also be beneficial to myself. Otherwise, there&rsquo;s no sense in paying tuitions or taxes.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like opensource fonts or software &ldquo;magically get paid for themselves&rdquo;, or that the opensource models use some &ldquo;other ways&rdquo; to make money that are inherently better than straight licensing fees. Lots of opensource projects are financed by educational and research institutions that get the money from, among others, me. So <em>I pay</em>. Sometimes for stuff that is useful to me, sometimes for stuff that is useless to me.</p>
<p>But I pay because I subscribe to the system of tax-funded investments since some projects are better done that way. But I also subscribe to the system or private payments because other projects are better realized that way. Looking for an optimal mixture is the big goal.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;re advocating, i.e. opensourcing everything, means that everything will be state-funded from my taxes. Everything is &ldquo;common goods&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a nice system.</p>
<p>Wait&hellip; I actually grew up and lived in such system. The country was called People&rsquo;s Republic of Poland, it existed from 1945 to 1989. The system was called &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; or &ldquo;real socialism&rdquo; by its proponents (who liked very much to talk about &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; in the sense that they defined for their own purpose), and &ldquo;communism&rdquo; by everyone else.</p>
<p>There is general consensus among the people who actually lived in that system that they&rsquo;re better up when the system is now gone. I agree with them. But good luck in your effort to set up Communism 2.0. Perhaps it&rsquo;ll be better than Communism 1.0.</p>
<p>But please, count me out from your experiments. I prefer to live the way I live now. That&rsquo;s <em>real</em> freedom.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What precisely are the mechanics and technicalities of a &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; of a valid license of a font? Given the finding that such a right is ethically and legally sound (<em>pace</em> any EULA to the contrary), how does it bear out in practice?</p>
<p>A traditional criterion might be the transfer of the physical media (i.e., disk) on which said font software was sold. Now that most fonts are sold via direct download, one might specify the original software file (customarily a .zip file containing font files, license, and supporting documentation). Personally, I do not see why anyone would pay for such a transfer (of a &ldquo;used&rdquo; font) in the absence of receiving these originating documents.</p>
<p>Would anyone like to share an anecdote regarding the transfer of font licenses?</p>
<p>Additionally, since some of the more savvy font vendors maintain records of purchased fonts, why couldn&rsquo;t a customer elect to transfer ownership to a different user within the system, after which the font would no longer be available for download by the original customer?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Khaled, what is wrong with &ldquo;creative&rdquo; individuals being able to capitalize digital products?
I reject the idea that intellectual property should not be productized, because it restricts me to generating income from fees or accessories (merchandise such as T-shirts). 
Why should the mass digital market not be open to individual content creators, and only to Big Silicon, with its hardware, major applications, and internet service provision? Micro-payment seems like an idea whose time will come.</p>
<p>This talk about &ldquo;fonts should be free&rdquo; (type designers, please find another way to make a living) occurs because it is easy to pirate fonts, and otherwise righteous folk who have done so feel called upon to justify their actions. There is also the Marxist critique. And the &ldquo;work is not art, only ideas are&rdquo; conceptual/curatorial perspective. And the &ldquo;all typefaces are just copies of other typefaces anyway&rdquo; camp. What all these have in common is those who don&rsquo;t get what my form of &ldquo;creative&rdquo; is, and/or don&rsquo;t value it, would like me to work for less, preferably for nothing. Thanks, but I prefer not to be a ragged-trousered philanthropist.</p>
<p>Sure, a certain amount of &ldquo;free&rdquo; (from piracy, free/share-ware, and bundling) is built into the font market presently and does to an extent catalyze and grease it. But it exists in balance with the typical font EULA. That is the nature of marketplaces, as Thomas and Nick have pointed out. Complex, homeostatic.</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like to live in a world where property is theft, but that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be practical. Please don&rsquo;t pick on type designers as your scapegoat for this shortcoming. This is a fledgling creative industry that should be encouraged.</p>

<p>The usual &ldquo;non-transferrable&rdquo; clause just means you can&rsquo;t transfer the license without the foundry. I a pretty sure that many foundries will agree to transfer a license on request.</p>
<p><cite>Personally, I do not see why anyone would pay for such a transfer (of a &ldquo;used&rdquo; font) in the absence of receiving these originating documents.</cite></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you need the foundry. They will send the original licensee a form where they agree to the transfer and agree to delete all the files. The new licensee will be treated as if they had bought the license directly from the vendor.</p>
<p>A good example would be the new webfonts. A webdesign studio might buy licenses of a couple of webfonts from FSI and suggest them to a client. Once the client chooses one, this font license would then be transfered to the client with aproval from FSI.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I want to see an example of this fictional business model where, I as the designer, can make more money giving away fonts than I can make selling them. I&rsquo;ve given away over 100,000 free for personal use license fonts on various sites and haven&rsquo;t made a plug nickle. Now, I&rsquo;m not stupid enough to think that these fonts are not ending up on commercial layouts. I&rsquo;m also not stupid enough to think that these designers aren&rsquo;t getting paid while using my fonts. So, where are my big profits. I&rsquo;ve got an electrric bill due soon.</p>
<p>Personally, I find some of the EULAs draconian (gotta love that word.) Simple solution, don&rsquo;t buy from those designers/foundries and choose a different font. On the other hand, I wish that I could come up with a font or family that I could sell for such prices and folks would grumble about my EULAs.</p>

<p><em>As I already said,you cannot break contracts, in which you have not agreed. And if your EULA has absurd limitations, you should not wonder, if potential customers don’t agree</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which you have not agreed? Actually, you <strong>have agreed</strong> to it at the moment you purchase a license to the fonts, that is how most EULA&rsquo;s work. The act of purchasing it, is agreeing to the contract.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Back to the main question, apparently artists, unlike software developers, are not so interested in the idea of sharing and free software; you can see many talented programmers contributing to free software (and many end up being paid for doing that), but you can hardly find any artists, yet the very talented ones. Why is that, I don&rsquo;t know and I sincerely wish to know.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because those &ldquo;artists&rdquo; have a business to run, a house to pay and food to buy. You can&rsquo;t do that by sharing or giving your goods away for free, even if there could be a potential fee at some point down the line. You have to realise a lot of type designers are a one-man-business, they earn their living with selling their typefaces. Please explain how you imagine a type designer earning a living by open-sourcing their typefaces if those typefaces are their only source of income?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve no problem with people expressing their own rights on their own &ldquo;creations&rdquo;, but when they want to exchange those &ldquo;creations&rdquo; with my money, their rights stop and my rights begin. They are not doing me a favour, they are selling me a product and I, as a customer, have the very right to be concerned about my freedom.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, they are not selling you a product, but licensing it to you. Basically, you are <em>renting</em> it. As with any rented goods, you are never free to do what you want with it. If you want to <em>buy</em> a typeface to be able do everything you want with it, you could always try to acquire the rights to the design, but that would obviously cost you thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars/euros. :)</p>
<p><em>That was never the point, I can give a book to friend who would hand copy it, and I&rsquo;ve seen this happening (because the friend didn&rsquo;t even have enough money to photocopy it), the point is that that I&rsquo;ve the right and the freedom to share it.</em></p>
<p>Not really actually, as most books contain a disclaimer in the colophon stating something like this: &ldquo;No part of this book may be reproduced in any form by any electronic or mechanical means (including photocopying, recording, or information storage and retrieval) without permission in writing from the publisher&rdquo;. Whenever it says something like that, you do not have the right and freedom to share it in the way you describe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I&rsquo;m talking and advocating free software; a software model in which you can make money in many different ways other than over charging your users or forcing draconian licensing rules on them.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overcharging? If you can&rsquo;t afford a particular product, then you find an alternative that you can afford! This is true for every product, including typefaces. I really can&rsquo;t see why typefaces or software in general should be any different.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">There are very, very few type designers who can charge higher than market prices and still make money. Those few make much, much more than the typical typeface designer. They are a combination of very good, very famous, and very well marketed. There are enough people who are willing to pay their asking price that they have no need to worry about selling to &ldquo;starving minimally employed graphic designers&rdquo; and students. I don&rsquo;t see this as any more of a problem than buying a Ferrari. Sure, I would like to have one of the hideously expensive cars but I cannot even afford to dream about it so I don&rsquo;t. I buy the typically priced car and drive it until it dies. Is the new Ferrari worth 50 times more than my 10 year old Volkswagon Jetta? Probably not. Would it be sensible for me to buy one anyway? Surely not. Does that amount of head-turning appeal, cache, gloat-ability,  wrongly perceived Babe-Magnetism or studly penis-envy make the car justifiable for theft? Not to me. I know I can&rsquo;t have all the toys that look amusing in the world. Like most people, I know the rich kids get the most expensive toys, and I could care less. Would I like it if my fonts sold at high prices? Sure I would. oh well, such is life. My VW gets me there and back just the same and I don&rsquo;t have to worry about where I park it.</div>

<p>A license is a document that tells you what you can and cannot do with a product. If you have not agreed to the licence (i.e. by downloading the product) you don&rsquo;t have any rights to use the product at all, because those haven&rsquo;t been granted to you.</p>

<p>In my opinion especially the comment with the Helveticons in the beginning of the thread was really embarrassing and abhorrent, especially because at that point of time nobody could know, that the topic starter of this topic is the son of a rich man.

<p>So, basically you just pick and choose which laws you like and which laws you don&rsquo;t like. Firstly, that is a very weak argument. Secondly, how is depriving a type designer of their income by downloading their work for free moral? And lastly, we should be glad that not everybody picks and chooses which laws they like to follow.</p>

<p>Copyright isn&rsquo;t exclusively concerned with money (though remedies for copyright violations frequently are). Copyright asserts the designer’s right to control the distribution of their intellectual property. If a designer has opted to only distribute their font to people who have purchased a license, what gives you the right to flout these terms and make use of their font against their express wishes? The fact that you are using it for &lsquo;private use&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t seem morally relevant to me.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t equate unlicensed use of a font with stealing a ferrari anymore than I equate stealing a ferrari with killing babies, but this has no ethical relevance. The fact that action X isn&rsquo;t the same as action Y where action Y is clearly bad has no bearing on the defensibility of action X.</p>
