body: "<strong>FontLab Studio 5.1 Public Preview 1 for Mac OS X is now available for
  all users of FontLab Studio 5!</strong>\r\n\r\nThis version is compatible with Mac
  OS X 10.7 Lion, and can also be used on Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and 10.6 Snow Leopard.
  It is a 32-bit Universal (Intel & PowerPC) Carbon application for Mac OS X.\r\n\r\nIf
  you own a license and a valid serial number for FontLab Studio 5 for Mac, you can
  download and install FontLab Studio 5.1 Public Preview 1 for Mac free of charge.
  Once released, FontLab Studio 5.1 will be a free update to all users of FontLab
  Studio 5, so if you don't have a license for FontLab Studio 5, you can purchase
  one now, and install either the current FLS 5.0.4 or the new FLS 5.1 PP1.\r\n\r\nTo
  download and install FontLab Studio 5.1 Public Preview 1 for Mac:\r\n\r\n1. Visit
  <strong><a href=\"http://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio-public-preview-b99.0/\">http://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio-public-preview-b99.0/</a></strong>\r\n\r\n2.
  Click on the board topic with the title:\r\n\"DOWNLOAD info for FontLab Studio 5.1
  Public Preview for Mac (Lion-compatible)\"\r\n\r\n3. Read the entire post carefully,
  download the application and install it.\r\n\r\nSince FontLab Studio 5.0.4 no longer
  works on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, we will be publishing the intermediate \"Public Preview\"
  builds for all users of FontLab Studio 5 who need an Intel-native version of the
  product until FontLab Studio 5.1 for Mac is officially released. FLS 5.1 PP1 is
  the only version of FLS which runs on 10.7, so if you're running Lion, you'll probably
  want to install it. If you're running 10.5 or 10.6, you can install FLS 5.1 Public
  Preview along your existing FLS 5.0.4, and use them both at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe
  Public Preview version has \"beta status\", i.e. it may not be fully-functional
  in some aspects. However, most functionality of the application is fine at this
  point.\r\n\r\nWe apologize for any inconvenience that this release schedule is causing
  to our users. FontLab Studio is a large, complex application. Moving the FontLab
  Studio code to the Intel platform and making it compatible with Lion has been a
  significant effort on which a team of developers and testers has been working for
  many months. We hope that the Public Preview builds will satisfy most of our customer
  needs for the time being, and we are actively working towards an official final
  release.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"
