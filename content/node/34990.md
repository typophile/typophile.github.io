    opinion none the less."

    set (and well) with the bottom horizontal line set on the baseline: certainly
    <em>all shrunken and superscripted</em> wouldn''t be an option I''d choose....'

  body: 'Thinking aboyt your question some more I would have to say no - there isn''t
    just one best way to set it or to design it. The # varies quite a bit from font
    to font. Some of the best designed ones vary a great deal from each other & make
    sense in the context of the font they are in. But that also brings me back to
    my earlier question. Some fonts don''t have such a wonderful # sign. And if you
    are using one you might be tempted to poke at it. But In general I would suggest
    using a font whose glyph set works, even the #. Then you don''t have to muck around...
    Does this make sense to you?'

    fonts don't have \"wonderful\" anything, Eben.  ;-)  \r\n\r\nCould you post an
    example of what you consider to be a \"great\" font with a \"not great\" octothorp?
    \ I admit that it's not the first character I look at in a specimen, but I have
    yet to find a stinker in any font that I would use otherwise...."

  body: While we've got the topic open, how does one distinguish between this symbol
    and a musical sharp (within the same, nonmusical font)? Should they be the same,
    or skewed differently, or whatnot?

    lovley font but you just don't love one of the glyphs too... Which ones? I don't
    recall - but I can look at them & let you know. I don't expect everybody to agree.
    But it will be interesting to see if they do or not & why.\r\n\r\nThanks Vince!"

    and superscript is all I can think of.\r\n\r\nI think of #1 BESTSELLER for say,
    a Tom Clancy book - and it is always prominent on the cover, uptop and center.
    Then the words like <em> The New York Time s</em> Bestseller - normally in all
    caps is divided among the oversized 1 \r\n\r\nI can't begin to tell you how many
    times as a typesetter it was set that way....\r\n\r\nIn text, I just go with the
    # sign of the font I'm in, however, trouble in today's type - the number sign
    is made as a full character, and we are getting very use to seeing it as #1 and
    don't think twice about it -- and so many think inch marks are quote marks and
    foot marks are apostrophies....\r\n\r\nDon't get me started..."

  body: "In the 'NUMBER SIGN' (U+0023, #), the \"horizontal\" lines are usually perfectly
    or nearly-perfectly horizontal while the \"vertical\" lines are slightly slanted
    forwards. The symbol is usually as wide as the figures or the currency symbols,
    and the lines are typically of equal thickness even in a typeface that has a modulated
    stroke: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0000.pdf\r\n\r\nIn the 'MUSIC
    SHARP SIGN' (U+266F, \u266F), the \"vertical\" lines are usually perfectly vertical
    and the \"horizontal\" lines are slanted upwards. The symbol is often narrower
    than the number sign, and the horizontal lines are usually thicker than the verticals.

  body: "Adam, that's interesting. I've just checked contemporary faces like Garamond
    Premier Pro, Stag, Meta Serif, Karmina and found thick horizontals on the octothorp.
    Do you think this trend has perhaps come about through conflating the # and the
    \u266F, or do typographers these days prefer a contrasted octothorp?"
