  (see critique > sans), consistent. Delicious by Jos Buivenga instantly comes to
  mind. It seems to me, that due to kerning, it's impossible to keep widths exactly
  consistent. Does anyone of you have experience with this?\r\n1. Is there any use
  to a font in which the widths are 'almost' (due to differences in kerning) consistent
  in width through different weights? \r\n2. What are prime examples of fonts width
  consistent width in different weights?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJasper de Waard"

  body: "For reasons of mechanical efficiency, the Linotype system introduced two-character
    matrices in 1898.\r\nThe two characters were in fact the same character (we now
    call them glyphs), but in different styles -- usually roman and italic of the
    same weight, or regular and bold roman.\r\nTherefore, each letter of the font
    shared its width with the corresponding character of the other font.\r\n\r\nAnd
    so, many typefaces that were published by Linotype in the early 20th century had
    identical character widths in regular and bold weights. However, their digital
    versions might not conform to the original specification.\r\n\r\nThis equivalence
    of weight width was useful to typographers in settings such as classified advertising
    and charts.\r\nConsistency of width across weight is still much used today for
    tabular figures, with genres such as financial reports in mind.\r\n\r\nHope I
    got that right, Kent!\r\n\r\nBTW, you might find David Consuegra's book useful,
    in particular his timeline.\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=consuegra+type&x=0&y=0\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Nick. Is it not useful for a typographer to be able to switch weights
    (other than tabular figures) without having to change things because it doesn't
    fit anymore? I don't want to base the design of the glyphs on their width. That's
    why I asked if it's useful to have a font with 'almost' consistent width. Are
    there any fonts out there that have consistent width through all weights, but
    don't use the 'two-character matrices' or anything alike (in other words: have
    a design that is not influenced in shape, only in width, by the concept of consistent
    width) ?\r\nI hope I'm clear enough."

    it\u2019s useful, but only under certain circumstances. If a complex document
    is going to be tweaked a whole lot during the design it\u2019s nice to not have
    paragraphs reflow. I\u2019m not sure how common a situation like this really is;
    I don\u2019t see publication designers clamoring for families with matching widths.
    \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re going to do this you should probably plan out a family
    from scratch and test prototype fonts for the entire family before you undertake
    designing entire fonts. That way you won\u2019t get to the bold/italic fonts and
    find that you have to go back and make major changes to the work you already did.
    Also, it would probably help you to read Stanley Hess\u2019 book <em>The Modification
    of Letterforms</em> to help you understand how to plan out a type system. "

  body: "Thanks guys. I just found out Actium has the same width across weights!\r\n@Dunwich:
    I don't think it's really as hard as you make it sound. The different eights should
    already have a lot proportions in common, so the differences won't be that big
    I guess. I might be wrong though. I'm just a roockie after all. To honest I've
    found most books on typedesign and/or typography quite disappointing, but I'll
    have a look at the book you suggested. I don't want the italics to get the same
    width too."

  body: "The concept of Grades \u2014 such as you find in Font Bureau\u2019s Readability
    Series (<a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Quiosco/\">Quiosco</a>, for
    instance) or in some H&FJ workhorses (like <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_features.php?featureID=1&productLineID=100017\">Mercury
    Text</a>, for example) \u2014 is built upon consistent widths across all grade
    variants.\r\n\r\nThis does not usually extend to the Bold weight, however.\r\n\r\nOne
    exception might be <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/newspaper/fonts/agate/PoynterAgate/\">Poynter
    Agate</a>, where I think the consistent widths apply to all weights, as well as
    all grades, in a style (since an agate type is typically employed in tabular material,
    like stock listings or sports scores). \r\n\r\nIf I recall correctly, when Akira
    Kobayashi created his version of <a href=\"http://linotype.com/135960/metrooffice-family.html\">Metro
    Office</a> (based on Dwiggins\u2019s Metro design), he put all styles on a single
    set of widths, mimicking the duplexing of metal Linotype designs. I\u2019m not
    sure this feature has much real value.\r\n\r\nBeyond these limited situations,
    I\u2019m not certain about any real practical value to consistent widths across
    a broad weight spectrum. Seems like a lot of sacrifice might be necessary. And
    I can\u2019t think of any practical value to having them \u201Cclose but not quite,\u201D
    unless it just happens that way.\r\n\r\nBut maybe it would be an interesting gimmick.
    The proof will be in the design.\r\n\r\n"

    Linotype face:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/two_letter_5076.jpg]\r\n\r\nAs
    can be seen, the usual case is to put the regular form of the face on the matrix
    with the italic. Small caps are on two-letter matrices as well, but with the numerals
    and ligatures, so sometimes a two-letter matrix can have two different characters
    on it, instead of two different styles of the same character.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it is true that bold sometimes also shared the matrix with the normal weight:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/two_letter2_3769.jpg]\r\n\r\nbecause
    there were purposes for which bold, rather than italic, would be mixed with the
    text.\r\n\r\nItalics having the same width as plain is almost a defining characteristic
    of Linotype faces; as setting requiring roman, italic and bold is also common,
    I think some faces also had a wider bold on one-letter matrices that were put
    into an attachment to the Linotype machine to allow it to have a wider selection
    of characters."

  body: "I had missed this. FWIW, I call this \"unwidth\". I think it's definitely
    an advantage... as long as it doesn't cause more important things to go off. It's
    good because if you want to change the style of even just a snippet of your text
    after you've made everything look nice it can make all the difference. There are
    some other fringe advantages too, for example in some kinds of animated text.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is that beyond a certain weight range the character of the design -arguably
    more important than the advantages above- goes off. Looking at Else* I have to
    say that the -resultant- width difference between the Light and the Bold is too
    much. But strangely enough in Axia** it doesn't seem so bad... It might have to
    do with how strong the character of the design is: Else is pretty generic, so
    it can't handle the width difference, while Axia is pretty distinctive so the
    width difference doesn't overpower its character. Maybe.\r\n\r\n* http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/else-npl/\r\n**
    http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/axia/\r\n\r\nAnother thing that might
    suffer too much between very different weights is apparent size; for example you
    rarely want a passage in Bold looking <em>smaller</em> than a Light it's embedded
    in or next to. Look how much bigger Else's Light looks than its Bold.\r\n\r\nBTW
    Jasper, I see no advantage to \"almost uniwidth\".\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/91519\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/61252\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Oh yeah - thanks.  :-)\r\n\r\nBTW I've previously mentioned what I consider
    to be the \"best compromise solution\" to the problem I stated above, but this
    is a good place to repeat it: make the cluster of weights that are pretty close
    to the Regular uniwidth, and make the outlying weights a fixed tracking amount
    away from that.* In this way the design of the outlying weights isn't notably
    compromised, but <em>if</em> the user has a strong need to maintain linebreaks
    (or wants to do some overlay/fading animation) he can decide to sacrifice the
    spacing a bit to achieve that. I've been calling this \"fixed offset\" spacing.\r\n\r\n*
    I've done that in Nour&Patria, where the Regular and Demi are uniwidth, while
    the Light/Bold are +10/-10 tracking units away from them. BTW Nina and I almost
    managed to pull it off for Ernestine(&Vem) where the difference between each step
    was going to be 13 units, but it became too much of a time hog.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
