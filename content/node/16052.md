    that one!\r\n\r\nIt's worse as you need to use the numeric keypad to type the
    number - so if you have a laptop - ouch. An alternative in Office apps is to type
    the Unicode code point 212E and then hit ALT X and it converts it into the character.\r\n\r\n>I
    forgot to mention I am on a Mac.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested in how you get to it
    on the Mac - esp. if they let you do it in less than five/six keystrokes - that
    would be clever.\r\n\r\n"

    you can use the Character Palette (which can be enabled via the International
    control panel) to insert it. Note, this only will work in more recent applications.
    If you have the Adobe CS apps, you can use the Glyph palette in a similar way.

    or this one: \u212E \r\nThen go and paste it in your CS app, and switch the font.
    Note that very few fonts will have the symbol; only certain OpenType fonts contain
    it. The System fonts should have it, for example.\r\n\r\nI agree with Si: Let's
    please avoid another salvo in the Mac v Windows war. They're both good. They're
    both bad. They're both wonderful. They're both frustrating. They're both imperfect,
    because only Allah is perfect..."

    symbol from a Wikipedia website and paste it into my documents as needed:  \u2248\r\nFrom
    my own keyboard, best substitute I've found is the isomorphism symbol, a single
    wavy line over an equal sign that can be accomplished in the font 'Symbol\" by
    striking the @ sign (capital 2).  Second option is the equivalent symbol, a single
    wavy line on the capital key under your esc key upper left on your keyboard. "
