  make them matching tees for some tournament, and I'd prefer to use the same (awful)
  fonts. Any insight to both fonts on here would be appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n-SB"

  body: "PIRANHAS looks like a slightly edited version of <A href=\"http://www.dafont.com/space-up-yer-life.font?nb_ppp=50&text=PIRANHAS\">\"Space
    up Yer Life\"</a> by Stick Fonts. The basic details are right, but a few letters
    look like they've been distorted. Probably close enough for this purpose.\r\n\r\n-
