  body: "\r\nThey have used Cufon to embed that typeface into that page. You would
    have to do the same as the typeface is not that common, and therefore will not
    be installed on many end users computers.\r\n\r\nThe Typeface is called 'Swiss
    721' at regular (400) weight.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps."
