    little, if I find myself a few pennies better off, I'll buy myself a copy!"

  body: "I agree the poster doesn't look great. A solid colored background would do
    the typeface more justice than this yellow paper background. I would avoid using
    outer glow as well.\r\n\r\nThe typeface itself however is very clever. I especially
    like b/e/h/q, where the stroke causes an indent in the stem where it wants to
    connect."

  body: And why not include 2 "half" fonts which you can use on top of each other
    to have one half of the font in a different color, like the black/white letters
    in your promo pictures?

  body: "Thank you for the comments, Martin. I like your suggestion of making 2-half
    fonts, as alternate variations, to get the 2-color look I created using Illustrator
    in my poster. Actually, that did occur to me as I was working on the promotional
    poster. Not sure how many customers for that kind of font(s), although something
    to consider down-the-road, perhaps. My thinking is that graphic artists would
    prefer to experiment and create these type of variations themselves, on the fly,
    as I did. But, maybe you are right! I think I'll give it a try. Thanks again.\r\n\r\nOn
    another note, I wonder if a type design concept like this would be desirable for
    a true italic version as well? How about other weights, small caps or old style
    figures, etc.\u2014as well as, other \u201Cfeature\u201D sets? I guess I could
    keep experimenting, with other variations, if this font becomes successful.\r\n\r\nAny
    other ideas or suggestions appreciated. Thanks, again!"
