  to identify the fancy 'M' in the middle. It looks a lot like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/surrey/|Surrey]],
  except that the actual letter doesn't look the same. I've browsed through the family
  on myfonts and can't find the style pictured, and I've seen work using the same
  font on another designer's site so I'm convinced it's a typeface. Perhaps there's
  another style of this one that I'm missing? I've googled and haven't found anything.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help :)"

    so I think I'm just going to buy the fonts and put them together in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the links though, Stephen, I love Jewel Saphyr and Pearl. Definitely going
    on my wishlist. Cheers :)"
