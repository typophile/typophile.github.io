body: "I'm designing (actually revising) a series of brochures for the state department
  of health that must be produced in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese. As of now both
  the English and Spanish are set in Novarese and the Vietnamese is in Bodoni -- they
  are all currently produced in Quark.\r\n\r\nMy question is, if I build the new versions
  in InDesign and use OpenType Pro fonts (Adobe Garamond Pro, Myriad Pro, etc...)
  will the translation process be easier and more visually consistent. I'm somewhat
  new to the multiple languages bit, so please let me know if more information is
  needed.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAddison"

  body: Well you don't have to deal with German. German words are like a sentence
    in English. Very hard to deal with if you can't hypenate words. I wouldn't be
    concerned with English, Spanish but I haven't a clue about how Vietnamese sets.
    Unless you are using the most recent version of Quark I would believe InDesign
    will make the typesetting better looking.

  body: "Nope, no German, but to me, Vietnamese isn't much better. Lots of accents.
    And it may be that this is something called English-Vietnamese -- I really don't
    know.\r\n\r\nI suppose one of my bigger questions is this: what opentype pro fonts
    are capable of Vietnamese?\r\n\r\nThe translation will actually be handled by
    someone else."

  body: "Thanks, David. Vietnamese postscript fonts are what I'm trying to avoid,
    but I'll contact them to see if they can help.\r\n\r\nMany opentype fonts can
    do multiple languages, but Vietnamese appears to be rare. Adobe's <a href=\"http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1738.html\">Garamond
    Premier Pro</a> (it's in one of the PDFs) looks like it can handle Vietnamese
    -- any others?"

  body: "I agree -- and the Bodoni they use now just hurts. I certainly can't read
    it, but all of the accents make it looked as though someone spilled ground black
    pepper on the brochure...\r\n\r\nAny font suggestions, Hrant?"
