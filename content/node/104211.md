  or squished, as if a big boulder were sitting on top of it.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know
  of a font that achieves this look?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance to anyone who replies!"

  body: "If you literally want it to look squashed, another approach would be to reduce
    the vertical scale of the letters using InDesign or PhotoShop. But you'd be ruining
    the font's proportions so it's not a technique you'd want to use except to create
    a special effect.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flattened_4511.jpg]"
