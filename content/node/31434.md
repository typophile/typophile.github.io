  with my students of the multimedia course in a project that intents to produce a
  45 to 60 minutes video about the history of typography, to be distributed for free,
  and it will be the first of its kind in portuguese language.\r\nI'm starting to
  create the storyboard and I want to know your opinion on what should appear in such
  film, main structure, typographers, typefaces, and so on.\r\n\r\nDino dos Santos\r\nDSType"

    as in design and space OR the letterforms OR both? "

  body: "I know.\r\n\r\nI would like it to be both!\r\n\r\nI have a movie on type
    history (in english), and I understand that there are several ways to do this.\r\nIn
    that movie the calligraphers are never mentioned, and I think it's important for
    the students to understand the importance of calligraphy to the history of type
    itself.\r\nIt's also possible to establish a relationship between type and technology
    (stone, lead type, monotype, linotype, computers) but that's not the main issue
    I wish to see in the movie.\r\n\r\nI need to establish a timeline:\r\n\r\n1. Evolution
    of the alphabet from the Phoenicians to the Romans.\r\n2. The roman styles\r\n3.
    The carolingian minuscules\r\n4. The middle age\r\n5. Movable type + Gutenberg\r\n\r\n...
    and so on...\r\n\r\nWhat I want is my fellow typophiles opinion about what should
    be relevant or not to a movie like this.\r\n\r\nI'm very excited because I have
    great students that ignore type history and it's a shame.\r\nThis is a major chance
    for them to understand type, in their native language, and absolutely for free

  body: Which movie do you have on type history in English? I am intrigued. You've
    got quite a challenging project by the way.

  body: "Professor Jennifer Steinkamp had put together a timeline and highlights of
    development and history of typography on a website called <a href=\"http://users.design.ucla.edu/~cariesta/designhistory/\"
    target=\"new\">Brief History of Typography</a>.\r\n\r\nYou can use it as a starting
    point on how you might organize the content bringing the viewer along a chronological
    path. Of course there are other conventions you could use. I'm trying to find
    a link I once had with another timeline (in German) which paralleled cultural
    and polictal movements with the history of type.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Garamond_portrait1_6137.gif]"

    which he illustrated six social occasions that centre on a paper and printing.
    All in the 17th century.\r\n\r\n1. The Enclosure -- in a garden, a lady reads
    a love letter that her beau has just given her\r\n2. The Letter -- in a busy office,
    the boss dictates a letter to his secretary\r\n3. The Book -- in a busy market
    square, readers peruse a bookstall\r\n4. The Broadside\r\n5. The Calendar -- in
    a print shop, the publisher confronts the printer, pointing at the calendar, his
    job is overdue\r\n6. The Menu -- an aristocratic dinner party."

  body: "Thanks Norbert for pointing that. I think it might be usefull.\r\n\r\nThe
    social aspect of type is important Nick, but I don't know if we can go that way
    in the movie. We can try but in a more graphic way (introducing some events and
    dates). Low resources, no budget ;^(\r\n\r\nGeorg... I don't know what to say.
    Your offer is unique and I'll surely contact you later.\r\n\r\n\r\nDino"
