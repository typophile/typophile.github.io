    with some good things. Do it cleanly with nice rich, vibrant colors. See if you
    can't get into Photoshop and get an illustrated look going. Also, I think city
    skylines and things of that nature were big back then so you might incorporate
    a skyline into your design somehow. \r\n\r\nHope that helps!"

    of that, but considered it "too obvious". Oprion, your poster makes me re-think
    -- it''s great!'
