  body: "I was even looking at this on FontShop a couple months back.  I suppose it
    takes a real-world connection to retain these things.\r\n\r\nBut speaking of FontShop,
    I notice Scangraphic often has a lot of these unique typefaces for a fraction
    of the price.  How does the quality match up to competitors such as Elsner+Flake?"

  body: "I think the quality is still good, just slightly different digitizations.
    Incidentally, E+F isn't much of a competitor because they now own Scangraphic.
    \r\n\r\nIncidentally again, Anna and I reviewed Stilla for <a href=\"http://printmag.com/design_articles/HotTypeStilla/tabid/260/Default.aspx\">Printmag.com</a>
    last month."
