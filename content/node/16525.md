  EOTS, based on numerous recommendations, and had a few questions on some of his
  guidelines and the justification used in the book itself.  \r\n\r\nI'm only on page
  42, but thus far, the following guidelines have been suggested: \r\n\r\n<cite>\r\n2.1.7
  Don't letterspace the lowercase without a reason.\r\n2.1.9 Don't alter the widths
  or shapes of letters without cause.\r\n2.4 Etiquette of Hyphenation and Pagination\r\n
  \   ... and no typesetting software should be permitted to compress, \r\n    expand
  or letterspace the text automatically and arbitrarily\r\n    as a means of fitting
  the copy.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nAll of the above seem to make perfect sense to me, especially
  tweaking a designers type by changing widths, even to a mere mortal, I wouldn't
  even consider such blasphemy.  However, he then points the reader to p.190 (section
  9.4) where he talks about the various software justification engines that are able
  to do letterspacing and glyph shaping.  He then proceeds to describe the min/max
  letterspacing and min/max glyph shaping settings he used in the book?!?  \r\n\r\nIs
  it me, or is he violating his own rules by using letterspacing and altering the
  widths of glyphs?  Perhaps, as a newcomer, I simply do not understand some of the
  terminology, but it seemed clear to me that the first two guidelines frown upon
  both letterspacing and glyph shaping.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I am also curious as
  to the general concensus of his use of justification in the book.  Before I started
  getting into the details of interword spacing, I thought the book was very readable.
  \ However, after reading only 42 pages, I am now continually distracted by the horrible
  interword spacing seen is some paragraphs.  On p.31 the following paragraph looks
  terrible:\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nA man who would letterspace lower case would steal sheep,
  Frederic Goudy liked to say.  If this wisdom needs updating, it is chiefly to add
  that a woman who would letterspace lower case would steal sheep as well.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nMy
  untrained eye still can't notice any glyph shaping occuring, but in the above paragraph,
  I can see the extra letterspacing and wordspacing with no problem whatsoever.  In
  some ways, I think I enjoyed the \"look\" of the book better when I was ignorant
  of these details.  Now, all I do as I read is concentrate on how the wordspacing
  is so inconsistent across lines.\r\n\r\nAm I just being overly critical because
  I've just recently been enlightened to some of the details of typography?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPete\r\n\r\nps
  On a side note, does anyone know if InDesign's paragraph composer has the same feature
  the TeX does concerning the amount of extra wordspace used on consecutive lines?
  \ If I recall, TeX will not put one line of text with an abnormal amount of extra
  wordspace next to another where the wordspace must be shrunk in the other extreme,
  thus limiting the contrasting amount of nearby wordspacing. \r\n"

  body: "It seems to me this isn't quite the contradiction you're implying. \r\n\r\nIn
    9.4 Bringhurst discusses and shows examples of various h+j settings, and outlines
    those used in <em>EOTS</em>. What he's outlining here are very specific rules
    set up in the h+j engine. \r\n\r\nIn 2.4, as you've quoted, he cautions that \"no
    typesetting software should be permitted to compress, expand or letterspace the
    text <em>automatically and arbitrarily</em> as a means of fitting the copy.\"
    \r\n\r\nCarefully testing and setting specific engine rules is not the same as
    permitting the software to \"automatically and arbitrarily\" fit the copy; on
    the contrary, fine-tuning the engine is the opposite of leaving the software to
    do whatever it thinks is best."

  body: "Pete, typographers have always cheated to squeeze copy to fit.\r\nThe trick
    is to do it cleverly enough to be unnoticeable to the reader, and also the professional
    eye.\r\n\r\nH&J software allows the typographer to cheat in several ways:\r\n-
    reduce letterspace (tracking)\r\n- reduce wordspace \r\n- reduce horizontal scale
    by a percentage\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with inconsistent wordspacing from
    line to line -- it allows an even fit between letters (tracking), which is most
    desirable.\r\n"

  body: "InDesign's paragraph composer uses primarily a combination of (1) a patented
    idea, the patent for which was bought from URW, (2) its own tweaks and modifications
    to that idea. There could be some influence from TeX either directly or indirectly,
    but I know it was not the primary source.\r\n\r\nI think what Bringhurst was opposed
    to was applications like Microsoft Word that don't let you specify much in terms

    body: "Thomas,\r\n\r\nThe URW hz program (a suite of algorithms that URW developed;
      I assume hz is the program that Bringhurst is referring to in Elements pg 190,
      192) was indeed heavily influenced by the Knuth-Plass algorithm. In fact, according
      to the  Seybold Report, Volume 22, Number 11, it directly used TeX for its paragraph-based
      line-breaking decisions [I assume that they mean it used the Knuth-Plass algorithm?].
      \r\n\r\nAs you correctly point out though, this is only part of what makes the
      hz program [and by extension InDesign] so powerful. The other microtypographic
      extensions incorporated into hz are important too.  The full text of the relevant
      Seybold report is available online [slightly mangled by my browser?] at: http://www.seyboldreports.com/SRPS/free/0ps22/ps22-11a.htm\r\n\r\nSome
      of the features of the hz algorithm are now available to the TeX world through
      pdfTeX. There is a nice discussion of these microtypographic extensions to TeX
      in Han The Thanh's Ph.D dissertation:\r\nhttp://www.pragma-ade.com/pdftex/thesis.pdf\r\n\r\nIs
      there any freely available discussion of Adobe's extensions to the URW algorithms?
      Or is it all a secret now? :)\r\n\r\nOne thing: the font expansion aspects of
      the hz algorithm really do beg for Multiple Master fonts. I do wish that you
      guys hadn't killed them off....\r\n\r\nGrant\r\n\r\n"

    rate these evils used to justify text: wordspacing, hyphenation, letterspacing,
    and glyph scaling.  Lets assume that moderate amounts of each are used: max M/2
    and min M/5 wordspacing, +/-3% letterspacing, +/-2% scaling.  I'm not sure how
    to quantify moderate amounts of hyphenation.\r\n"

    in InDesign the flyout arrow gives you the option of choosing the \"hyphenation
    settings\" dialogue box, which includes the powerful slider that makes a trade-off
    between better spacing and fewer hyphens. Where to put the slider and the other
    settings gives a way to quantify the setting.  \r\n\r\nI would also be interested
    in people's views on best practices and settings in InDesign on these issues.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Personally, I don't mind a fair bit of hyphenation, and prefer more even
    spacing. So I slide the slider all the way over to that extreme.\r\n\r\nIn pkazmier's
    example, I would not consider that rang of spacing options \"moderate.\" If the
    standard space in the font is M/4 (which is about average), then that corresponds
    to spacing settings of 80%/??%/200% in InDesign (I'd assume you'd put 100% in
    the middle, but maybe that's just me. Whereas I and most typographers tend to
    suggest settings like 80/100/133. Of course, a lot depends on context: maybe pkazmier
    is mostly setting newspaper text in narrow columns or something, requiring more
    extreme justification settings.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

      book with regards to word spacing.  After your post, I went back to confirm
      that I correctly posted the right numbers, but it seems that Bringhurst does
      suggest tighter numbers for text set at smaller sizes.  It says that a max of
      M/3 and min of M/4 would be better numbers to strive for.  Would these numbers
      be a considered moderate? And, would you consider the numbers I posted for letterspacing
      and glyph scaling as moderate, or are those also too generous?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPete\r\n"

    numbers above: \r\n\r\nI agree with Thomas, wordspacing = 80 / 100 / 133 (assuming
    a native word space of 250). The figures for letterspacing are too extreme in
    my book. I prefer -1 /  0 /  +1. These are starting points -- works fine maybe
    85% of the time; altered if necessary based on font, size, leading, margins, nature
    of text being set, etc., in order to satisfy my eye.\r\n\r\nI don't generally
    allow glyph scaling at all, by default. I will exercise it as the last resort
    on an ad hoc basis for particularly ornery paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIn terms of prioritization
    of the various parameters:\r\nHyphenation first, followed closely by Wordspacing
    -- actually the two in conjunction, the relative proportion depending upon the
    material being set; thankfully Indy allows movement between the two.\r\nLetterspacing
    only in small amounts, as noted above.\r\nGlyph scaling almost never, only as
    a last resort.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"
