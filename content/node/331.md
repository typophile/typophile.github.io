    web content using the qrk data server...  who are they trying to compete with
    on that?  macromedia, sun, microsoft, php.... are they looney. <BR> <BR>maybe
    the next version of amazon.com will be all done in quark..... <BR> <BR>and i do
    love ID... OT support is rad, and i hope it really takes off.  the comfy adobe

  body: <i> Worrying thing No. 1</i> <BR>hmmm, yes that&#39;s true, but all other
    spaces in InDesign &#40;ie hair space, thin space, en space, etc&#41; are also
    always non-breaking. So if there is really a big hole in your line, you can replace
    it with one of them and it still won&#39;t break. But indeed, it would be more
    practical if it would go along with the rest. And I also noticed that the non-breaking
    space keeps the same width when you increase/decrease the wordspace. <BR> <BR>What
    I need is a word counter! I know there exists one for windows, but it isn&#39;t
    available for Mac. There used to be a script in 1.5 who could do that, but it
    disappeared. <BR> <BR>And palettes that stick!  <BR> <BR>

  body: All native transparencies so far are problematic, as far as I know.  <BR>
    <BR>ID is a step beyond what current RIPs can do, as it works with a newer Acrobat
    code &#40;5, most RIPs use 4... with the next gen of Raster Image Processors there
    should be no problem anymore&#41; so transparencies and layers are a kind of problem,
    although not really in practice. ID produces perfectly nifty Acrobet 4-Files by
    changing part of the layout into bitmap-images. Sounds scary, I know -- but for
    Schauspielhaus Bochum I used lots of the then-completely-new layer technique in
    ID2 because there was basically no time to do the stuff in Photoshop -- Shading
    areas, multiplying layers, transparency FX, layering additive colours and so on...
    and was afraid as heck. Worked like a charm, no problem whatsoever with the Acrobat
    File. There was no change in color, fonts were crispy and all that. You can manually
    edit these changed what the German edition of ID calls Transparenzreduzierungsformate
    in the Edit-dropdown, so something along the line of Transparency and Reduction
    should be the right thing. :-&#41; Or you take -- for RIP-Output -- the HIGH predefined
    Quality in the printing dialogue. &#40;It just sounds difficult as I don&#39;t
    know the english terms, in fact its effing easy... sorry... &#41;

  body: <b>Worrying thing No. 1</b> <BR> <BR>While it&#39;s not as convenient as having
    a special non-breaking space that stretches with justification, you can get this
    effect by applying the &#34;No Break&#34; attribute from the Character palette
    menu to a normal space character or to the two or more words you don&#39;t want
    to have break across lines.

    word from Sun to SunSC &#40;Small Caps&#41;, the letters vanish and you get that

    related to the fact InDesign uses Unicode rather than platform encoding.  Try
    holding down the Command and Option keys &#40;Control and Alt on Windows&#41;
    when changing the font.  This will cause InDesign to attempt to mimic the behavior
