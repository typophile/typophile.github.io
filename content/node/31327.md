  February 2 near Roanoke, Va.  Mr. Arnold was a legendary typographer, editor, and
  publisher, who became a design consultant with great influence in the newspaper
  industry.  He was the author of several books, including \"Functional Newspaper
  Design\" (1956) and \"Ink on Paper\" (1971), both of which changed the way newspapers
  were designed.  Among other things, he advocated greater legibility, fewer columns
  (from 8 to 6! What a concept!), more photographs, and modern layout.  He had a big
  influence on newspapers such as the old New York Herald Tribune, Newsday, and the
  Chicago Tribune...and much later, the New York Times.  I remember reading Mr. Arnold's
  books while I was busy redesigning my high school paper in the 1960s.....There is
  a nice  obit for Mr. Arnold in today's Washington Post at:\r\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/08/AR2007020802133.html\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
  the NY Times chose only to run the AP wire obit.  Seems they still need to learn
  a few things about typography and design.\r\n\r\nKevin"
