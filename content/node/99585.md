    i take it you're asking about rendering quality. I don't have a lot of testing

  body: "From what I have bee able to gather, implementation of @font-face is problematic
    in some mobile apps (which is what your table shows, basically), so embedding
    seems the safer (fewer annoyed costumers) approach\u2014which covers the \u201Cpredictable\u201D
    part of the question.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes: the \u201Cclearly\u201D part of the question
    was in regard to rendering quality. There are a lot of excellent tools for testing
    font rendering in various browsers. but I haven't stumbled across one yet that
    compares rendering in mobile apps. From the buzz I am picking up from business
    types, more and more traffic that was formerly web-exclusive is anticipated to
    become pure mobile, so it seems to me that fonts-for-mobile is an emergent trend
    with a lot of possibilities\u2026"

  body: Nick, a lot of work in this area has to do with targeted development. There
    is quite a significant difference between the available mobile devices and developing
    a font for each of them hinges on a combination of factors, including the consideration
    of OS, physical size, resolution and screen type/rendering environment, e.g.,
    E Ink, LCD. As such it may not really be possible to have a one font fits all
    solution. The work that goes into optimising a font for an E Ink display would
    likely be of little or no benefit on a sharper colour LCD such as the one used
    on the iPhone/iPad or the HD Super AMOLED display used on the Samsung Galaxy SIII.

  body: "Karl,\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments. The issue is not so much developing
    fonts for a specific environment, but rather choosing the format that is most
    likely to render properly with the least number of problems.\r\n\r\nI developed
    most of my library with print use in mind and, even more specifically, with display
    use in print in mind. Consequently, a lot of my fonts track tight, which is okay
    for print, but is probably not ideal for webfont and mobile usage\u2014as in Ye
    Olden Days, \u201Ctelevision spacing\u201D was considerably looser than print
    spacing because of scan-line blur. Despite all of the whoop-ti-doo about improved
    screen resolutions and such, I am not entirely convinced that fonts developed
    for on-screen use shouldn\u2019t have wider sidebearings as a general rule. In
    consideration whereof, I was considering making separate versions of my fonts
    for print and on-screen use. And, it seemed more sensible to make one flavor of
    OTF the print version (given Postscript\u2019s long history with print, probably
    CFF), and the other the on-screen version (which kinda leaves TTF as default)."

  body: "You could develop everything in TrueType flavoured OT and then append the
    .ttf or .otf file extension depending on your target market. Unless you have a
    proven reason to supply CFF OT fonts to your customers, it would save you the
    hassle of developing and maintaining both varieties. The discussion around this
    issue over on TypeDrawers gives some interesting perspectives on the matter:\r\n\r\nhttp://typedrawers.com/discussion/200/reducing-font-family-bloat/p1\r\n\r\nIf
    it helps and you are experimenting with web font settings on a public site I would
    be happy to send or post screen grabs from an iPhone 4 or iPad 3, so that you
    can get a feel for how those are displaying. I would be very interested in the
    results of any tests.\r\n\r\n"
