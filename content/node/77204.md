  community letterpress printshop has evolved a bit into coming up with methods of
  self sufficiency, One of which is via our Etsy site offering items produced on premises
  using our collection as raw material. We have had great feedback regarding our printing
  of specimen sheets from some of our wood type dating back to the mid 1800s\r\n\r\nPardon
  the sales pitch, but these DO make great gifts for typophiles!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/il_570xN_4679.186721816.jpg]\r\n\r\nAll
  proceeds of sales help support the programs of the WNY Book Arts Center. Thank you.\r\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/wnybac?section_id=6165159"
