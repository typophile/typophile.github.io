  I've seen this 'e' in a spa's name, among other places. Its bar is a curve that
  begins to the left of the rest of the letter, like so:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wtf_3419.png]\r\n\r\nOnly
  it's more elegant than that. The curve tapers to a point, and I believe the other
  end of the 'e' does as well. Any ideas?"
