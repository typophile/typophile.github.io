  body: You will probably find some helpful advice in [[http://typophile.com/node/13840|Typophile's
    collection of End User License Agreement (EULA) discussions]]. If you can find
    an example of an existing EULA that fits the terms and conditions you are looking
    for to cover your own fonts you should then consult legal advice on how to implement
    it and to understand how it is supported in the event of a breach. The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement|Wikipedia
    page on EULAs]] is quite informative as well.
