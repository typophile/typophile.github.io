  body: "It appears to be (very nice) artwork based upon an old typeface digitized
    by Lime as <a href='http://www.dafont.com/extra-ornamental.font' target='_blank'>Extra
    Ornamental No. 2</a>. As such, I don't think a font was directly used.\r\n\r\nThis
    appears in the Solotype Catalog (metal, wood and photo type) as Tuscan Floral."

    as seen in Gray's _19th Century Ornamented Typefaces_. Later sold in the U.S.
    by James Conner's & Sons.\r\nDon"

    the reproduction in F.W. Lambert's _Letter Forms (1964)_ of the full alphabet
    of Extra Ornamented No.2 as produced by Stevens Shanks circa 1900. Here is the
