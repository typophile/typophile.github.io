body: "It's been a while that I wanted to try and create a <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/contribute.html\">search
  plugin</a> for Firefox/Mozilla. The linked site mentions it has to be a \"GET\"
  method page, but since Typophile's search function doesn't show anything in the
  URL, I'm not even sure it's possible.\r\n\r\nSo, Punchcut people, is it possible?
  Or is Typophile's super-search too much for poor Mozilla to handle? :)\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:
  I wrote the code for the search and tried <a href=\"http://www.mindzilla.com/auditform.php\">testing</a>
  it but as expected it didn't work. If anyone thinks this is an interesting idea,
  I'll gladly post the code here (it's simple and short)."

    for Safari. I wonder where that went. I have it at the office. I'll post the link
    tomorrow.

    the Typophile OS X Widget- it too needed a GET method instead of POST. I spoke
    with Christian about it and I got the impression there was a security reason for
    handling it so.\r\n\r\nGrant's workaround used Google to search the site. \r\n\r\nI'll
    follow up with CR again to see what the verdict is/was.\r\n\r\nJared\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Miss Tiff, do you mean the Bookmark with the \"Search Typophile\" popup?
    I have that too, and it works in FF as well, but I wanted to try and avoid Google
    since the Typophile search looks so much better :)\r\n\r\nJared, thank you. I'm
    on a PC so I've never tried the Widget. Maybe the workaround used for it would
    work for this too? The Mozilla search plugin is Sherlock-based."
