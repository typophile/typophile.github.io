  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello people, <BR>these are roughs for a poster about a play in theater called &#34;the child&#34;, written by the Norwegian Jon Fose &#40;propably this is not the correct spelling but I have his name only in greek&#41;. <BR> <BR>The play starts at a bus station where some people are waiting, including a man and a woman who like each other. The next scenes are showing the life of the couple, where the distance between them is growing more and more. <BR> <BR>The subjects that the play is touching, are the gap between people, the emptyness of the relations, the luck of communication and the unspoken words as the unborn child of the couple.  <BR> <BR>The writer himself says that the most important of his plays, is the pause... <BR> <BR>So, there are the solutions I gave for the moment, and I am expecting your views. <BR> <BR>Fonts used: Base, DIN, CF Ray<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6934.jpg" alt="poster1"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6935.jpg" alt="poster2"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6936.jpg" alt="poster3a"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6937.gif" alt="poster3b"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">So, these are the proposals i will send to the cliend. I thought about the earthquake Hrant, but it seems to me it won&#39;t help since earthquake includes the element of trembling, opposite to the stillness of the play. As for the &#34;x&#34; i disagree because i think is suitable to symbolize the canceled process of pregnacy, plus is a strong mark and i need something strong in that part of the poster. <BR> <BR>Colin I tried the xeroxing first thing in the morning and i end up with the lettering in the 2nd poster. Though i am not sure for the lettering  result &#40;maybe they look like lettering for a horror movie&#41;, this is the poster i believe in. It will be pitty if the clients will insist to put color &#40;i am sure they will ask&#41;. In that case i would rather chose the 3d poster. <BR> <BR>Thank you all for your advises. Of course the work didn&#39;t finish so i would be happy with more comments <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6971.jpg" alt="poster1"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6972.jpg" alt="poster2"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6973.jpg" alt="poster3"> <BR> <BR>PS. don&#39;t pay attention to the yellow-gray border...supposed to be the wall behind...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">incredibly anal nitpik: The &#39;X&#39; seems to be closer to her stomach than her uterous. <BR> <BR>I think Hrant&#39;s comment regarding the earthquake wan&#39;t meant to be literal. I think it had to wo with the rough line turning into a clean line at the umbilical cord. I think the way you have it works great on the second poster, but the differing line qualities are a bit too much on the first poster when you add in all of the other elements. <BR> <BR></div>
