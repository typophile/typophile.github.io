    with the advent of [[OpenType]], you can't really say that anymore."

  body: "Yes, Paul, I agree that OpenType has given the capability for a huge number
    of ligatures and other glyphs, but so far the number of these fonts is rather
    small, and not widely in use (partly because using them requires OT-smart applications).
    I was going more with the odds in making that comment.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has tried
    to see Ministry, as I just have, you find that when you type 'the' in Flont, you
    do get something joined, but not anything like the posted sample. If there is
    another form of this letter combination embedded in the font, how is one ever
    to know this without owning the font? From a buyer/IDer perspective this seems
    to be another disadvantage of the OT format. The number of puzzled comments I
    get from people who want to get Bickham Script Swashes, proves to me that there
    is a long way to go for OT acceptance and understanding.\r\n\r\nI doubt that Ministry
    Script is the source of this, because the style seems not to agree with the sample,
    although I can't prove anything with what I can see on Veer. It would be much
    easier to make conclusions if we had a few more words in this lettering.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "You can get the PDF from Veer, Mike. But you're right about the sampler.
    Two things need to happen for OpenType to gain wide acceptance:\r\n\r\n<strong>1.
    Online samplers that incorporate features and full character sets.</strong> That's
    doable for the small foundries like Underware who can create <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=bello&id2=swashes\">animations</a>
    and demos for each of their fonts, but the major resellers will have to plow a
    lot of R&D into their samplers to make them OT-savvy.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Microsoft
    support.</strong> The company that co-developed OpenType still doesn't fully support
    it in their flagship products, namely Office. While I would never design something
    in Word, the sad fact is that many still do. And an OpenType font with special
    features or characters can never work as a corporate font. That's a serious problem.
    Especially when you're talking about the basics, like figure variations and small
    caps."

    but with all the alternates, I need to take a closer look. In the meantime take
    a look at the second sample. Thanks.\r\n"

    Induestries]] does? (but i seem to be having trouble using it today, is it just
    me?)\r\n\r\nand on topic: i don't believe this is Ministry. "

    Le Gates</a> from the Blumelin Scripts collection, most likely modified in Illustrator
    or a similar application to make it join up properly.
