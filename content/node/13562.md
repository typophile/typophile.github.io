body: "Two Books and One Exhibition.\r\n\r\nEdited and curated by [[Peter Bain]] and
  [[Paul Shaw]].\r\n\r\nThe books/exhibition deal with the history of [[Blackletter]]
  typefaces, the nationalist tendencies that became associated with them, and those
  typefaces that were intended to embody this.\r\n\r\nThe first monograph, published
  by Princeton Architectural Press, is a series of essays contributed by authors such
  as Hans Peter Willberg and Christopher Burke; the second book is the exhibition
  catalogue, published by the American Printing History Association as part of its
  journal <em>Printing History</em>. Copies of the monograph are available from [[Peter
  Bain]] and [[Paul Shaw]].\r\n\r\nThe exhibition was held in 1998 at the Herb Lubalin
  Study Center of Design and Typography at [[Cooper Union]]."
