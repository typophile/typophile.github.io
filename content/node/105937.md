  body: "These are light and thin faces, but how are they related to the norm?\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me that there are three categories of light weight:\r\n\r\n1. Light versions
    of a stylistically themed family\r\n2. Light fonts that look like light versions
    of regular styles, but are not published as part of a specific family.\r\n3. Light
    weight standalone fonts\r\n\r\nMorris Benton is often credited with introducing
    the concept of the type family, during the amalgamation that created ATF, as a
    means of organizing duplication.\r\n\r\nThe Klingspor foundry was a pioneer in
    named (branded) styles, associated with its hiring of celebrity designers/typographers
    to design typefaces.\r\n\r\nClarendon was the first bold type to be stylistically
    related to the normal/regular, c.1850, although the concept of type family did
    not then exist. I have theorized that Clarendon was prompted by the introduction
    of smooth coated paper which made press gain very noticeable. No doubt the introduction
    of Light occurred at the same time.\r\n"

    with different weights. There is not much in the way of type families before 1896ca
    when fonts like Cheltenham by Morris Fuller Benton and Bertram G. Goodhue were
    introduced. There were a substantial number of fonts called \"lightface\" in the
    latter part of the 19th century, but they were not closely matched with heavier
    weights of the same design. \r\nI agree with your suggestion of the influence
    of coated paper.\r\nOther technological innovation's also made possible the use
    of lighter fonts. For example electrotyping for font copying and production. \r\nDon\r\n"

    The heavy \"fatface\" fonts of the early 19th century looked crude and clumsy

    printing which included light line fonts and ornaments was a way for letterpress

    is a fascinating piece of information. It makes sense because AG is the blueprint
    for Helvetica</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAccording to extensive research by Schumacher
    Gebler (published in Schriftgestalten by Tino Gra\xDF, Niggli 2008), Akzidenz
    Grotesk may not be looked upon as the one and only predecessor of Helvetica. He
    mentions and shows Franz\xF6sische Grotesk by Haas, which is the Haas\u2019sche
    version of breite halbfette Grotesk by Schelter & Giesecke (with minor changes
    and a single-storey g).\r\n\r\nFournier said:\r\n<blockquote>and Univers which
    offer many thin weights.</blockquote>\r\nUnivers rather roots in the alphabets
    made by Walter K\xE4ch, Frutigers teacher than in Akzidenz Grotesk. K\xE4chs work
    is likely to be influenced by Akzidenz Grotesk, but the rational approach, the
    clean counters and the consequent horizontally cutting-off the stroke ends of
    a, c, e g and s in all weights and widths of a sans serif typeface can be found
    in the work of K\xE4ch. K\xE4chs alphabets have been published, but for those
    who do not want to collect antique type books: some of it can be found in the
    book s on and by Frutiger, mainly in the publication by Heidrun Osterer.\r\n\r\nMaxim
    said:\r\n<blockquote>Royal-Grotesk was allegedly developed \u201Cfor use in the
    scholarly publications of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin\u201D.
    That does not sound too credible to me.</blockquote>\r\nExactly, although Theinhard
    made a lot of typefaces for the Royal Prussian Academy, he does not credit himself
    doing Royal Grotesk, let alone for the Academy, in his memoires as published in
    1899. It would be interesting to see Royal Grotesk in one of the publications
    of the Royal Prussian Academy though.\r\n\r\nBerthold has been mentioning the
    \ Royal Grotesk from the Theinhardt foundry as the source of Akzidenz Grotesk
    mager since 1955 at least. Papers in the Berthold Type Specimen Library, now in
    the Technik Museum in Berlin, confirm this. So the idea of Royal Grotesk being
    the predecessor of Akzidenz Grotesk must be reduced to the light weight. The other
    weights are likely to have been based on typefaces from other foundries. \u2018Halbfette
    B\xFCcher Grotesk\u2019 from Bauer & Co, Stuttgart, 1896 is officially known to
    be the predecessor of Akzidenz Grotesk bold condensed from 1955. Where the other
    weights come from, I wouldn\u2019t know, but according to Wolfgang Homola\u2019s
    [[http://www.typefacedesign.org/resources/dissertation/2004/WolfgangHomola_dissertation.pdf|Type
    Design in the age of the machine]], it is likely that the \u2018Breite Grotesk\u2019
    by J. G. Schelter & Giesecke could have been an inspirational source in this case.
    From this publication one can also read that in those days, the German use of
    mager rather refers to what we now would call regular than light. Also breit often
    seems to refer to regular width rather than wide. Maybe this has to do with the
    fact that many of the Textura and Fraktur faces were rather condensed and heavy.\r\n\r\n"

    for \"fine\" meaning thin or light print, I find your gallery of thin types to
    be a good survey of what happens to different type categories -- not just the
    sans -- when they go on an extreme diet. They loose much of their distinctiveness
    and all of them end up looking more or less like an emaciated typewriter font.
    I can see some use for such types at large scale for headings or short text on
    smooth quality paper, e.g. a Vanity Fair full page advert. \r\nThe samples posted
