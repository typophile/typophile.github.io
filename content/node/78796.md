  body: 'I don''t know what''s specific to InDesign, but generally I think the solution
    is to give the paragraph style a negative indent, and your paragraphs would go:
    tagline, Tab, rest of paragraph.'

  body: What the others have said. Note that you will need to give the paragraph a
    left margin and a negative indent to the first line. Then match the value of tab
    to the one of the left margin.

    it, unfortunately, does meet my case. I want tagline and paragraph to be independent
    (maybe two text frames?) for some reason, line-height for example.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/variable-paragraph-2_3494.png]"

  body: "If there are two text frames, there isn\u2019t a way that the headline in
    one could flow with the text in the other, unless you use a table instead of two
    text frames.\r\nBut you can manually keep headline and text aligned using the
    \"Align first line only\" option in the Paragraph settings."

  body: "You could put the tag lines into anchored objects if you don't mind placing
    the text by hand. (I don't know of any way to have text flow into anchored objects\u2014but
    I could be wrong.)"

  body: "Why don't you want to use tables? They would work fine.\r\n\r\nIf you're
    not using tables, and IF the tag lines fit on one line, a simple method is just
    type the tag line, tab over to the paragraph, and then insert an invisible \"indent
    to here\" character (Command-Backslash) at the start of the paragraph. That will
    cause subsequent lines of the paragraph  to automatically left-align with the
    first one. But if your tag lines are more than one line deep, this method won't
    work.\r\n"

    I wanted to know, whether there is some other way.

  body: "A table structure is best. As I remember, you can set a table up as a master
    page, and just flow in the text, if it has tabs placed.\r\n\r\nI did 50-60 pages
    this way, for a book having simultaneous Nahutl and English, where stanzas had
    to align on facing pages, as did new pages, and a series of numbers.\r\nThe on-line
    edition is not what I designed and set, but shows the idea.\r\n\r\nhttp://utdi.org/book/index.php?page=songs.php&pagenumber=3\r\n\r\nThe
    on-line edition has links to the notes, but I had to set them as footnotes, recto
    (English) only, which made paging the whole thing more difficult than the on-line
    edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There is another way.\r\nCreate a text box for the body text and another
    for a tagline, then copy and paste the taglines text box inside the the body text
    text box.\r\nThese are called anchored objects.\r\nGo to Object-> Anchored Objects
    -> Options and Customise the position to suit.\r\nSaving these settings as an
    object style means that they can be applied to all taglines.\r\nThe increasing
    line length can be accomplished by adding in a right side indent.\r\nThese can
    be saved a paragraph styles and applied to subsequent paragraphs\r\n\r\nDrop me
    an email if you need more help, I know this may not be clear."
