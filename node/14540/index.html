  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've just signed up for a class on [[letterpress]] printing, using a Vandercook press (not sure if it's a Universal or an SP, etc.). It's taught by a more fine-arts oriented instructor, so I get the feeling there will be more loose exploration and technical craft and less  typographic stricture. So, I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for a first-timer on a letterpress: what to try, what do you enjoy most about using it, how do you design for the letterpress, your experiences, anything. I'm hoping to really dig in and get my hands dirty (in the figurative and literal senses) when the time comes.

Thanks!</div>

Just enjoy it Chris.  Don't get the packing too tight or your crush your type.  You only need a kiss impression. Make sure the packing has been changed to get even impression.  We used to do kerning with a bandsaw on big type but there was plenty of it in those days. Don't forget to lock up your form and DON'T PUT YOUR FEET UP ON THE FURNITURE :-)

		<div class="commentbody">From my experience, woodtype is spaced much more poorly 'out of the box' than metal -- so there are plenty of opportunities to play with reglets and tweak the little things. If that's what you're into.

If you're going the metal type route, try to leaf through a copy of Geoffrey Dowding's <em>Finer Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type</em>. If the instructor is more of a fine arts bent, I'd doubt that they'll delve too deeply into that realm of spacing.

If they don't supply paper, make sure you get something decent to print on. I've had good luck in the past with Mohawk, Neenah, Cougar, and French. Past that, there's always the pricier fine art papers (Arches, BFK, Stonehenge, etc.).

And as Chris says, be sure you're not packed too tight (esp. if you're using cover weight stock).

And, of course, have a ball.</div>

Indeed. But the "more fine-arts oriented instructor" is something that raises a red flag for me in this respect: murderous impression depth is sadly considered more artsy.

Paper: I've used BFK for "presentation" pieces, but if you're interested in getting honest, super sharp black-on-white printing (as I generally am) you know what works amazingly well? Inkjet paper! And it's cheaper. I've had the best luck with Epson's "Matte Paper Heavyweight".

Yeah, the fine-arts aspect makes me a little wary. But at the same time, it'll break me out of my very conventions-oriented mindest a little and I won't judge until I'm doing it. I'm looking for a nice balance: nice meaty, deep impressions of funky forms and big type, along with some well set, well printed text. We'll see. This is also a way for me to argue getting a Kelsey,(or the like) some time in the future. Damned if we have the space, but that's not really the point, is it?

Hrant, it makes sense that Epson's heavyweight matte is good for printing. On my 880i inkjet, the blacks are so rich and lush they're velvety.</div>

Lead and antimony are not deadly, you'd need to turn the lead into a vapor for it to be so. But washing your hands is a good idea since mice like to live in typecases.

		<div class="commentbody">So, I've been to 2 classes, and will be doing my first solo composition lockup tonight (I think). I got to set and print a line of metal type in the first class, which was slipped into a pre-fab lockup and printed. I really enjoyed it. I had no idea how...disorienting?...it would feel. I think of type as this flexible mesh, a fabric that can be stretched and pulled on the computer (no, I don't scale my type). The solid, immutable nature of the metal type (especially if you only have one size) is so foreign to me, but also kind of...reassuring? Knowing that x word in x font will be x picas wide and that's what you have to work with is simultaneously annoying and really nice. It creates solid design posts around which you need to slalom; it limits the variables. The downside is the kerning. I'm not sure how much (if any) adjustment I'm permitted to make (to letters like 'T', for example) to the University's type.

The teacher doesn't push typography on us, but is very open to my attention to it and has kind of tagged me as the 'expert' for letter spacing. I'm still trying to figure out where the character palette is to adjust the kerning on the Vandercook.  ;)

Anyway, I'm bringing my camera in and hopefully I can post some photos from the UArts shop. I don't have enough experience to say whether it's a good or an OK shop, but it's got a nice selection of faces (metal and wood) and seems well-organized.

Again, thanks for the tips. Hopefully, I'll be able to post my composition for critique in the next week or two.</div>

Every so often, my brain wigs out and I have to shake my head, but it's not as hard as I thought. Punctuation seems to be my weakness. I'm learning the value of a clean type surface. So much easier to read shiny type on a dark background than cruddy type.

It's interesting that older metal type is set, in a way, in reverse from its typical output (light on dark vs. dark on light).</div>

Untill someone has done a bad job of redistributing the type and you get a wrong font or a u for an n in you job case.

Wait until you drop your first galley.  This won't happen with one line. Waituntil you have spent numerous hours setting it and then try to transfer it to the press bed :-)

I did that once, and early on (and in the presence of a dozen people). And I had to buy the type as a result! What was most spooky about the experience was that for many seconds after it happened I was thinking "Damn, I have to start over"; but then the much worse reality, "Oh my god, I've damaged this wonderful type", gave me a body blow, and I alternated between chalk-white and fire-engine red for about an hour.
