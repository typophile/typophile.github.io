body: "The fastidiously authentic Garamond Premier departs from its model in one noticeable
  respect. For while the details, shapes, and proportions of individual letters are
  extremely faithful to the originals, their proportions relative to one another are
  not--especially with regards to x-height.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in Garamond's type
  the top of the bowl of the \"d\" is much lower than the top of the \"u\" or \"g\".
  The same feature is apparent in other old styles, such as Jenson's. \r\n\r\nRevivals
  of the early 20th century repeated this trait, e.g. ATF's, and some played it up--Goudy's
  Garamont, of course. Robert Slimbach's revival, while containing a similar degree
  of micro-detail and variability of detail (compared with, say, ITC Garamond) is
  much more uniform in x-height.\r\n\r\nThis feature of metal-era old style type design
  may relate to the imprecision of letterpress printing. For even in the best examples,
  there is an element of \"bounce\", in which the letters are not precisely aligned
  vertically. By varying the vertical dimensions of different x-height characters,
  bounce is camouflaged; at least, that's my theory.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, digital
  type, with its great precision of placement, coupled with the constraint of vertical
  alignment zones required by hinting procedures, favours a uniformity of x-height.\r\n\r\nThe
  situation raises a number of questions:\r\n<ol><li>To what extent is the varying
  x-height of the original old style types an integral part of the design?</li>\r\n<li>Does
  it have any reading benefits?</li>\r\n<li>Was it done for the reading benefits,
  to camouflage bounce, for some other reason, or a combination of reasons?</li>\r\n<li>When
  a revival emulates certain qualities of a previous technology -- as almost all do,
  where does the redesigner draw the line?</li>\r\n<li>Would there be any merit in
  taking things a step further and using Contextual Alternates to simulate a degree
  of bounce, and at the same time incorporate significant irregularity of characters'
  vertical dimensions?</ol>"

  body: "Wow. Nick, it is thrilling that you have brought this up, as it has been
    very much on my mind the past few months concerning something having to do with
    linotype (metal) composition, but closely related to what you describe above.
    Within the past few weeks I have spoken about this both with Miss Tiffany and
    with Matthew Carter. Interestingly enough, in his reply Matthew <em>also</em>
    suggested using Contextual Alternates. I was referring to this as \"baseline jump\"
    rather than bounce, but I think the effect for the reader is very much the same
    as what you are saying about the type from the Old Gang. Here's an extract of
    what I sent to Matthew:\r\n\r\n\"[While doing research for the Dwiggins biography
    I'm writing] I've been reading a lot of the Knopf and LEC books that Dwiggins
    designed, reading them all the way through, and of course many of those are set
    in Caledonia, Electra, and a couple in other types. In most of these, the compositon
    is extremely welcoming and easy to read. In addition to the differences in warmth
    compared to digital versions, the other thing I keep noticing is that the mats
    fall down into the line in faintly-different vertical positions before they get
    sent over for casting. The more worn the mats, the more likely this is to happen.
    The result is a tiny discrepancy in baseline alignment from letter to letter,
    which to my eye adds variety and warmth as the line progresses. I'm wondering
    if there is some way I can do this (and I am talking tiny tiny variations here)
    in making an alphabet that mimics this behavior of real linotype composition.
    After reading so many of these books over the past year, I have really become
    convinced that this subtle drift is actually an *asset* of linotype composition,
    and by its more precise nature, the inexorable perfection of digital type makes
    it too perfect, too relentless.\""

  body: "And in answer to your particular questions.\r\n\r\n1. [To what extent is
    the varying x-height of the original old style types an integral part of the design?]
    It seems to me that the Old Gang very consciously made each size just right for
    its optical presence on the sheet (I'm thinking of the dramatic differences in
    Janson from 10- to 12-pt, for example). Maybe they were so astonishingly good
    at what they did, using nothing but simple hand tools (and did they even have
    crude magnifiers in the 1400s?), that the slight differences in size from character
    to character <em>were</em> just as intentional.\r\n\r\n2. [Does it have any reading
    benefits?] Based on my experience with perhaps 30 books in the past few months,
    I say absolutely yes! Hence my musings in the quoted text of my previous post.
    These were set in linotype, but I think the effect is very similar.\r\n\r\n3.
    [Done for reading benefits, camouflage bounce, other, combination?] Can't comment
    on their intentions. Results very compelling, however.\r\n\r\n4. [When a revival
    emulates. . . where . . . draw the line?]\r\nYowza. Here's the crux of it all.
    I just made another comment over on the \"setting poetry in Electra\" thread because
    I think many digital versions of classic types are too emaciated looking. If you
    look there you'll see a sample of digital and metal Electra (12-pt) side by side.
    I would welcome the \"imitation\" of ink squeeze in digitally-composed and offset-printed
    books in these faces as I think it would improve their readability. \r\n\r\nAs
    a book designer rather than a type designer, for me it is all about the content
    of the text, how readable it is, and how much the type helps to convey the spirit
    of what the author is saying, far more than the fetching upswing of a particular
    glyph. <em>Apart from foundry specimen pages, these letters never exist outside
    the context of each other!</em> \r\n\r\nTherefore, the more readable and accessible
    we can make these \"revivals\" in the range of 10- to 12-point, the better. And
    in the case of treasured favorites of mine like digital Bembo, Electra, and Caledonia,
    the digitals have never begun to approach the warmth and readability of the metal.
    Therefore I have used them a lot in metal but rarely in digital. Is it too simplistic
    of me to think that this warmth could be easily attained?\r\n\r\n5. [Would there
    be any merit in . . .  Contextual Alternates?] I don't understand the implementation
    of the technology, but it certainly seems appealing to me."

  body: "Nick, as you know, I talked about this in my talk at TypeCon 2006 on my Caslon
    revival in progress.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, in my experimentation I found
    that variation at the x-height can be good if there is systematic reason for it.
    For example both Adobe Garamond (I don't have Premier yet) and my Caslon--and
    the original Caslon, though not with full consistency--have the stems at x height
    ( of nmr etc) going higher than the overshoot height of the o. \r\n\r\nAlso the
    cross bar of the t and f can be lower than the top of the x. \r\n\r\nIf there
    is some visual reason in the design why the d overshoot should be less than the
    o and b, sure go for it. But that kind of stuff didn't work for me. (Italics are
    another story.)\r\n\r\nSuch variation can look junky, and less readable, which
    is what I found when I tried more variation, without a strict visual logic to
    it. \r\n\r\nFor example, Bruce, I do not think that the jumpy baseline of the
    worn Linotype machines is responsible for the warmth of some of the metal types.
    After experimenting with it, I became convinced that it is a false trail. Of course
    that is just one person's opinion, but I have actually tried it, though not extensively.
    \   \r\n\r\n>where does the redesigner draw the line?\r\n\r\nThere is no general
    answer to that question. What to adopt and what to change is a creative decision
    that depends on the designer's goals, analysis of the problem, and aesthetic and
    craft sense. That's why superb revivals like Slimbach's Garamonds and Jenson are
    not so common. "

    missed most of it due to SOTA duties, so either that or poor memory.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    have actually tried it</em>\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about doing that for a while
    -- varying several kinds of letterpress artefact with contextual alternates --
    and will maybe get round to it in a few years time, given the present backlog.\r\n\r\nBruce,
    the way contextual alternates would do that is by the page layout application
    choosing from a number of alternate versions of the same character, each time
    the text calls for that character. While there is no true \"random\" function
    in, say, InDesign, for doing that, there are ways of simulating the effect by
    coding in the font. Adam Twardoch and Tal Leming have done OT randomization. And
    of course the classic Beowulf by LettError, with custom coding."

  body: ">unfortunately missed most of it \r\n\r\nOh, Ok. Yes, it was in the slides
    as well as the talk. Because of the huge variation in all aspects of the original
    Caslon, as well as Linotype's 1923 Caslon--my other main inspiration--the issue
    of x-height variation is has been one of the issues I have focused on. There are
    three or four other key issues, as well as of course the thousands of decisions
    in actually drawing the glyphs. \r\n\r\nAs one of my inspirations has been the
    Lino version I specifically looked at the issue of baseline bounce. I had raised
    it here some years ago on typophile in discussion with Kent Lew. But I have not
    tested it extensively, or try to build it in systematically, as you are thinking
    of trying out. I just tried it on a few characters, and it looked worse to me
    as far as readability, so I abandoned that path as a false trail, and explored
    other ways of getting the warmth of metal Caslon. \r\n\r\nPs. Because Garamond
    was so brilliant and also (unlike Caslon) precise, I think the presumption should
    be that he had a reason for making the d's arch lower, if that is indeed the case.
    (You have to look out for damaged type etc.) I would guess that if one can't figure
    out the reason for such variation, then it probably isn't a good idea to encorporate
    it in a typeface. And if one can figure out the reason, it may still be a bad
    idea. Even the greats mess up now and then.  "

    of salt (of course) but I think that small variations in type do add up to a richer
    more compelling page if they are within the a sweet spot or range of movement

    within that range - up to a point. But looking at <a href=http://www.talleming.com/pages/work/programming/openType/edInterlock/index.html>
    Tal Leming's work with Ed interlock </a> ( check it out! ) suggest again to me
    that deliberate combinations will be better still. \r\n\r\nIt would be a hell
    of a lot of work to do for a Garamond ( or Caslon ) revival. And the consideration
    of the variations would be far more subtle to consider than the ones available
    in ed interlock but I think the principle is the same - deliberate creation of
    well observed variation is a good idea for text faces. \r\n\r\nIn some ways this
    is of course just a reiteration of the claim/speculation I have been making related
    to Notan and idea that special variation made by creating letter combination specific
    alteration of some forms and special fitting for pairs and tripples in typographic
    text faces is the ideal.  I don't see why some degree of bounce aught to be excluded
    from the set of options within that variation!\r\n\r\nTal's scripts actually go

    uniformity.\r\n\r\nWhat font has a p bowl raised off the baseline? I don't know
