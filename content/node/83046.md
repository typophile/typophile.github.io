body: Are there any readily available fonts that have an upper-case letter R with
  single dot above, and an upper-case letter R with a double dot (or diaeresis) above?
  These symbols are used in a technical discussion of radar; I think they pertain
  to range-rate.

    makes no sense as it is since the italic correction is a fixed value for each
    character regardless of what is next to it (though it get only applied when switching
    from italic to upright). I just checked rule 12 in Appendix G of The TeXbook and
    it states:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<strong>rule 12</strong>. If the current item
    is an Acc atom ... If the nucleus is not a single character, let $s=0$; otherwise
    set $s$ to the kern amount for the nucleus followed by the <code>\\skewchar</code>
    of its font.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf you checked the kerning on the top of

    R 0.055557)\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nthe character with octal code 177 is the skewchar.
    In MS implementation a dedicated field is used instead of (mis)using kerning (I

  body: Hrant, it isn't a question of making the accent-like mathematical operator
    look either attached or detached from whatever is below them, but of the specific
    conventions of alignment of operators and operands in mathematical typesetting.
    In mathematical typesetting, one is frequently dealing with both horizontal and
    vertical layout, and generally speaking what is true of alignment of larger, more
    complex expressions is true of alignment of smaller combinations within them.
    Hence, the centre alignment of the accent-like operators to top of whatever is
    below them is the same as the alignment of the top part of an expression to the
    lower part. This means, among other things, that the distance between the accent-like
    operator and what is below does not affect the horizontal offset above an italic
    form. So, for instance, looking at Michel's italic H example, you can see that
    if the accent were raised or is something else were placed above it, this would
    be a straight vertical shift or alignment, not a slanted move or offset.

  body: "<cite>Am I missing something?</cite>\r\n\r\nNot really. Accent positioning
    is refined in a similar manner to GPOS accent positioning. Accents each have a
    center position defined via 'Top Accent Attachment'(optically centered in most
    cases) and each base can also have a center position defined; these two positions
    are aligned on the <em>x</em>-axis, and are displayed. If a base glyph does not
    have an entry, then accents are simply centered. For those who don't know, accents
    can also be mapped to alternates via the [flac] feature ('flattened' accents,
    analogous to cap-variants of accents) and also to horizontal, or wide variants
    for placement over wider glyphs (the Math handler measures the base glyph and
    then uses the most appropriate accent variant). Note that the Top Accent Attachment
    is really only an <em>x</em>-axis value, unlike a GPOS anchor, which has both
    <em>x</em>- and <em>y</em>-coordinates. <em>y</em>-positioning is dynamically
    achieved by measuring the base glyph as well as other elements (eg. stacked accents),
    whether you're in a display mode or not etc.\r\n\r\nAs to fonts that support what
    Gus wants, he's probably already figured that out, which if you are using (Windows)
    Word 2007/2010 would be Cambria Math (Word defaults to this when you enter a Math
    zone) or Maxwell Math, when its released. For outside a Math zone, one would need
    a font with fairly robust GPOS accent positioning, such as Times or Arial or...?"
