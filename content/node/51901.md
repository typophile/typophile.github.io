  reminds me a bit of William Thorowgood's \"Six-Line Reversed Egyptian Italic\" that
  Nicolete Gray reproduced in <cite>Nineteeth Century Ornamented Typefaces</cite>,
  but with a modern twist.\r\n\r\nIs that a <strong>Th</strong> ligature?\r\n\r\nI'd
  be interested to see some of the other characters."
