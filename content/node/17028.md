  older :-)\r\n\r\nI was thinking he didn't say anything about it because he was afraid
  we would give him <a href=\"http://www.halloweencostumes4u.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?store_code=hal&screen=PROD&product_code=rub50680\">something
  like this for this</a>\r\n for his birthday :-)\r\n\r\n"

    birthday might go unnoticed because I have the priviledge to share it with a certain
    (much more talented) designer from Malakoff.\r\n\r\nChris, your wig isn't that
    far off. Here is the biggest hair-photo I've got:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dan_big_hair.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    this is more-or-less what I look like now:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dan
