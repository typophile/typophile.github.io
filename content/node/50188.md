  just an IT briefing but somehow it seems symbolic to everyone. I get my bike back
  from the shop tomorrow.  I think I'll bike over to Waitrose and get some lovely

    is very limited blogging going on so far. I am have something in process but it
    will be a little while before I shows up. I will ask the other students to send
    me their links & create a compendium 'o links. Dan - you set quite a high bar
    for us to meet! \r\n\r\nDespite it's being quite early, I am very happy with the
    way things are going already. \r\n\r\nI still haven't been to Waitrose. It farther
    off than I thought! Maybe today though..."
