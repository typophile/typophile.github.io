<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi All,
This is probably going to be the most generic question ever, but I'm looking for a typeface for a rebrand of a store I'm going to be working on. The current identity is very similar to ITC's Edwardian Script (ugh!), and the company doesn't want to move too far away from it. I've always been a bit cautious towards scripts, I rarely use them because I've always felt that they're usually far too fiddly for identity work, have a tendency to fill in and aren't particularly easy to read, as well as being old-fashioned for my purposes. Can anyone suggest contemporary, script faces that are elegant but are thicker than Edwardian Script? I'm also open to suggestions of italicised serif display faces that look modern.
I know it's all a bit woolly and I've not narrowed things down, but I'm hoping I might discover some fantastic new faces and/or foundries that can get me going in the right direction.
Cheers
Si</div>

<div class=commentbody>I did a search a couple of weeks ago for a customer, who wanted a cople of logos with a script font.
Some of these were tried (but not chosen, actually)
http://www.myfonts.com/FontAlbums/AlbumDetail?aid=175220
This was used for one
http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/tartine-script/
Hope they're of some use.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Reading your post, <a href=http://emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PDalSc.html>Dalliance Script</a> comes to mind. Also from Emigre: <a href=http://emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PMatSR.html>Matrix Script</a>
or something a bit more traditional <a href=http://p22.com/ihof/zaner4.html>Zaner</a>, but that may be a bit over the top for logo work.
Let us know if any of our suggestions are in the right vein.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mark is write-on with Zaner. Definitely take a look at it!!!
It has a unique appeal which will separate it from typical scripts and lend itself to branding.

<div class=commentbody>Wow! Thanks for the response, everyone!
Thanks Paul for suggesting I let you guys know what's hitting the mark - it's pretty rude of me otherwise...
I've just had chance to have a good look at the foundries...
www.sudtipos.com seems to be hitting the mark, they look pretty modern and have heaps of personality. I'm a fan of Affair Script, Brisa, Suave Script, I'll have to develop my ideas more and make my choices. At the moment, I'm just doing the groundwork - unfortunately I can't post how I'm getting on on the critique board, am not allowed to :(
Cheers again for all your contributions,
Si</div>

<div class=commentbody>I must say - I really like your work Paul - I like Zaner, but I think it's too fine for my needs (and a bit too classical); also I'm a really big fan of Allyson, I saw it on P22 and it's amazing! If not on this project, I'd really like to use them in the future!

<div class=commentbody>Doesn't it matter what the store's image is and what it sells, even if confidentiality requires that to be expressed at a certain level of generality?
Do people really feel comfortable about suggesting typefaces without knowing anything about the history of a business, its current products and its intended customers?
For example, yesterday somebody asked for advice on type for model/toy railroad accessories, and someone named Mark Simonson made what seemed to me to be some pretty important points about how history and the product and the geographic location of the customer might have a bearing on choice of type. To me, what he had to say made a lot of sense, applicable to any enterprise.
Just curious. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Redge, you’re absolutely right. But in this case, I think, Simon just wanted some new foundries and lot of alternatives, so he could make the decision himself. And he already narrowed the field quite a bit.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry Redge, you're right, but Grot Esqué (I wish I'd thought of that name!) answered for me. The store is old, with very fragmented, inconsistent branding (that seems to have been amended by different signwriters on the few different branches of the store). As for what it sells, the store is quite upmarket and sells a very diverse range of homewares. The store has heritage but needs to be brought up-to-date considerably.
I'm going to be presenting multiple approaches, so I'm keeping my options open. Really I was using the thread to discover new foundries/faces - If I don't use them for one option, I can always bring them into play elsewhere. I tend to work on identities frequently, so I like to keep on top of what's out there.
