    rules regarding Chinese business cards. I think they relate mainly to the handling
    of them rather than their design, but just the same you might want to research
    that. \r\n\r\nAlso there are some companies that specialize in translating & printing
    bilingual cards (japanprint.com is one I found via Google); you might find examples
    posted at their websites."
