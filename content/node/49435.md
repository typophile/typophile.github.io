body: "Hello, I'm trying to find out if this logo uses any existing font? It is a
  french manufacturer of mobile homes. Obviously the 'o' character couldn't be part
  of the font; that is a sub-logo of theirs. But the rest, is it anything you recognize?
  I've tried the WTF checker and and some questions-based guides, but no luck. The
  image is from their website, http://www.pilote.fr . They have been around for quite
  some time, so I doubt it is a recent font.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any hints.\r\nMartin

  body: Excellent! Thanks for all your help. I'll deal with the custom logo myself,
    but I really wanted the font for some other text I'll be creating. And now I know
    what I need thanks to you, robbiefa.
