  body: "First, this is essentially <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/melior/?refby=typographica\">Melior</a>.\r\n\r\nThere
    aren't a lot of alternatives to Melior (other than Zapf's other <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/marconi_virtual/\">even
    more dated designs</a>), which is surprising considering the recent popularity
    of square sans serifs. Type makers, get on it!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/republic/?refby=typographica\">RePublic</a>
    is really the only thing I can recall that comes close."

    is also square and underused.

  body: It's a bit of a stretch, but I really love <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_danubia/">FF
    Danubia</a> as a contemporary take on vertically stressed serifs of all kinds.

  body: Maybe <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/paratype/itc_charter_ot/">Charter</a>,
    which isn't so new, but still manages to appear very fresh.

    has similar forms, but a much smaller x-height and fancier italics.'

  body: Not necessarily more contemporary, but <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1431.html">Kepler</a>
    and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1415.html">Utopia</a> sure
    are alternatives.

    Bureau Fonts | Miller\">Miller</a> from Font Bureau. It's not as square as your
    example, but it's nice and wide.\r\n\r\nFB's <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/serif/Proforma\"
    title=\"Font Bureau Fonts | Proforma\">Proforma</a> may also fit the bill."
