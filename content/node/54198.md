  now but have been considering finding a job with a design company to get a more
  steady source of income. I'm also a student so I'd be looking for something part
  time. Is it possible to find a part time design job? Where should I look? I've tried
  craigslist but haven't had too much luck. Also, I'm sure it varies from region to
  region, but how much can I expect to make at my experience level?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'd see if your school has any jobs - my university was wonderful in providing
    many opportunities for students to find \"school friendly\" employment. Perhaps
    your school has similar opportunities? That's where I'd first look.\r\n\r\nYou
    might also see if design studios in your area offer internships. This is a great
    way to gain experience, build a portfolio, build relationships, and be able to
    work part-time (although that really depends on the studio). You'll probably not
    make a lot as far as money goes, but it's usually a great learning experience.
    Your school may have services to help you find internships.\r\n\r\nAs far as pay
    goes, it all really depends on your portfolio, experience, and focus with a bit
    of geography and a touch of local economic climate interleaved into the mix. In
    other words, you'll have to figure that out based on the above variables. You
    may want to check AIGA (http://www.aiga.org/) for additional resources on figuring
    that out.\r\n\r\nFinally - good luck and happy job hunting!\r\n\r\n"
