  you in advance!\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

    video for Justice by DVNO</a> makes a lot of \u201Ccool\u201D 80\u2019s TV logo

  body: "Long association, different media.\r\n\r\nOriginally, type on (black-and-white)
    TV tended to be hot-press, using a white imaging film on black posterboard for
    use as luminance-keyed \"supers\"; alternately, text would also be simply painted
    on posterboard for on-screen graphics. Hot-press type tended to be larger sizes
    of available foundry type.\r\n\r\nComputer-generated type for TV made its debut
    in the late 1970s...\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chyron_Corporation\r\n\r\nThe
    first instance of \"branded\" type usage I can recall was NBC's choice to go with
    Serpentine Bold Italic for on-air use in the early 1980s. In the early 90s, computer-generated
    graphics for TV moved away from row-dependent bitmap fonts, thus allowing a wider
    range of type to be used in the production process."
