    Hopefully I&#39;ll be up again sometime. I actually didn&#39;t know you were back
    in Vancouver until Jim told me, or I&#39;d&#39;ve emailed you. <BR> <BR>Incidentally,
    how&#39;s the Deepdene bold? I seriously can&#39;t believe how fast Jim is.'

  body: Jim, <BR> <BR>I have been in Sooke with Ross. I don&#39;t know if you met
    him. He used to build boats. Now he just builds. Also he is an Easthope buff.
    But I might go up and see Ian on Gabriola. I am looking for some space to work
    on a boat. <BR> <BR>

    <BR>Contrary to impressions, I very much enjoy fondling machinery. I used to build

  body: Oh yeah. One more thing about the workshop. I got to use Ikarus for the first
    time to digitize the drawing I brought. I can definitely see why folks would prefer
    it to drawing in FOG and FLAB. Or working in Illustrator or Freehand. I suppose
    you end up with more points than are necessary, but it gives you a working outline
    in a matter of seconds. Pretty amazing.
