body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>Sometimes when I&#39;m designing I want to preview a font
  just to see if I like it. I have a lot of stuff offline, but don&#39;t want to go
  the whole time online to preview it. I also don&#39;t want to install it in FontAgent
  and remove it after 2 seconds when I see it&#39;s not the font I was looking for.
  <BR>Before I used FontGander to preview my fonts and that worked perfect for me.
  But now that we are on OSX I can&#39;t seem to find a &#40;preferably&#41; freeware
  program that allows me to see a font before I install it. That&#39;s too much of
  a hassle and could mess up my allready installed fonts. <BR> <BR>Is there someone
  that knows a good program that meets my expectations? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>

  body: If you double-click on a font file in OS X you will get a simple  <BR>preview
    in Font Book. That&#39;s about all the app&#39;s good for - but <BR>it works for
    a quick sample.

  body: One of the things I liked about FontGander was that it  allowed you to see
    &#42;all&#42; the characters &#40;and also find out key combinations easily&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Will anything do that in OS X?

    as for all chars and stuff, have you used the character palette?

  body: I looked around a bit more and found &#39;Font Showcase&#39;. I&#39;m testing
    it right now and must say that I kinda like it. It workes much like FontGander.
    It will allow you to load an external folder which contains fonts. Or you can
    just load one single font.  <BR>It allows you to use your own text string to see
    the characters. This is good, because mostly I need the font for a specific logo
    or name. You can change this into any text you want.  <BR>If you want to see the
    whole character set, use the &#39;Character View&#39; option, which surprisingly
    brings up an extra window. Here you can see all the glyph boxes with it&#39;s
    number and keyboard combination. This only works with installed font though. An
    external font will not be previewed. And that&#39;s just what I wanted.  <BR>
    <BR>All toghether it workes fine for now, but Ithink I&#39;ll find something better.
    I&#39;ll have a serious look at the other suggestions and let you know. <BR> <BR>Thanks,
    <BR>

  body: If you have a media management app like <a href="http://www.iview-multimedia.com/"
    target="_blank">iView Media Pro</a> you can just drag your font folders onto its
    icon and it will show you a customizable preview of every font in that folder.
    Same as it does with images. <BR> <BR>Maybe iPhoto does this too?
