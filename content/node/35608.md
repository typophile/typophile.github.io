  10 years, which makes me really old :( Anyway, I have set up my own web design studio
  after working for the past few years as a freelancer, I need some business cards,
  usually, I would turn to a graphic designer to do these for me, since I have next
  to no print experience, problem is, I have a limited budget so I am left to do them
  myself. \r\n\r\nI have a good understanding of grid systems, white space etc. even
  typography to a certain degree, the problem I have at the minute is deciding on
  a serif font to use for my cards, one that will compliment my logo (which is set
  in the rather conservative helvetica).\r\n\r\nMy website, which is not finished
  at the minute, uses Georgia effectively (I think anyway), here is a holding page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.blend.uk.com/\r\n\r\nSo
  what I am looking for is recommendations for a nice serif font to use in print.\r\n\r\nI
  have attached a first draft business card design (front) that uses Garamond, I quite
  like the font actually, but not sure how it will hold when I come to do the reverse
  of the card, solely in Garamond.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any help, guidance, tips etc.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLee "

    work in both mediums.\r\n\r\nAnd congrats on using brown well...that's never an
    easy task.\r\n\r\n"

    color. Not having the multiple process screens will help hold the type.\r\n\r\nYou
    can also add a trap weight stroke to the type, like .018 pt for example, and give
    the ink a little room to encroach."

  body: 'On the back of the card the type is reversed out of the brown too? If you
    like Garamond, Adobe Garamond is a little heavier than many cuts and would hold
    up better. Is your card stock going to be uncoated, coated both sides, or coated
    on the front only? You''ll get more ink bleeding into the text on uncoated and
    you''ll want even the finest strokes of the text to be sturdy enough.  '

  body: "Hi Gary, \r\n\r\nThanks for the help, I have used Garamond for the front
    and Adobe Garamond for the back. This is probably something I shouldn't do since
    they are two different fonts (although very similar). I do prefer the original
    Garamond at large sizes, i.e. for the main heading on the front, the lowercase
    g for me was a little more curvy if that makes sense...\r\n\r\nThe options I have
    for the card is:\r\n\r\nLaminated\r\nUn-Laminated\r\nLuxury Matt Lamination\r\n\r\n...and
    its 400gsm both sides with the same finish both sides.\r\n\r\nThe finish I envisaged
    originally, which I don't think I will be able to get with the options I have,
    is a rough finish, or as close as possible... nothing shiny, recycled almost.\r\n\r\nLooking
    at my old Pantone Swatch book, I'd say the solid uncoated would be best, but again,
    not sure for the price if I will have much of an say.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLee"

  body: "I have the front paragraph and all of the back set in Adobe Garamond Pro
    now, with the comments on adding a trap weight stroke, would a good alternative
    be to use the semi bold weight instead, I know I wasn't using this type before
    but the semi bold seems to add just enough on the front.\r\n\r\nAlso, would you
    recommend the same approach for the back, replacing all text with semi bold, and
    I suppose upping the semi bold already used to bold. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLee"

  body: "I'd bet on the semi-bold.\r\n\r\nWith this sort of printing you want to eliminate
    any chance for the printer to goof. You might inquire about the line screen. 175
    or above has a much better chance of keeping the skinny bits from closing up.
    Also, when choosing the color, fewer plates is better. So if your CMYK mix has
    less than 5% of any color you might consider reworking the mix to eliminate a
    color.\r\n\r\nAsk about minimum coverage percentages. The light screens could
    be an issue for the printer."

    back too, I have upped it a point.

  body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nThanks for comments, I have actually been working on this for
    a few hours and now have a back to the card and an additional front to consider.
    For the additional front, I have added some text to explain what I do and tried
    (I emphasize the word tried) to give it a nice typographic edge. I am probably
    not nearly experienced enough to pull this off, maybe some people can help me
    out. \r\n\r\n\r\njupiterboy: when you mention not having multiple process screens,
    would that be in relation to printing companies who offer full cmyk colour prints,
    because of my budget, I and time restraint, looks like I am going to have to use
    such a company.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLee"

  body: "One thing to keep in mind when designing a two-sided business card is that
    only one side will be visible at once.\r\n\r\nWhen you hand it to the person,
    it is easy to turn it over to see the other side, but remember that many, many
    cards get placed in folders or rolodexes, and in these cases only the one side
    shows.\r\n\r\nYou want to make sure that at least one side includes all the important
    information that might make a customer call you, rather than the guy on the next
    card."

    the colors - having the green as the background color, with brown type. If that's
    the direction you work in, you can stick with regular which is nicer than semi-bold.\r\n\r\nPeople
    still use rolodexes?"
