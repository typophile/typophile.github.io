  of expertise here - let me say thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nThis font is supposedly
  \"Kaiten ITC\" but I can't find any reference and the usual ID tools aren't helping.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do I have on my hands with this one?"

  body: "Wow, Kristen Normal it is for sure. Thanks very much.\r\n\r\nI bet I couldn't
    find it because it's been 'italicized' if that makes any sense? It looks like
    someone might have skewed the text in photoshop to make it lean forward. There
    doesn't appear to be any official italic version... most interesting."

  body: "More probably the 'Shear' function was used in Illustrator, which is a better
    application for playing around with lettering. It allows you to specify in degrees
    how much you would like to slant the lettering.\r\n\r\nIf you hang out here long
    you will see all kinds of graphic manipulation of type, with one of the most popular
    being one we like to call 'Squooshing'. I think it was Tiffany who coined that
    one.\r\n\r\nSometimes the graphic power of some software tools is irresistible,
    much to the detriment of the type being used, but often it's just in the eye of
    the beholder. (You can tell from this remark that I am not above graphic manipulation
    myself ;) )\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
