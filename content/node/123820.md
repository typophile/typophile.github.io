  I am undecided about which of the two fonts will work better in this project. What
  do you think?\r\n\r\n2) Could you help me out with the kerning? Specially in the
  very condensed version. The poster is A3 size and the current kerning 60 pt. \r\n\r\n3)
  On the other hand, i don't know if it is better to open the space between words
  (in the condesed font) a bit more or not.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for all your help
  and best,\r\nS\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the good tips Riccard ;-)\r\n\r\nI will reduce tracking then.
    I was kind of worry to reduce it since very condensed font tend not to read very
    well with tight tracking i think.\r\n\r\nThe condensed font is Knockout. The good
    thing it has many weights. Do you think of any alternative to Knockout type?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nS\r\n\r\n"

    from the skull in photoshop and then set the shadow portion to 'multiply'

    body: "Good tip Les ;-)\r\n\r\nYou are right, there was something in the shadows
      that was bothering me in the general design. I think if i set it to multiply
      it will change a lot. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the fonts? I am not sure
      about the condesed version now...\r\n\r\nCheers,"

  body: "Well I definitely prefer the condensed titling face. Maybe close up the ES,
    NT & ET slightly? Regarding some other typographic observations (and please take
    these with a grain of salt as I'm not familiar with Spanish typographic rules).\r\n\r\nI
    would raise the En dashes so the're closer to the midline of capitals.\r\n\r\nI
    would personally replace full spaces with thin spaces in Tel. No's.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure about the period after E-Mail ? (I understand it's a contraction but it's
    so endemic as too almost be a new & complete word in it's own right).\r\n\r\nMy
    2 cents   :)"

    body: "Hi Les,\r\n\r\nThanks for the very very useful tips! the poster look much
      better now. \r\n\r\nI have to learn more about the fine tuning art of kerning.
      It really does makes a difference. I have also reduced the space between words
      too. Do you know of a good book on kerning?\r\n\r\nHere is the final versions.
      I also tried one model without all caps. As Erick Spiekermann once said \"Don't
      Use All Caps\" hehe. The second one has a texture background too. What do you
      think? \r\n\r\nhttp://issuu.com/uzapuca/docs/__cartel_iom_-_mar_2015_-_imprenta__5af31c4cc1f07e\r\n\r\nThanks
      again for your kind help :)\r\n\r\n"

    for some unknown reason, ISSUU is not showing the mask with the multiply effect.
    Don't know why.\r\n\r\nBest ;)"

  body: "Just regarding the kerning, it's a bit uneven. For example, look at the tightness
    of ESE in the first line, as opposed to the looseness of PRET in the second line.\r\n\r\nAs
    for a book on kerning, I'm not so sure a book would help. Good kerning is mostly
    a matter of seeing, then making those adjustments and compromises necessary to
    achieve the best possible distribution and balance of positive and negative spaces.\r\n\r\nHave
    you seen the following online kerning game: http://type.method.ac. I don't always
    agree with some of the designer's solutions, but it's good practice.\r\n\r\nFor
    what it's worth, I like the poster."

  body: "I have to agree with Thylacine here, the kerning is still uneven. It's a
    difficult thing to advise on because doing one thing has a flow on affect for
    the rest of the 'word picture'. What you're trying to achieve is optically balanced
    white space around each letter whilst maintaining whole word cohesion (if that
    makes sense! I think it's more difficult to describe. than do)   :)\r\n\r\nTake
    D E S E O, I see it more as D ESE O. Kerning is not a science but IS all about
    the EYE (of which you appear to have a very good one, as this design as a whole
    attests)\r\n\r\nRegarding the skull's shadow, I'm not sure what program you're
    using so again it's difficult to advise, but I'm pretty sure you need to split
    the skull from it's shadow somehow, so you have 2 separate objects.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps"

    kerning again...it happens somethings when you are so fix in one work that you
    \"don't see anymore\".\r\n\r\nThe shadows is working right in the original PDF
    but ISSUU does make it flatten when it upload the file to its website.\r\n\r\nBest,"
