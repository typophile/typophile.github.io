body: You know those distorted abominations of letterforms you have to decipher when
  you register for sites? I'm surprised I couldn't find much interest for them within
  the typographic community. Has anyone entertained the thought of creating the CAPTCHA
  puzzle with found letterforms? I think it would be quite beautiful. A tag search
  for "oneletter" on flickr will reveal the amount of variety that could be used to
  fool the bots and still make it easy on the eye. I don't know much about the technical
  capabilities, but my guess is that with enough creativity in photography by a dedicated
  public, we can defeat technology. Then again, I should never underestimate those
  like Google.

  body: "I gave a talk at TypeCon 2007 about the work that I was involved in where
    we investigated how to make CAPTCHAs as easy to read as possible for humans and
    as difficult to read as possible for computer programs. It\u2019s a difficult
    challenge because the computer programs can be right less than 5% of the time
    to make money for the spammers, while we want people to able to recognize them
    close to 100% of the time. We\u2019ve written a few papers about our work:\r\n\r\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla_chi05.pdf\r\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla_hip05.pdf\r\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla_ceas05.pdf\r\n\r\nCheers,
