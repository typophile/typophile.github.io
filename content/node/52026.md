  to be deprived of this fine garment.\r\n\r\nDue to all the free merch offers through
  Veer, I have now acquired two, tag says men's size medium although it's a unisex
  garment. I will be posting one on ebay (U.S.) later today if anyone is interested.
  This is the original design, the navy with white type. I will be happy to ship outside
  of the U.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
