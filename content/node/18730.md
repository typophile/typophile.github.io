  body: "by the way, Chris, is that from a real t-shirt? and if yes, where can one
    get it?\r\n\r\noh, and is there a typeface available for that style? it looks
    like maybe it was just custom type for that logo, but it'd be sweet to have as
    a real font.\r\n\r\n\r\nanyway, that logo needs to be more square!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stiljers.png]"

    \ I scanned in my real Steelers T-shirt and did the fake job in PhotoShop.  The
    original Steeler type is a custom lettering piece. I am trying to figure out if
    the Steelers would be miffed if I made a few \"DeStijlers\" shirts? I have several
    design friends at CMU in Pittsburgh who would love it.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    issue I think that the organization would likely only object if you started selling
