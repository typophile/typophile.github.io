  body: i&#39;m no pro, so take my advice with a grain or two of salt... <BR> <BR>overall
    i think it&#39;s very nice. One feature i really like is that the diagonals in
    the A, M, V, W, v, w, and y seem to flex or bow just a bit. However the X, Y,
    Z, x and z seem a bit rigid in contrast, perhaps the k as well. <BR> <BR>the eye
    of the e seems a bit small, as do the eyes of the 6 and the 9. the r looks like
    an amputated n. <BR> <BR>keep up the good work!

  body: 'This is actually a semi-serif... Good for you - we need those! <BR> <BR>It
    reminds me a little bit of Costa &#40;my fav Porchez font, finally released for
    retail sale - yay!&#41; but it&#39;s certainly original nonetheless. I&#39;m actually
    liking it a lot - but it needs work. The even tone is nice - it&#39;s an honest,
    but sensitive design. And the stroke terminals are great. <BR> <BR>Lowercase:
    <BR>- The &#34;a&#34; is obnoxious, sorry. It has the worst of Gill Sans, and
    that Jannon imbalance to boot. <BR>- I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a good reason
    to give the &#34;f&#34; a descender. <BR>- The &#34;g&#34; is nice - maybe give
    the head more size versus the tail - the glyph looks way too small compared to
    the rest. <BR>- I think the &#34;k&#34; needs some of the bowing. <BR>- I&#39;m
    unsure about the &#34;w&#34;. <BR>- The &#34;x&#34; needs some of the bowing too,
    and maybe the &#34;z&#34; as well. <BR> <BR>The caps are really nice. <BR>- The
    &#34;L&#34; and &#34;T&#34; seem too wide. <BR>- Consider bowing in the &#34;K&#34;,
    &#34;X&#34;, &#34;Y&#34; and &#34;Z&#34;. <BR>- The &#34;S&#34; needs more balance
    and polish. <BR> <BR>Others: <BR>- Interesting numerals. The &#34;3&#34; is too
    much though. <BR>- I like the 3rd ampersand. A lot. <BR>- Superb &#34;at&#34;
    sign. <BR>- Flatten the UC accents. <BR>- The acute and grave seem a hair too
    strong. <BR> <BR>Spacing: it needs work, but with some tightening I think the
    wordspace you have is good here. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>One thing about the pairing
    with the serif version though - I don&#39;t see them as compatible designs at
    all - certainly not sister types. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    very nice. The bowing is lovely. <BR>Something to keep in mind: most folks can&#39;t
    stand the  <BR>disconnected &#39;Q&#39; in de Groot&#39;s Thesis. Make sure you
    have  <BR>a good reason for yours.'

  body: '&#62; This is actually a semi-serif... <BR> <BR>Well, only the ascenders
    have serifs. That&#39;s 5 characters out of 26. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; It reminds
    me a little bit of Costa <BR> <BR>And it also reminds me of Fedra. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;
    The &#34;a&#34; is obnoxious, sorry. It has the worst of <BR>&#62; Gill Sans,
    and that Jannon imbalance to boot. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think so. The a is fine
    to me. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a good reason to give
    the &#34;f&#34; a descender. <BR> <BR>Me neither. The descender gives too much
    emphasis to the <BR>white space between the f and the next letter. <BR> <BR>I
    think the figures are great, maybe except for 6 and 9; they <BR>need bigger counters.'
