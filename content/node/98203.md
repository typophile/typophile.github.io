  I hit a roadblock. I was rendering my font at 2 point sizes\u201412pt and 20 pt
  and I was comparing it with two other fonts Arial and Calibri. \r\nAt 12 pt:\r\nMy
  font appears unevenly spaced and and jagged. It looks dark when compared to the
  other two. The characters like w, v and bowls of o,q appear thicker than what they
  are supposed to appear. Is this because my font is not hinted?\r\nAt 20 pt:\r\nMy
  font looks okay and still there are some spacing issues(i am going to rectify them)
  but now it is lighter than the remaining two. Since I felt the bowls of q, o etc.
  and other characters(v w) were darker at 12 pt, I reduced the thickness of them
  and now they appear lighter at 20 pt. Am I missing anything here? \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nTypogruffer"

    Adobe Reader is using its own rendering engine independent of the one in Windows."

  body: "The format also has some effect\u2014  many Windows apps use an older rendering
    engine for PostScript-based fonts, which generates grayscale rather than subpixel
    shading.\r\n\r\nWith hinting, you're really talking pixel size or pixels-per-em
    (ppem) rather than point size. It's hard to compare the PDF sample since the pixel
    size is quite a bit larger than in Word (maybe it was zoomed?)."

  body: I am on win 7 and using OpenType PS format as the conversion to true type
    is making the fonts look very rough and jagged. So that problem is because the
    font is unhinted?

  body: "<blockquote>So that problem is because the font is unhinted?</blockquote>\r\nThe
    problem with the appearance of the font at small sizes in Microsoft Word is likely
    because (1) it is unhinted and (2) the fonts to which you're comparing it have
    been extensively hinted in TrueType format, which provides far greater control
    than PostScript hinting and uses a different rasterizer. Office 2013 will use
    the newer DirectWrite engine, which provides improved subpixel rendering for both
    formats."

  body: 'As gargoyle mentioned, TrueType hints offer greater control than Type1 hints,
    and this is particularly noticeable at small sizes. No matter how good your hints
    are, they aren''t going to stand up to a manually (well) hinted TrueType font
    at smaller sizes. Some of these fonts have literally man-years put into hinting
    them.  '

  body: "<blockquote>i can safely conclude that automatic tyoe1 hints are bad, right?</blockquote>\r\nIt
    depends on the font, but it's certainly true that automatic hinting at the time
    of generation \u2014 in either format \u2014 can often result in poorer, more
    irregular rendering than even a completely unhinted font. Better results may be
    achieved by autohinting the font before generation, possibly tweaking some of
    the options and values under Hinting Settings in Font Info, and inspecting/revising
    the hints before generating the final font.\r\n\r\nFor FontLab-specific instructions
    on optimizing the process, see Adam Twardoch's [[http://docs.google.com/document/preview?id=1llTpJsbt2ENbWvMgkGAa90EVfFnTP3Womha3IEumy24&pli=1|Autohinting
    guide]]. For a better handle on basic hinting concepts such as alignment zones
    and standard stems, Miguel Sousa's [[http://vimeo.com/38364880|presentation on
    PostScript hints]] provides a nice visual intro."
