  (notably Plantin, Bembo and Gill Sans) pop up here and there in the past few years
  (indeed, I think this fashion has already been discussed on this forum) but I can't
  find any piece of information about the origins of these particular fonts. Were
  they hot metal fonts before \"going digital\u201D ? When were they designed, and
  by whom ?"

    so it could be a european alternative for Futura.
