		<div class="commentbody">It's a bit ridiculous to talk about 'fonts' when you are looking at some sort of metal castings.  The point is that not EVERYTHING is from a computer font. There was lettering for hundreds of years without digital fonts, and obviously every form of lettering has not been digitized. So much lettering was done by hand, and will never be re-created. <BR> <BR>Chris, it would be nice if you would give us a break, and post one image at a time per thread, and try to consider whether asking about a 'font' for manufactured lettering is a reasonable request. <BR> <BR>Can I ask what your reason is for these shotgun style ID requests?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Chris, sorry about the tenseness of some replies. We've  <BR>experienced an exponential growth since 2003, and since  <BR>the MyFonts forums closed down a couple of months ago  <BR>traffic increased even more. Add to this the Board software  <BR>which behaves erratically and which ate two year's worth of  <BR>archives we used to rely on as reference material plus recent  <BR>postings with multiple IDs per thread&hellip; it tends to get a bit much. <BR> <BR>Also, your identification request might annoyed some of us  <BR>as obviously it's quite unrealistic to expect them to be matched  <BR>with typefaces. Lettering on metal pipes, stone engraving,  <BR>traffic signs and so on all use custom made character sets  <BR>that are specifically produced for the medium they're intended  <BR>for. The medium and technical restrictions determine the shapes, <BR>so it's very hard to come up with equivalents in type. <BR> <BR>I'm not saying this to justify some of the above (over)reactions;  <BR>I only want to put them into context.</div>

Let's get one thing straight.  <BR>You already might've noticed that I'm taking a more pro-active  <BR>stance in policing this Board. This means I <i>will not</i> tolerate childish  <BR>nor rude behaviour, but also that I expect everyone to be courteous,  <BR>even when dealing with what some of us might perceive as  <BR>unrealistic ID requests. Nobody <i>forces</i> anyone to contribute, so  <BR>if you feel the conversation is about to turn sour, I'd rather you  <BR>simply abstain from posting, unless it's really waranted. <BR> <BR>In this particular instance I feel Mike and maybe Christopher as  <BR>well overreacted a bit, as nothing in the original post seemed  <BR>abusive to me.

		<div class="commentbody">Yves - There are a few issues that seem to come up repeatedly - ie multiple IDs in one request, requests without samples linked or attached, requests for freebies, attachments in the wrong format, and (this one really bugs me) threads titled &quot;Please help!&quot;  or &quot;Can you ID this font?&quot; instead of referring to the content. I'm sure there are other issues I'm forgetting. My point is, is there a way in the site header to try to make these points in a slightly more emphatic way - or at least to direct newbies to the FAQ before they go ahead and post?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif" border=0> The newspaper analogy is indeed correct and hilarious to boot! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif" border=0>  <BR> <BR>Chris, Franz is right, and your argumentation is totally front to back. <BR>On a forum entitled Type Identification Board, identifying type and  <BR>helping people is <i>ALL WE DO</i>, so naming the threads &quot;Please help!&quot;  <BR>or &quot;Can you ID this font?&quot; seems pretty superfluous, don't you think? <BR> <BR>Furthermore, please keep in mind that we already helped you  <BR>several times. <i>Nobody's</i> getting paid for this, and &ndash; apart from the  <BR>little slips, granted &ndash; everybody's been very forthcoming, so chill&hellip; <BR>We might bitch and moan, but you had your faces identified, innit?</div>
