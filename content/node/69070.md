  Julius Shulman\" and what I found really attracting other then Shulman's fantastic
  photos was the typeface they used. Unfortunately cameras were forbidden in the theater
  and I was unable to take a picture. So for those who have seen that documentary,
  please identify the typeface they used.\r\n\r\nThank you!"
