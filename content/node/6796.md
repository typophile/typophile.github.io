body: After leaving my sans serif font for a while, I am back on the project formally
  known as Richmond Sans &#40;also on this thread&#41;. <BR> <BR>I have been working
  on the lowercase &#39;e&#39;  and I can&#39;t help but feel that the right of the
  letter doesn&#39;t seem to balance with the rest of the letter. I&#39;ve tried aletring
  it in to a number of different positions over the past hour and can&#39;t seem to
  get it so I m happy with it. <BR> <BR>What do you think? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49509.gif"

  body: You could shear it at the same angle as the lower finial &#40;look at Palatino&#39;s
    &#34;e&#34;&#41;, but I&#39;m not sure I even see a real problem - what you&#39;re
    feeling is probably just the inherent &#34;divergence&#34; in the [conventional]
    Latin alphabet. <BR> <BR>I do see problems in some of the curves however, like
    the join of the left curve to the straight finial being too thin, and the leftmost
    profile being wobbly. <BR> <BR>hhp
