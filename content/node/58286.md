body: Hi,I'm working on a type project for school where we have to design a book of
  a classic american author. I have william faulkner. He's a bit crazy, deals with
  a lot of non linear storytelling, stream of consciousness, and multiple authors.  However
  most of his subject matter takes place in civil war south so I feel like i need
  a font that is at once classic feeling and edgy.  I need to choose two fonts- a
  display and a body copy font.  Any suggestions?

  body: The obvious choice is the fonts from the first edition of one of his more
    popular works, especially there's anything notable about them. I'd take a look
    at them in a library.

  body: "I'd suggest a slightly different approach than Thomas Levine's. Indeed, start
    at the library and look at editions of Faulkner's writings. But not only at the
    first editions. See how his texts have been handled over many decades. Then see
    how you can \"improve\" upon them or how you can work with the texts in ways that
    make sense to you. Keep in mind the ways in which Faulkner's books were set and
    printed when they were new. See if today's types and printing methods point the
    way for you. \r\n\r\nHave fun. & try to read as much of his work as you can. It
    is great writing.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Unless I've forgotten too much in the past 40 years, only one of Faulkner's
    books is set in the Civil War years.\r\n\r\nYou should always read a manuscript
    (in this case, a book?) before selecting an appropriate typeface. Going out on
    a limb, e.g., without knowing what *this* book is, I'd probably pick a Scotch
    roman for the text. There are two digital fonts that are workable and have a \"Scotch\"
    origin. One is Monticello, perhaps better for older texts. The other is Miller.
    Both were done (digitaly) by Matthew Carter. \r\n\r\nWhether or not a bourbon
    drinker could favor a Scotch font is better left to the bourbon drinkers.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    after enough bourbon or scotch you could explain why you need a separate display
    font?"

    at]] three first editions. Typeface isn't so consistent among them as the general
    layout. This is largely related to the publisher, of course, so you may consider
    comparing his books to others of the time of both the same and different publishers.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I second Will's suggestion."
