  frame such as a baroque or rococo frame found on inner covers of old books which
  encloses the title - a frame around the title.  Does anyone know what the technical
  word for these pesky things is as I'd like to find some examples on the internet.
  \ Many thanks."

    types of frames.

  body: W.A. Dwiggins called them "border designs" or just "borders" in a 1927 essay
    on the structure of the book (quoted by Ruari McLean in <em>The Thames and Hudson
    Manual of Typography</em> -- page 149 in my edition).
