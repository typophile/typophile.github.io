body: "Hi there\r\n\r\nHere is a question on mid-points. I know they are used for
  quantities and monetary units, but how about time? For example, what would be the
  correct typographic use for mid-points in this case: 10.30h or 10\xB730h?\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\nm"

    Anyway, usage changes according to each country conventions/standards. "
