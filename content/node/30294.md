  some of the top illustrators in the field:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.illoz.com/\r\n\r\nIt
  was put together by a web designer/illustrator, along with help from a number of
  other artists, including myself.  Registration for designers and art directors is
  free and there are some wonderful features at the site, including virtual workspaces
  and ways to pick and organize the work of artists that you like.\r\n\r\nThis website
  is the result of many months of discussion and thinking by some of the top illustrators
  in the field. We were frustrated with the online options that were available for
  us to show our work to designers such as yourselves.  Please check it out, we hope
  to add more artists to the group soon.  Any comments would be greatly appreciated,
  it's still a work in progress.   Thanks."

  body: "I found it a good area to show work, my main criticism, after a short glance,
    is that the slideshow's transitions are too quick not giving one enough time to
    appreciate the item and that the stop slideshow button doesn't seem to stop at
    the slide one clicks it at; of course the transition time is a tricky thing to
    calculate on the one hand you don't want it so slow that a viewer gets bored and
    on the other you do want to give your work a chance.\r\nTim"

    on. It needs to slow down just a little bit to be able to see the work.\r\n\r\nDavid,
    what don't you get?\r\n\r\nER"

  body: "Another minor thing, when in a portfolio and I want to visit another portfolio
    by the same illustrator I have to hover over a small icon to see the title of
    the folio, it would be more user friendly if the title were visible.\r\nTim\r\nbtw
    your Chairman Mao in Louis Vuitton reminded me of this one by Gerald Scarfe (not
    a brilliant picture but you get the idea)\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/mondoagogo/115892308/in/pool-martinparr/"

  body: Thanks Tim, that small icon feature was added right before the launch, I think
    having the title visible is a good idea.
