  been independently published in December.\r\nI just ordered a copy so I can't say
  how it compares to the Rob Roy Kelley books, but the photos of the actual type next
  to printed proofs is a nice touch. There is an animated preview video on the site
  http://www.theartofwoodtype.com/"

    it all evening long. (I guess you saw that coming.) Be careful, though, doing
    this too often might give you shingles!

  body: "I've posted a bit of a review on my site at \r\n\r\nhttp://fraterdeus.com\r\n\r\nHave
    been corresponding with Greg Ruffa, the author/publisher. Greg also redrew all
    the type in the book.\r\nYes. From scratch... each of the wood faces was redrawn
    in Illustrator for the 'specimen' on the verso pages...\r\nThat is, the photos
    are on one page, and his renderings on the facing page... not printed proofs!\r\n\r\nOf
    course, the question arises of publishing them as fonts, but I really don't know
    if there would be an economic return on the investment. Many of the faces don't
    have numerals, for examples, and rarely have more than a couple of 'points', barely
    a $ to be found. So, to make them 'commercially' viable, a substantial amount
    of work would have to be done.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on this from the community?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\nhttp://alphabets.com\r\nhttp://slowprint.com/almostfreelp

    heard great thing about them, just never had a chance to read them. I love those
    gorgeous photos of the sets of type.\r\n\r\nHope everything is going great in
    Buffalo, Mr. Kegler."

  body: "Hello Paul, \r\nSorry I only occasionally visit Typophile\r\nThings are going
    great but I am spending more time on the Ludlow Typograph than on FontLab.\r\n\r\nThe
    woodtype book has a few factual \"issues\" (IE futura bold was not a circa 1900
    woodtype design) and I would have preferred seeing actual warts-and-all printed
    proofs of the type next to the photos instead of outline renderings, but it is
    still a must have book."

  body: "I just received my copy yesterday. Haven't had time to read it - I'm waiting
    to devour it with coffee and plenty of free time... but I did glance at every
    page and looked up a couple of things I was particularly interested in.\r\n\r\nI've
    also had some correspondence with the author, Greg Ruffa, about one of the types
    in the book. He is so pleasant and passionate about this subject, and has lots
    more info in his head than any book could ever demonstrate. He humbly admits to
    some factual errors and inconsistencies that often plague labors of love, but
    those don't deter from the overall product. As a wood type freak who can't afford
    to get all the Morgan Press and RRK and even rarer specimens...\r\n\r\nI'm very
    pleased with my purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
