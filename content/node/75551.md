    backgrounds do well in school. I have felt that this is clearly a cultural matter
    - the <em>bar mitzvah</em> and the Imperial civil service examination have made
    book learning an expression of these groups' <em>own</em> culture, so, unlike
    the case of members of some other minorities that suffer discrimination, they
    aren't tempted to see book learning in terms of knuckling under to the dominant
    culture.\r\n\r\nSince Hebrew - and even more so, Chinese - are \"difficult\" to
    read, I wonder if this was a misguided inspiration for this research.\r\n\r\nBut
    maybe we can \"slow the mind down\" by giving the children fun puzzles to solve,
    inside of which their lessons are hidden... to avoid the hating school problem.
    Or, better yet, video games!"

  body: "I have read the Yauman, Oppenheimer, and Vaughn paper. The newspaper reports
    got the finding slightly wrong. It\u2019s not actually possible to say that the
    font caused disfluency because they confounded font, size, and luminance contrast.
    In the first study they compared 16 point, 100% luminance contrast, Arial to 75%
    luminance contrast, 12 point, Comic Sans Italic and Bodoni. It\u2019s not possible
    to say that the font was the source of the difference as it equally could have
    been the size or luminance contrast. That is only a problem with the newspaper
    account, and not with the Yauman et.al. paper itself.\r\n\r\nI do think Yauman
    et.al. made a methodological mistake. They showed that there were higher memory
    recall rates for the 12 point, 75% contrast fonts, but didn\u2019t do anything
    to show that those fonts were actually more disfluent. Had they performed some
    other sort of performance test, or even asked the participants to rate the fluency,
    there point would be more convincing. I would accept that reduced contrast lowers
    fluency, but am less confident about the size or font differences.\r\n\r\nThe
    big question here is that this is the exact opposite finding from the Song & Schwarz
    (2008) paper that we\u2019ve discussed elsewhere. In that study people rated 12
    point Arial as being more legible than 12 point Mistral and Brush Script, and
    it was shown that people judged that the tasks described in the text would be
    easier to complete when written in Arial. That study suggested that fluency is
    beneficial, but of course is a different task from a memory task. Song & Schwarz
    also had a memory task in their study, but didn\u2019t find a difference on that
    measure.\r\n\r\nI think the effect of fluency/disfluency is an interesting mystery.\r\n"

    in the part of the motor cortex that controls your legs. Even though you are aware

    the muscles would be used a bit differently. And the more subconscious the act
    is, the more the deviation. If a doctor asks you to \"breathe normally\", it's
    anything but. That's why whenever they can doctors engage you in idle banter while
    they're checking your vitals.\r\n\r\n> the brain doesn\u2019t have multiple different
    mechanisms\r\n> for reading that you can choose between.\r\n\r\nI guess it depends
    on how you define mechanism. I believe that any given act of reading is a hybrid
    between two very different <em>strategies</em> if not mechanisms; and one of the
    strategies (the slower, deliberative one) is heavily favored when the reader knows
    he's being measured. This difference is simply much harder to observe than muscle
    movements - but I believe it exists. Why? Not least because that makes sense;
    and the brain <em>not</em> taking advantage of information that's right in front
    of its eyes (well, to the side :-) makes no sense.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    same reaction as Kevin did to the disfluency assumptions. It's particularly problematic
    in relation to Comic Sans. At least in the UK, Comic Sans has been used extremely
    widely in education for at least 10 years. Teachers I've nagged about the phenomenon
    (which, I have on good authority, is prescribed in teaching schools) attest to
    its ability to distinguish between, on the one hand, \u2018personal\u2019 material,
    prepared by that teacher for that class (just as handwritten & photocopied sheets
    were used in my day), and, on the other hand, material simply photocopied from
    books, generated from \u2018official\u2019 teaching materials, or cut & pasted
    from the web.\r\n\r\nI therefore find it easy to hypothesize, undermining the
    assumptions of the article\u2019s authors, that:\r\n\r\n* today's students find
    Comic Sans very legible and \u2018fluent\u2019\r\n* students engage better (since
    it pays off better) with material in which the teacher demonstrates a personal
