  in Sweden about 10 years ago? I think the name is CAP. And if I recall, it's only
  for mac.\r\n\r\nAll I got left is in outlines.. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typsnitt_6447.jpg]\r\nThe
  \"g\" is weary characteristic\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typsnittG_4231.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? \r\n\r\nThanks"
