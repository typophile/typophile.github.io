  body: Hi. I'm looking for a free font that is geometric  like  Optima or Futura,
    but with thick and thin lines, somewhat like the Rea Irvin font for New Yorker.  Was
    reading the thread here [[Looking for Vogue]], several geometrics mentioned, but
    none with the thick/thin aspect.  My brother tells me he has one on his PC and
    he's certainly not one to purchase any fonts.  Any clues?  Most of my font experience
    is with Adobe.  Thanks.
