  2D family fonts comprise folk ornaments found on Hutsul ceramics of the mid 19th
  to early 20th centuries.\r\n\r\nHutsulshchyna is an ethnic region in the Ukrainian
  Carpathian Mountains where folk art and indigenous culture preserve up to nowadays.
  All images are to the maximum approximated folk prototypes. The graphics are characterized
  with grotesque, stylization simplicity, surprising plot moves. The font cheers up
  and evokes positive emotions.\r\n\r\nDesigners: Iryna Korchuk\r\n\r\nMore info on
