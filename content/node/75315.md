body: "Hi folks.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to hyphenation while my case-feature is active
  (and positioning some glphys a 100 units higher) a missing glyph right after the
  hyphen occures. \u201C.notdef\u201D is displayed. This only happens when case-feature
  is active (positioning the hyphen). \r\n\r\nMy theory is that this may be because
  case feature is described in the spec as GSUB features, not GPOS. Can anyone confirm
  or discard this? Sadly I couldn't find the OT specs for this on my own.\r\n\r\nIf
  not: What is the reason for this missing glyph? How to fix this? \r\n\r\nI really
  hope someone can help me with this problem. \r\n\r\nPS: This does not happen if
  I insert a hyphen manually."
