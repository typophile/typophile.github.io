  experts!\r\n\r\nThis isn't so much as an font identification question, but a request
  for a font recommendation. I've been able to trace this image in Illustrator for
  use in a 15' map graphic that will be inscribed in granite. I like the historic
  handwritten look of the lettering. However but when I trace the text the font shapes
  look terrible. I've been thinking about replacing the text outlines with an actual
  font, which would save me from having to shape the curves to something pleasing
  to the eye?\r\n\r\nDo you have any recommendations? Map was drawn in 1850.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/darmap0203-Edit2_1000x915_4760.shkl.jpg]"

  body: Have a look at <a href="http://typophile.com/node/50220">this older thread</a>.
    The typefaces mentioned there do not have a hand-lettered look, but are 19th/early
    20th century grotesques, or inspired by such.

  body: "Type won't capture the charming irregular quality of words like LIBERTY,
    or GREENSBURG's bend.\r\nYour best bet is to draw the letters as paths in Illustrator,
    and then stroke those paths.\r\nThat will also provide consistency of line in
    different sizes (e.g. FIFTH and VIRGIN).\r\nIt will be meticulous and time-consuming
    work, but will produce far better results than auto-tracing letter outlines.\r\nThe
    effect will still be a somewhat unnatural, compared to the original engraved script,
    but that should be mitigated by the medium of granite etching."

  body: "I was worried somebody would tell me that I had to do this all by hand!  I
    definitely see how tracing the letters will result in a final design that feels
    more like the original.  And the more I researched fonts, the more I realized
    that an exact match does not exist.\r\n\r\nI had thought about using a font like
    Gotham Rounded or something like that and scaling / hand placing each letter individually,
    on top of the map graphic, to preserve scale and spacing.  Still thinking it all
    over. And will share the final results...\r\n\r\n I appreciate everybody's input!"

  body: Nice suggestions here. Nick, is right of course. But if you want to start
    with type, do think irregular. Gotham Rounded is too consistent. Even tho it's
    more early 1900s and German, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/scangraphic/din_17_sb_regular_ot/">DIN
    17</a> (derived from template-assisted hand-lettering) might be more appropriate
    with some adjustments.

  body: "Thanks for all your advice!  \r\n\r\nI took Nick's advice and did not try
    alter the original map with any overset text.  Instead I worked with the map graphic
    in illustrator to try to make the text as rounded and legible as possible.  Anything
    else would have not preserved the hand crafted character of the original graphic.
    \ The trickiest part was working with Live Trace.  I had to make sure that the
    graphic got simplified but not overly abstracted.\r\n\r\nThe map will be approximately
    16' x 16'.  We were pretty excited to see the mock up sample."
