  site as air con has broke and its just tooo hot to be creative today!\r\n\r\nAnyway.
  thoughts on the attached please. Pro Bono job. New Estate agents setting up in Manchester.
  3 experienced guys. They wanted to move away from the cliche big friendly colourful
  brands and go for a more classy/established feel. The sting in the tail is they
  have a marketing/copywriter who used to work for the Economist so he's hopefully
  gonna bring the money making to the party.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously not just banging
  out a logo. A lot of my time has been put into the overall brand feel. I have sent
  a sketch over to them which they were very happy with. Below is the digital version.
  I obviously can't ask my fellow designers about this being freelance. Awkward name
  but thoughts please...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    it is for a company that does business in the real estate / properties sector.
    (I think?) So to me, that is a good concept.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed finding the key,
    and I think overall it definitely has a classy feel. Perhaps you can play with
    the proportions of the logo and the horizontal rule / company name in relation
    to each other.\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

  body: "<cite>I enjoyed finding the key</cite>\r\n\r\nI did too! At first, I didn't
    get why the G had a notch in it, but finding the key made me feel like I learned
    a secret. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to increase the weight (just slightly)
    of the horizontal part of the key (the body of the key?). As is, it might get
    lost at smaller sizes. Along those lines, have you tried making it smaller to
    see how the notch in the key holds up?"

    is fun. I''m not sold on the font you''ve selected for the name. It''s too close
    to but doesn''t match the GF. I''d like to see it match the Didot(?) or go with
    something that will contrast more like a sans. '

    more like an older key?\r\n\r\nLike these:\r\n\r\nhttp://flyowa.com/Flight424/old-key.jpg\r\nhttp://www.antique-hardware.com/key.jpg\r\nhttp://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&size=l&tid=1248794\r\n\r\nIf
    that is what your concept is going for."

    that supposed to be a key? I'm not sure what keys look like over there, but I
    find it plenty confusing. Or are you perhaps looking at this, in the negative
    space?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/key2_5919.gif]\r\nMaybe I'm just
    being dense (and indeed I haven't had my coffee yet this morning), but I would
    think it needs to be clearer."

  body: "I think it's a good concept and it does have an 'ah' moment (so to speak)
    where you see the key. But then again, the fact that I already knew it was an
    estate agent before I saw the picture means I was impartial from the start.\r\n\r\nI
    know you've left a gap between the shaft of the key and the top half of the F
    to imply the key going into a lock (or at least that's how I see it), but maybe
    try losing the gap, widening the shaft of the key and making the handle look like
    a key handle (don't worry about it not being consistent with the rest of the F),
    then you'd definitely lose the trumpet that people seem to be seeing.\r\n\r\nThen
    again, all those things I've suggested might not look good if implemented. Just
    trying to give some ideas."

  body: "I think it does look like a key, i would suggest a few improvements though;
    The key does look good but it needs some kind of end that should be added to the
    F that makes it look like a trumpet. I would suggest a circle or a oval. The typeface
    is a tad heavy and the ampersands is very nasty, i suggest Trajan pro. Both elements
    the type and image need to be moved closer the line separater by a lil tiny bit.
    The top type is very nice but text underneath really needs to look cleaner and
    crisper. The top font needs to reflect the bottom. You should try and find fonts
    that match or are the same.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion you have a fantastic idea and
    the final product will look great.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Oliver\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6322.png]"
