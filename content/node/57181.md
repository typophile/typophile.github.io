body: "Has anyone else noticed the beautiful blackletter typeface that is used in
  the New York Times Style Magazine? It is the best blackletter typeface I\u2019ve
  come across in a long time but I can\u2019t figure out what the name of it is, if
  its for sale, or if it was created specifically for the magazine. The only things
  I\u2019ve uncovered is that the T logo itself was designed by Matthew Carter. I
  thought that maybe Carter designed the accompanying blackletter typeface as well
  but I\u2019ve not been able to track it down. I have actually e-mailed the New York
  Times asking about the name of the typeface, but of course they haven\u2019t answered
  back. Any clues, suggestions, answers would be helpful. Thanks.\r\n\r\n-Mariel\r\n\r\nLink

  I've had one person answer and say that it is called NYT-FrakturSix, but I can't
  find that font for purchase or download and that is what I am interested in doing. "

    fonts, such as Cheltenham or Stymie, just redrawn. You may be able to find something
    very close.

    Nope. That\u2019s what What the Font suggests, but it\u2019s not. The NYT blackletter
    isn\u2019t even a [[Fraktur]], strictly speaking. It\u2019s a [[Textura]].\r\n\r\nCheck
    out English textura faces like Cloister Black or Old English. They will bring
    you much closer. Here\u2019s an <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/15773\">older
    thread about that style</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.typografie.de/Unsere-Buecher/Typografie/Judith-Schalansky/Fraktur-mon-Amour::589.html\">Fraktur
    mon Amour</a> is a great book. The second edition (enhanced, in German and English)
    is out now. Yes, it comes with a CD full of Blackletter fonts, for private and
    restricted commercial use. Fontblogger J\xFCrgen Siebert made a <a href=\"http://www.fontblog.de/picts/FrakturMonAmour.pdf\">PDF

  body: "There are a number of different New York Times blackletter fonts in use,
    particularly in the \"T Magazine\". Some of the differences among them are subtle,
    while some are fairly extreme. All of the fonts and designs are proprietary and
    created or adapted for the Times by Matthew Carter.\r\n\r\n1) FrakturSix-NYT \r\n
    \  This is the font that's used for most of the captions and blackletter text
    in T-Style Magazine. It has a large character component with some limited punctuation
    characters. It includes lower case accented characters but none in the upper case.
    There are many character positions containing no glyphs, a faulty upper case \"Z\"
    that hasn't been fixed in four years, and a few alternate glyphs that look left
    over from the creation process.\r\n\r\n2) Fraktur NYT\r\n Used sparingly, this
    has sharper corners, straighter lines, and heavier spurs than Fraktur-Six. Thus
    far, I've found only 24 lower case letters (missing j and q) and only 2 upper
    case letters (A and R). The \"A\" is strikingly different than the \"A\" in Fraktur-Six,
    with an ornament similar to that on the \"N\" of the nameplate.\r\n\r\n3)NYTimes-MagStyle
    Bold\r\n  Used ONLY for spelling out \"The New York Times Style Magazine\", and
    contains only the necessary characters.  I haven't found out about anything concerning
    the glyphs use in the rarely appearing \"Real Estate Magazine\".\r\n\r\n4) NYTimes-FourCapT\r\n
    \ Contains a number of variants of the unique T Magazine \"T\" logo.\r\n\r\nOccasionally
    a font will appear with a name like \"Fraktur-Eleven NYT\" but these appear to
    be personally created versions of Fraktur-Six containing only a limited number
    of glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe designs used for the newspaper's nameplate and New York
    Times Magazine are different from each other, and different from the fonts listed
    above. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Regular]]!\r\nIt's a near-perfect match, but with clean edges.  I would be very
    surprised if there is a closer non-custom font.\r\n\r\nThe clean-up is especially
    noticeable on the left serif on the right arm of the Y.  The biggest other difference
    I see is the shape of the little ornament on the vertical bar inside the T, changed
    from an arrowhead to a diamond.  Also, the flourishes have been enlarged and their
    curvature increased\u2014look at the lower right of the h, the left of the N (top
    and middle), and the left of the Y.\r\n\r\n(Sorry for reviving, but this page
    hits high on Google, so I thought this might be useful to researchers like myself.)"
