    one of my favourite movies <em>(O Lucky Man)</em> hasn't made it to DVD, although
    I'd kill for a copy. (I do have the soundtrack on vinyl....)

    only where credit is due. Yes, I did name that TV show after my affliction (which,
    by the way, is incurable, but not lethal), but I did not come up with \"Kern up
    the volume\". My name for that roadshow was \"Spinal Type\", but then my colleagues
    at the ISTD got scared in case some big movie company came after us. I didn't
    share that fear (having survived numerous attacks by Harvey Hunt, Hollywood laywers
    don't frighten me), but was persuaded to drop it. ISTD council came up with the
    Kern title \u2013 not sure whether Freda Sack, Jonathan Dorney or any of the other
    members want to take personal credit. "
