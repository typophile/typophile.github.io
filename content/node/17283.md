  body: Thanks for your suggestions, Tiffany. Can anyone suggest an exact match? I'm
    certain I've seen this before but maybe its just the style thats familiar and
    my brain is being fooled. Somehow, though I can't shake the feeling this is familiar.
    Very frustrating. Any help much appreciated.
