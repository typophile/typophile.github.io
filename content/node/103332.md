body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nIn OpenType \u2013 if I understand well \u2013 there are only
  two possible rules - SUBSTITUTION and POSITION (either/or/both).\r\n\r\nWhy isn't
  there a rule for SCALE?\r\n\r\nFor example, when the ALL CAPS \"TT\" is triggered
  in InDesign, scale the glyphs \"(\", \")\", \"{\" and \"}\" up to 110% (from zero
  point/from centre/from cap height/from ascender height etc).\r\n\r\nIf such a rule
  does not exist, it's either because it defeats some other purpose, or is unnecessary
  or is carried out by something else... and that I'm missing a point.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Simply scaling would change the weight relationship and in most situations
    would make things look wrong. Witness the disdain for faux small caps and faux
    fractions. A more sophisticated rule could probably be devised (probably relying
    upon hints), but would require a sophisticated implementation built into layout
    and rasterizing engines and would be highly unlikely to gain any traction I suspect.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    parentheses and braces are generally scaled down (in size, but not weight) for
    all-caps settings, not up. "

  body: I'm not certain of the coding, but couldn't you use contextual alternates
    for substitution with alternate glyphs?

  body: That would still require creating new glyphs instead of applying an action/effect
    to existing glyphs.

  body: It does solve the problem in the absence of other options. Or, am I missing
    something. Even if there is an operation for scale, existing software has to support
    it.

    an action/effect to existing glyphs on the design end, where you have greater
    opportunity to evaluate and refine the results on a situational basis, rather
    than at the rasterization end where you will have little control and where one
    size rarely fits all.\r\n\r\nFor alternative approaches, you can explore parameterized
    design and the Metafont format developed by Knuth for use in conjunction with
    TeX."
