    have no contextual subs than bad ones, every day. \r\nIn addition, kerning may
    work fine at the gigantic sizes you're showing, but without sufficient control
    over rendering, smaller sizes will be screaming the same thing, \"no kerning is
    better than this kerning.\"\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    they can fix them for 3.1. \r\n\r\nAs for the kerning, I haven\u2019t noticed
    it making anything less legible so far, but the web is still mostly limited to
    type carefully considered for onscreen use. Maybe it will be a lot worse for all
    the fonts out there that weren\u2019t. "

    less than perfect... and typography has to look perfect, especially in the internet
    age.\r\n\r\nThanks for the blog link, it was informative to say the least. \r\n\r\nJon. "
