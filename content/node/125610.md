body: "I am working on some eBooks for classic text, in PDF format. I like faces such
  as Arno, Minion, Aldus, Jenson. But the problem is that none of them looks good
  on screen. Take Arno for example, even with my 900 degree short-sighted eyes, on
  a 264 DPI iPad screen, I can see the pixels on the edges of serifs, if I look hard.
  And even at a reading distance, those pixels are quite perceptible.\r\n\r\nI know
  that there are fonts designed specially for low resolution mediums with more robust
  forms. Yet, I like Renaissance letters too much. And actually, when I give my GF,
  who I am making the book for, a dozen sample texts of faces to pick which she liked,
  including likes of those mentioned above, as well as Baroque letters such as Caslon,
  Adobe Text, and more recent designs such as Chaparral, and a few others, all considered
  by myself fine faces, she picked  every Aldine/Venetian letters, either directly
  revival such as Jenson, near relative such as Garamond, or those inspired by Mannerist
  forms such as Aldus, and left out everyone else. This is much to my delight and
  surprise (she had no typography knowledge at all, and can't tell the difference
  between Times and Utopia if I asked.)\r\n\r\nSo the quest remains to me to find
  a face with the same elegant humanist forms yet looks better on screen. One that
  I am considering purchasing is Iowan Old Style. Does anyone has anything else to
  suggest?"
