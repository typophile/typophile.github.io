  body: Hi Francesco, we&#39;ve had this one before, and we couldn&#39;t  <BR>find
    a perfect match, so our best guess is this was custom  <BR>designed for the movie.
    There were several typefaces we  <BR>came up with that are similar, but unfortunately
    the big bad  <BR>archives ate most of our past threads, so I couldn&#39;t dig
    it up.
