    to see the big thick issues we see nowadays, though. I've seen some CAs from the
    80s and they are half as thick as the current ones.

  body: "<em>CA was not as thick because it had way fewer ads.</em>\r\n\r\nHeh-heh,
    and I thought it was just because of the lack of extra-thick paper samples.\r\n\r\n<em>And
    those back cover ads for typefaces are priceless!</em>\r\n\r\nI hadn't even thought
    of that.  :-)  U&lc had some great ones, but those are from the 70s, of course."
