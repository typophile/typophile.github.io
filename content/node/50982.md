  family but I was wondering:\r\n\r\nWould it be too much to ask to do all the work
  myself but to ask another to simply convert the .ai vectors into an actual font
  using the appropriate software? I have everything I need... my hands and Illustrator...
  but I don't have a font program and as this stage in the game it's far too much
  to invest in.\r\n\r\nThat was my only question. I'm not quite sure how much work
  it'd be to take ready-made letters and then, bring them into the correct software.\r\n\r\nMuchas
  Gracias--"

    the characters are initially drawn it's a bit of a big ask. Plus characters will
    need to be re-drawn along the way. You're seeking a patient saint!\r\n\r\nYou
    never know what people are willing to do though. Maybe there's a business niche
    being missed for out-sourced kerning and hinting."

    was entirely developmental. That no additional design/artistry was necessary.
    So I wouldn't dare ask.\r\n\r\nThanks--"

  body: James, I would contact some type foundries - T-26, Typetrust, Fontshop, PsyOps,
    Fountain, to name just a few, show them your design and see if they're interested.
    If they like the design, most of these places will develop your drawings into
    a functioning typeface. There may be some independent type designers around here
    that would do the same for a fee, and/or split in royalties. It really depends
    on the appeal of your design. You might want to post some word settings to see
    if folks are interested.

    would balk at it but as long as each party is happy with the agreement there shouldn't
    be a problem.\r\n\r\nm"

  body: 'Kyle, there are multiple reasons to design in a font program rather than
    Illustrator, including: 1. You can easily preview your letters in combination
    with other letters, in words, at will. This is critical to a good font. 2. There
    are problems transferring from Illustrator to a font program, so it is easier
    for all concerned to start in a font program. Google with preface of site:typophile.com,
    and you will find threads on it. 3. The drawing tools in font programs themselves
    make it easier to adjust curves for letters. I think that anyone who does it will
    tell you that investing $99 for a basic program is worth it. And also get "Learn
    FontLab Fast". Then when it comes to kerning and all the technical stuff and expansion
    of character set, etc., you may, if it is good, be able to get a foundry to do
    it with by sharing profits, or, if not, paying them to do the work. '

    to RTFM this afternoon) it accepts AI, or at least SVGs which AI can export.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl
