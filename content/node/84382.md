  crash a lot). Wouldn't it be good to create an IRC chat room with type design as
  a topic? Anyone interested?\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n"

  body: This has come up before. I suppose if you just went onto freenode and used
    typophile for the channel, and convinced enough people to join. But you may be
    best off scheduling a time and date. Typophiles tend to be rather busy these days...
    Cutting types and letterpressing... Maybe using fontforge or doing some daily
    job. IRC just doesn't fit in so easily...

  body: But, yes, I would be interested. I personally haven't met anyone else who
    does type.

    that sort of thing there, plus video chat (hangouts).

    \r\nI still think IRC chat have some advantages, but it is true that for some
    people IRC is out of fashion (and you have to install special software)."
