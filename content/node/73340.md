  the optical spacing function in inDesign, but it looked a bit tight so I added 10.
  At 12 pts this looks perfect, but at 8 it's way to tight. If I had to choose one
  point size to decide my spacing issue upon I'd choose 10pnts, but anyhow I think
  it's also very suit for logo's, which are bigger and thus need looser spacing. Is
  there anything I can do about this, or is it up to the designer to add increase
  the spacing if needed? What is the most common text-size?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJasper
  de Waard"

  body: Due to the delicate/subtle nature of the design, I wouldn't recommend using
    it at sizes smaller than 12 pt; and larger (and bolder) type usually takes less,
    rather than looser, spacing.

  body: Thanks for your comment oldnick. The delicate gaps get lost at text-sizes
    anyway, but I still like it without the gaps. Have you printed the pdf and do
    you judge it no good for anything under 12 pnts or do you guess so because of
    the delicate design? I don't mean to offend you, but if you haven't yet, I think
    you should print the pdf to be able to judge it properly.

  body: "In my [[http://markbattypublisher.com/books/typography-monographs-volume-2-size-specific-adjustments-to-type-designs-an-investigation-of-the-principles-guiding-the-design-of-optical-sizes/|book
    about optical sizes]] there is also short chapter on spacing. This is what I found
    out in my research:\r\n\r\n<cite>The ideal spacing for a certain design and size
    is influenced by several factors: the optical resolution of human perception,
    crowding, rhythm and, in the large sizes, the specific situation and taste. In
    very small sizes the minimum space between the letters is determined by the distance
    that is required in order to recognize two objects as separate, as explained in
    section 4.1. Furthermore, adding spacing helps reduce the effects of crowding.
    In the large sizes, however, the tightness of the setting is not limited by these
    perceptual factors.\r\nAnother guideline is that the space between the letters
    should be in a harmonious relation to the space within: \u201CSpacing and width
    go hand in hand\u201D (Slimbach 2007). If the letters are set too tightly the
    counters become bigger than the inter-letter space, which looks inharmonious.
    The collective opinion on how tight the setting can be without looking congested
    seems to change over the decades, however. In the 1970s and 1980s it was not uncommon
    to set type in display sizes far more closely than would be considered acceptable
    today. Sometimes even professional typographers do not agree on the ideal amount
    of space between the letters. Unger (2007b) reports that his standard fitting
    of his Gulliver was considered too tight by Spiekermann whereas a newspaper that
    intended to use it was envisaging even tighter setting than Unger\u2019s default.\r\nThe
    situation in which the type is used is another factor that determines the spacing.
    If the fonts are to be used predominantly in rather loose layouts like books the
    default spacing should be looser than, for example, in fonts for newspaper headlines,
    where the typographers generally prefer tight setting. On the other hand, if type
    is set vertically or inverted, the spacing has to be increased significantly (Forssman
    et al. 2004).\r\nFortunately, the overall tracking can be adjusted by the typographer
    to suit the specific needs. In case optical sizes are not available this is the
    only size dependent aspect the typographer can improve. However, as Bi\u013Eak
    (2007) points out, many type users are not aware of the necessity of this adjustment
    so specialised fonts with built-in tracking adjustment are a sensible means to
    make sure the type is appropriately spaced, especially if it is not expected to
    be used only by expert typographers. In this context it is astonishing that many
    digital designs do not make use of this opportunity at all. On the other hand,
    it should be kept in mind that similar spacing for all fonts facilitates their
    comparison, which is helpful if the most appropriate master has to be chosen for
    an in-between size where two masters come into question.\r\nFriedrich Forssman
    et al.\u202F(2004) show a list which serves as a guideline when working with single
    master fonts (Fig.\u200944) and could provide a basis for manually tuned size
    variants. For typefaces that show adaptations only in details a general increase
    of spacing can serve as a starting point (Schwartz 2007, Crossgrove 2007, Smeijers
    2007). However, global increase of tracking can result in \u201Coverly loose rounds,
    or serifs that are too far apart\u201D (Schwartz 2007), which then require manual
    adjustments. According to Crossgrove (2007), \u201Cintricate shapes like s, E,
    g or combinations like PA and Tv really look very different at different sizes\u201D.
    If the glyphs show a significantly different design the spacing must be worked
    out from scratch for each size (Kobayashi 2007, Porchez 2007). This corresponds
    with Bi\u013Eak\u2019s (2007) and Karow\u2019s (1998) conviction that not only
    spacing but also kerning needs to be size-specific.</cite>\r\n\r\nSorry, I don't
    have the time to extract the sources from the bibliography right now. Most of
    the 2007 sources are personal communication."
