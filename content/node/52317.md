body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for any suggestions on a dotted typeface that doesn't
  look like technology. Would like one with a human feel similar to Stag Dot which
  is nice, but only comes in light made of one line. Would be nice to have the typeface
  like Stag Dot with light, med, bold weights.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    Dots Pack." With 33 fonts, you should find what you're looking for -- including
    multiple weights.

  body: Maybe <a href="http://typophile.com/node/50437">Quicksand</a>? That has two
    weights. I guess it's dashed rather than dotted, though.

  body: thanks for the suggestions, but is there something out there more monoline
    and the dots don't follow the grid?
