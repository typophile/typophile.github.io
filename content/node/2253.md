  actually a collage from a more extensive setting. The font is the #19 of the Phelps,
  Dalton & Co., and was probably made at the end of the 19th century. This makes it
  the earliest \"true\" hubrid numeral scheme I've encountered - in fact by far: the
  most recent ones I knew of previously were in Fenway (Carter) and some of de Groot's
  work. The Austin numerals (like the kind Carter has recreated in Miller) have some
  hybrid traits, but I find them too irregular (although in a nice way) to really
  qualify as a scheme.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this might be an opportunity to find a better
  name for \"hybrid numerals\", and I propose calling them \"Boston numerals\", not
  just because of this Phelps design, but also because Carter is in Boston. Luc[as]
  loses out though.  :-(\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?\r\n\r\n(I hope Rodolfo and

    <BR> <BR>Yeah gotta love those figures but I am far from recommending them as
    a candidate to completely &#34;purge oldstyle figures in text&#34;.  <BR> <BR><i>Cast
    brass early Boston hardware store figures</i> probably predate Hrant&#39;s showings.
    Which is neither here nor there. John Downer would find nothing unusual about
    that. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t speak loudly or Mike Parker may show up. Boston hardware
    store figs are those which Starling Burgess based for one of his typefaces.  <BR>
    <BR>Goudy had used these style figures in Forum Title. The figure 4 in Goudy&#39;s
    give more probability for a balance setting. Notice dates in Hrant&#39;s showing.

  body: '&#62; New England figures. <BR> <BR>That seems much better than &#34;Boston&#34;.
    <BR>But I&#39;m realizing that if there&#39;s going to be any geographic reference,
    it really needs to be Scotland: both Austin and Phemister were Scottish &#40;although
    the latter&#39;s working life was in New England&#41;. The former certainly deserves
    credit for breaking from the oldstyle/lining polarity&#42;, and the latter might
    have in fact been the first to discipline the deviation into a clear new style
    &#40;I might find out when I check out a 1888 Dickinson specimen book at UCLA&#41;.
    Plus in this case I think it&#39;s not right to favor Carter anyway, since it
    seems de Groot did it first &#40;among living designers&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; Back
    around 1800. In fact, he &#40;or maybe Bell&#41; also deserves credit for the
    3/4 lining numerals, which I also like. There seems to have been a lot of numeral
    innovation in the Highlands, for some reason. <BR> <BR>So what I&#39;m leaning
    towards is calling them Phemister, since Scottish is too broad: I&#39;d like to
    be able to refer to &#34;Bell numerals&#34; &#40;3/4 lining&#41; and &#34;Austin
    numerals&#34; as well &#40;like in Miller&#41;. But that&#39;s assuming Austin
    didn&#39;t make the first true hybrids as well! More research required... <BR>
    <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; Notice dates in Hrant&#39;s showing. <BR> <BR>You mean that
    they predate Goudy? <BR>The absoute latest that font could be is 1902, but it&#39;s
    probably 2-3 decades earler. <BR> <BR>The Forum numerals are interesting, and
    seem very similar to the ones in ATF Garamond &#40;which did however come a bit
    later&#41;, in that they&#39;re a very extreme case of hybrids, almost lining.
    BTW, I seem to remember Kent pointing out a precedent to the ATF Garamond numerals
    from around 1900, but I&#39;m not sure. <BR> <BR>&#62; <a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/Bodoni-Roman.html"

    that vertical arrangement is better than our conventional one, which is too low

    without such balance, illustrated by Hrant&#39;s showing. <BR> <BR>I am a little
    confused though. First, Hrant you say that your showing is the earliest you have
    found, but now indicate there were earlier experiments across the great pond.
    Are the earlier ones consistent with the #19 of the Phelps, Dalton &amp; Co? <BR>
    <BR>That question aside, I am not sure what they should be named. They are not
    French Oldstyle, they are too lining to be oldstyle and too oldstyle to be lining.
    Perhaps <i>old lining figs</i> would do. Tempting as it may be, naming such things
    after either location, foundry or designer can be a misleading. <BR> <BR>Unless

    <BR> <BR>&#62; old lining figs <BR> <BR>That&#39;s an interesting angle... but

    If I find proof that Phemister made that #19 &#40;noting that he was both punchcutter
    and designer&#42; for most of his career, certainly after 1872 when he got promoted
    to full partner at Phelps&#41;, and I don&#39;t see anything like that in Austin&#39;s

  body: Is my face red. Thank you for setting me straight on the terminology, but
    you can see why I was confused; in most conversations &#34;lining&#34; would seem
    to be shorthand for lining tabular, and &#34;oldstyle&#34; would seem to be shorthand
    for oldstyle proportional. I was under the impression that no one had ever yet
    considered that lining and tabular could be separated, hence my pet peeve. My
    hand has been out of typography for a long time, and I&#39;m mostly exposed to
    the &#34;defaults&#34; of the masses, in which lining tabular figures are often

    that Kent had once pointed out. In it &#40;vII, p230-1&#41; Updike says that one
    Hunter introduced lining figures in 1785, but then shows what he calls &#34;transitional&#34;
    figures that look like hybrids, except you can&#39;t be sure because there&#39;s
    no lc to compare to. The thing is, his &#34;transitional figures&#34; look very
    much like the Miller &#40;Scotch&#41; ones, except those weren&#39;t made before
    the Hunter innovation &#40;as far as I can tell&#41;, so how can they &#34;transition&#34;?
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Kevin, actually some people use &#34;lining&#34; to mean
    fixed-width &#40;probably because such figures do enable <i>vertical</i> alignment
    across subsequent lines&#41;. BTW, it is interesting that the numerals in that
    #19 seem to be fixed-width. I don&#39;t remember seeing that in [early] hybrids
    - it seems to be an influence of lining figures &#40;although oldstyles are actually
    easier to make fixed-width&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: '&#39;Scotch figures&#39; may be confusing to many people, since there is
    already a Scotch classification of type, many examples of which do <i>not</i>
    include this kind of figure. <BR> <BR>I think having what amount to nicknames
    for different figure styles is fine, but we should first have an accurate way
    to describe figures. The most important distinction to this discussion is that
    between lining and ranging figures. The term &#39;lining figures&#39; is used
    so commonly for cap-height figures that we tend to forget that it is an abbreviation
    for &#39;cap-height lining figures&#39;, i.e. of figures that are a common height,
    aligned to the caps. It is perfectly possible to have lining figures that align
    to other heights, e.g. to smallcap height, even to x-height and, in the case of
    Bell&#39;s famous figures, &#39;three-quarter cap height lining figures&#39; &#40;commonly
    called simply &#39;three-quarter figures&#39; -- again, an abbreviation&#41;.
    Just as the term &#39;lining&#39; does not by itself imply anything about the
    height of the figures -- other than that it is common --, so the term &#39;ranging&#39;
    doesn&#39;t necessarily imply oldstyle figures, i.e. figures that range above
    and below a median defined by the x-height. It is perfectly feasible to have ranging
    figures that range above and below a median defined by the smallcap height, or
    even the cap height, although the latter would look very odd. From this it should
    follow pretty obviously that what we&#39;re talking about in this thread, precisely,
    are <i>three-quarter cap-height ranging figures.</i> Anything else is simply a
    nickname &#40;of which there might be many: Scotch, Phemister, Boston, etc.&#41;
    or an abbreviation &#40;three-quarter ranging figs&#41;. <BR> <BR> <BR>NB: using
    &#39;lining&#39; to mean fixed-width is simply <i>wrong</i>. Lining and ranging
    describe vertical characteristics of figures; proportional and tabular describe
    horizontal characteristics. The truth of this is obvious as soon as one sits down
    to design typefaces with multiple figure styles: cap-height lining proportional,
    cap-height lining tabular, x-height ranging &#40;oldstyle&#41; proportional, x-height
    ranging&#40;oldstyle&#41; tabular, smallcap-height lining proportional, smallcap-height
    lining tabular, etc.'

    actually make hybrids.\r\n\r\nThe digital version of Plantin seems to have full
    lining nums,\r\nand I don't have any of my metal typeface specimen books\r\nhandy.
    Do you have a link/sample?\r\n\r\nPerpetua: The Italic does indeed have nice hybrids,
    but the\r\nRoman's nums are actually <em>shorter</em> than the x-height! Which
    is\r\nquite strange. In any case Gill was indeed a numeral innovator;\r\nthe tall
    \"2\" in Perpetua's Roman and Joanna is something we\r\nshould all be doing frankly.
    Although the French <em>were</em> ahead of\r\neverybody in terms of OS nums (until
    they took a break from text\r\nfonts for a while* and when they resumed they picked
    up some\r\nnasty Anglo habits).\r\n\r\n* \"Thanks\" to Charles Peignot.\r\n\r\nPreface:
    those nums are barely a hair taller than the x-height.\r\nI've seen that done
    before, but I've never understood it. Being\r\na typeface designer I would notice
    it and believe it's intentional,\r\nbut how could it appear as anything but a
    \"mistake\" to laymen?\r\nIsn't it a sort of golden rule of visual design to either
    deviate\r\nclearly or not at all? (Which is not to say that rules shouldn't\r\nbe
    broken - to me it does need to make sense though.)\r\n\r\nSo, how long did it
    take you to find ~1.5 examples of\r\nearly hybrid numerals? :-)  BTW, the #19
