  an anthology concerning the master piece or masterwork (which an apprentice had
  to make to be allowed in to a guild), and I want to give it a bit of a 1400's feel.
  I would like to have some suggestions for typefaces that breathe that era. I'm thinking
  Jenson / Aldus / Elzevir books here.\r\n\r\nThere are some great typefaces in that
  style, like Jannon from StormType and also Dos Santos' new Capsa. But I would like
  to have a few alternatives. It's not really important that it is a true revival.
  Types that are inspired by them are also welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    look at some of Ted Staunton's designs for [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search[text]=Sherwood+Type|Sherwood
    Type Foundry]]. He bases a lot of his work on old type designs, or handwriting,
    and some of them would certainly give an antique air to poetry settings.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Both Requiem and Augustin are excellent suggestions. I think they could both
    work, especially Requiem (and it's cheap?!). I think we might have Requiem at
    work, so I can hopefully make a few test settings tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe Sherwood
    types look nice, but I think a bit too quirky for this book.\r\n\r\nIf someone
    has more suggestions, they are certainly welcome."
