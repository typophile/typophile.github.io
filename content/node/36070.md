body: "Basic question I just can't figure out -- the image below is part of a web
  page. I want the home, about and contact buttons to be rollover images that have
  a transparent background. Of course, a transparent gif has that ugly white line.
  This page will have a flash gallery on it. Is the only solution is to make the whole
  page a flash page? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gallery_6486.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSharon"

    library called \"IE 7\". Nice thing about it, with it you can code properly CSS
    2.0 (CSS 2.1?) for all standard compliant browsers and via conditional comments
    you can solve nearly all problems for IE with it (transparency, box-model bugs,
    attribute selectors \u2026)\r\n\r\nThere is a quite simple javascript to solve
    this transparency problem for IE, too. Search the web for \"IE transparency image\".
    \r\n\r\nI use transparent png-24 format instead of gif. "

    Try searching for something like "pngfix.js".

  body: "A gif does not have to have \"that ugly white line\" around it. If you set
    the matte to black when saving the gif, then the antialiasing will blend to black,
    and not to white. you will still have a blackish border around it where the background
    is lighter than black but this will be better. You might even find a darker gray
    that works.\r\n\r\nBut why limit yourself to GIF. Slice up a JPG and make the
    rollover from that. If you position things correctly the background of the jpg
    will line up with the image behind, and transparency is not needed."

  body: "PNGs work in IE if you use one of the many 'IE PNG fixes'. Google \"Twin
    Helix IE PNG fix\" for a decent one. IE7 (as mentioned) works as well.\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't use JPGs for this. JPGs will never match the background color perfectly
    and tend to add artifacting to areas of high contrast (namly type). A gif will
    work fine.\r\n"
