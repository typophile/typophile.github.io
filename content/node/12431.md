body: "i have 252 fontlab files that i need to publish, each to two formats: mac truetype,
  and pc truetype.\r\n\r\nthat's a lot of drop down menus and dialog boxes to navigate.\r\n\r\ndoes
  anyone know of a python script or other similar solution that would allow me to
  designate the output format (in this case, mac tt and pc tt), the source folder,
  and the output folder, and press \"play\"?\r\n\r\nif there is no current solution
  for this, can anyone recommend a python/apple script guru who might be interested
  in developing the script?\r\n\r\ni'm on mac os 10.4 with fontlab 4.6.\r\n\r\neagerly
  awaiting fontlab 5.0 too.\r\n\r\n-tyler\r\n\r\n\r\nah, just got word from adam via
  the fontlab network that the transform tool covers this functionality within fontlab.\r\n\r\nthanks
  adam!"
