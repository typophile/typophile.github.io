  body: "Lettering. Note different widths of u in main title. In the line below the
    scale is small but one still spot differences. e.g. lower case s in Closerie &
    Lilas.\r\nBut there could well be digital fonts that are reasonably close to the
    various Art Nouveau lettering styles in the poster.\r\nDon"

  body: I do like the "reverse rotalic" (ie. oblique in construction but not in orientation)
    at the bottom. Any typefaces like that people know of?
