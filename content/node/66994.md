body: "Dunwich Type Founders is proud to announce our latest release, Armitage.\r\n\r\nSturdy
  and humane, Armitage renders type with vintage American warmth. Even with a subtle
  sparkle Armitage stays humble to let words work.\r\n\r\nRather than build on recent
  trends, Armitage starts over, derived from designs of the late nineteenth century.
  Designer James Puckett cast a wide net for source material. Letters from sign manuals,
  inscriptions, period posters, and architecture inspired Armitage as they inspired
  the designers of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nArmitage\u2019s asymmetrical strokes
  and subtle flares prevent monotony by rolling with the cadence of language. Six
  weights and italics make Armitage suitable for a wide range of tasks. Sturdy features
  stand up to adversity. With a strong jaw clenched in a grin, Armitage is always
  ready to work.\r\n\r\nArmitage is dedicated to Punchcut!, who do us the favor of
  hosting Typophile, and to the current and former board members of the Society of
  Typographic Aficionados, who make Typecon happen. I must also acknowledge the scholarship
  of James Mosely. James\u2019 essay <em>The Nymph and the Grot</em>, and the accompanying
  illustrations had a powerful influence on the design of Armitage.\r\n\r\nWeb use
  licenses are available from Fontspring. Students, teachers, and individuals can
  purchase discounted personal use licenses from MyFonts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://dunwichtype.com/pdfs/DTF_Armitage_Specimen.pdf\">Click

    Armitage page - like the fonts are on some kind of anti-sale:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_3691.gif]\r\n(On
    the \"buying choices\" page the prices look normal.)"

  body: "I HAVE NOTICED THIS TYPE, HOWEVER I THINK ITS A PITY THE CARACTERS ANRE'T
    \"NORMAL\" I SEE WHY YOU DRAW FUNNY LETTERS NOT RIGHT AS THERE ARE HEAPS OF THEM
    ON THE MARKET ALREADY. SAD. BUT I'M SURE, YOU COME UP WITH AN OTHER GREAT DRAWN
    TYPE IN THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\nTHE CARTACTERS ARE NOT REALLY SHARP. MAYBE NOT A GOOD
    AMOUNT OF TIME SPEANT ON TALENT. LOOK AT FRUTIGER OR SYNTAX, BEST FONTS MATE,
    WELL DRAWN. ARMYTAG GENERALLY NEEDS MORE WORK, ITALICS ARE NOT NECESSARY. MANY
    CRY WHEN DISCOVERED THEY WORK ON FONTS FOR LONG TIME AND TURN OUT TOO BE SH*T.
    HOPE YOU NOT ONE OF THOSE.\r\n\r\nTHERE A SO MANY SANS SERIF THIS DAYS, A NEW
    ONE HAVE TO BE VERY SPEACIAL.\r\nYOU MIGHT SAY YOURS IS SPEACIAL, BUT PEOPLE LAUGH
    BECAUSE THEY THINK SPEACIAL NEEDS FONT.\r\n\r\nGOOD ON YOU MATE AND GETTIN' BEHIND.\r\n\r\nH."

    and italics need a lot of work still; there seems to be no optical compensation

    positive. Good work."

    started as a design based on wonky Victorian square capitals that appear on apartment
    buildings from the late nineteenth century. When that went nowhere I used the
    proportions as the basis for a font based on letters from an 1812 lettering manual
    that James Mosley showed in <em>The Nymph and the Grot</em>. Other bits and pieces
    came from Victorian posters and random old letters scattered around the USA. I\u2019m
    working on an essay about it that will appear on ILT. "

    report published in 1870, Shinn has produced sleekly refined, micro-detailed vector
