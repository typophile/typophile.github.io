  body: "The name of the typeface is on the image, at the very top:\r\n\r\nLa Longue\r\nLight
    and Regular\r\n\r\nIt appears to be the work of Studio Julia (http://about-julia.com/en/),
    according to some blogs that feature the image, but I couldn't find the image
    or the typeface on their site. Probably not commercially available, but you might
    ask them directly...."
