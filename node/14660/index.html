		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sadly, there hasn&rsquo;t been a lot of good research into which typefaces and sizes are best for low vision. However, the research that does exist suggests that type size and text design choices are more critical than the typeface choice. Considering issues of colour contrast, line length, leading, and —because this is an exhibition— placement of text in the environment will make a larger difference to a reader than choosing Plantin over Minion.</p>
<p>Granted, one should use a reasonable typeface for the job. Here the research that is available suggests choosing a typeface that is well spaced and on the slightly heavier side. The ADA and SEGD guidelines can help here to weed out typefaces that are too light. Doing some informal user testing will also help, especially when choosing a type-size and colour combinations.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of good studies to recommend on this subject: I&rsquo;ve looked at a lot of the research (I can give you my bibliography if you&rsquo;re interested) and have concluded that a lot more research needs to be done, especially research geared to giving good guidelines to working designers.</p>
<p>I can suggest reading Alison Shaw&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Print for partial sight<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is getting dated, but it is the best study of typeface and type size for low vision. This isn&rsquo;t to say that it is perfect, but it is the most comprehensive study to date. You could also look at the research of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Minnesota Laboratory for Low-Vision Research<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It&rsquo;s some of the best work being done currently, but it is aimed at optometrists. Lastly, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zoe L. Strickler<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has done some interesting research (published in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Visible Language<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) in designing interactive systems for older adults and low vision. Though it is about interaction design, it does say a lot about design in general for low vision and older adults.</p>
<p>Hope that helps, and isn&rsquo;t too much.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think &ldquo;low-vision&rdquo; and visual acuity of aging adults (ouch!) are issues that can be clearly (ouch again) addressed with research and studies related to type sizes and letterform, as you are involved with.</p>
<p>I believe your mention of learning disabilities (inclusive of dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, and visual processing  disorder) involves a completely different area of research not fully dependent on character recognition itself.</p>
<p>By no means do I understand the issues related to such disorders, but one of my business partners is heavily involved with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Edvocacy.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to establishing a national early recognition program for children with dyslexia. (Visit the link and take the little decoding test to give you a sense of what dyslexic readers go through.)</p>
<p>My wife also happens to work for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Landmark School<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is one of the best known private educational facilities for children with reading and learning disorders. Of what I know of their mission is that they are training the students to decode and reprocess information encountered in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Through my wife, I have recently contacted Landmark to see if I could participate in or contribute to the school&rsquo;s art program (all of their teachers are required to have Masters in Special Education). I have been toying with the idea of letterform collages, innovative calligraphy and found object alphabets (inspired by both Nick Shinn and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clotilde Olyff<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). In that way it would just be the joy of shapes and recognized individual forms as art, and not for reading comprehension.</p>
<p>So many ideas, so little time&hellip; (at least another 50 years I hope).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello everyone:</p>
<p>I am also interested in finding out a bit more on this subject, more specifically about typefaces for older adults (seniors 65+). Which are more appropriate? What sizes? How much leading? Column width?&hellip; These are some of the questions that are arising&hellip;</p>
<p>After a somewhat extensive search online, I couldn&rsquo;t find any relevant information, or resources&hellip; I mean, from the type design perspective&hellip;</p>
<p>Tiresias (<a href="http://www.tiresias.org/">http://www.tiresias.org/</a>) and APH (<a href="http://www.aph.org/">http://www.aph.org/</a>) both have typefaces they say are appropriate for low vision readers, but I find the overall quality pretty doubtful. Also, I don&rsquo;t know who their designers were, and I haven&rsquo;t seen any credible results published&hellip;</p>
<p>W3C (<a href="http://www.w3.org/)">http://www.w3.org/)</a>, AARP (<a href="http://www.aarp.org/">http://www.aarp.org/</a>) and AGElight (<a href="http://www.agelight.com/">http://www.agelight.com/</a>) have all published some guidelines, but only agree on the use of sans serif typefaces, from ~12 pt upwards&hellip;</p>
<p>Irene Strizver (2004) also recommends some type settings, but doesn&rsquo;t provide any definitive answer.</p>
<p>Can someone help me find more information, or fonts with enough documentation on this?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s great! Size is a huge thing to all your reading groups.</p>
<p>And Clearview is a great choice for road signage, (your link is broken JM?) but these reading groups are not any different from &ldquo;normal&rdquo; people in that the typeface choice should compliment the topic of the content, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->perhaps within narrower bounds than a normal reading group<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but the selection should not be entirely based on either &ldquo;readability&rdquo; or .gov, IMHO.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David:</p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t know which or how to apply the &ldquo;large format&rdquo; factors&hellip; It seems to me that common sense and much testing is needed. But how to do it?.</p>
<p>For seniors (older adults) current recommendations vary&hellip; The common denominator seems to be to recommend the use sans serif typefaces in large sizes (e.g.: type for reading on screen ~14pt).  I can&rsquo;t imagine what to do in large format graphic panels (and here ADA can provide some guidelines). Although it seems to contradict the maxim of &ldquo;we read best what we read more&rdquo;, I think the sans serif recommendation is due to the fact that sans serif typefaces may help increase the white space and avoid unnecessary visual clutter (without dismissing the serifs' function, though).</p>
<p>Although older adults aren&rsquo;t necessarily people with disabilities, low vision, speed of reading and cognition problems come with age (and yes&hellip; many of us will suffer from most of these!):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And it&rsquo;s not exclusive to US Older Adults. It&rsquo;s more or less the same everywhere.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find much information on the Clearview Typeface specification/reports/Designer(s) (other than Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearview_%28typeface%29)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearview_%28typeface%29)</a>, but I found an interesting read on Chpater 7 of ADA&rsquo;s 2010 Specifications: <a href="http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAStandards.pdf">http://www.ada.gov/regs2010/2010ADAStandards/2010ADAStandards.pdf</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ok. Once again, sans serif is the type selection of choice.</p>
<p>Although I find hard to agree, ADA even provides character proportions, body size, line height and different spacing settings. but wait a second&hellip; uppercase characters? And doesn&rsquo;t different character drawings of structure/stroke/modulation/contrast imply different settings?&hellip;</p>
<p>This is all starting to look like a huge mess to me&hellip; So I agree with you&hellip; Maybe the .gov is &ldquo;too narrow&rdquo; of a selection for a more general purpose group&hellip; Maybe we should try to evaluate what the readability and legibility is for each situation? How to do it?</p>
<p>BTW: Where can I find out more on Clearview?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Finally found some more information on Clearview Type System: <a href="http://clearviewhwy.com/ResearchAndDesign/researchWhitepapers.php">http://clearviewhwy.com/ResearchAndDesign/researchWhitepapers.php</a></p>
<p>It seems to have been designed by Donald Meeker and James Montalbano. Of the three typefaces I&rsquo;ve encountered, designed specifically for low vision conditions (Tiresias, APHont) and stress conditions (Clearview), this is the only one to have been designed by professional Designers and improved/finished by a Type Designer, and to have been properly (and scientifically?) tested.</p>
<p>There is no information about the Tiresias typefaces' designer, and the development team claims to have tested the Tiresias Typeface.  But they only provide (an useful) checklist: <a href="http://www.tiresias.org/research/guidelines/checklists/fonts_checklist.htm">http://www.tiresias.org/research/guidelines/checklists/fonts_checklist.htm</a>. Neverthless, I can&rsquo;t seem to find any published results.</p>
<p>As with Russel-Minda et al. (<a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6836/is_7_101/ai_n28446295/pg_8/">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6836/is_7_101/ai_n28446295/pg_8/</a>) I couldn&rsquo;t find any published results for APHont&rsquo;s use, although they do publish some guidelines online&hellip; Once again, no information about the designer&hellip;</p>
<p>It seems that legibility (and readability) is still a very confusing and an ill documented area of Graphic and Type Design. Especially regarding user testing&hellip; Most of the more interesting papers published (at least regarding the testing methodology) are from people who really don&rsquo;t seem to have a clue about well designed type shapes.</p>
<p>I encourage you to take a look at one of the most relevant (?) authors I found as an example: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16099015">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16099015</a>.</p>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s like E. B. Huey said, back in 1908:
&ldquo;And so to completely analyze what we do when we read would almost be the acme of a psychologist&rsquo;s achievements, for it would be to describe very many of the most intricate workings of the human mind, as well as to unravel the tangled story of the most remarkable specific performance that civilization has learned in all its history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a good number of years now we&rsquo;ve had a highly qualified research psychologist working for a filthy-rich corporation that actually seems to care about reading, but we&rsquo;re still largely in the dark.</p>

<p>But then all you&rsquo;re doing is further entrenching the status quo (which too often is based on other people&rsquo;s -often bad- taste). Although it&rsquo;s not enough by itself, science can play a role in anything (even mixing paint for abstract art). And it&rsquo;s great at dispelling intuitive assumptions like &ldquo;the type should be large&rdquo;; there are many flavors of &ldquo;low-vision&rdquo; and one needs to learn the science behind them to be a good designer.</p>
<p>Science is not about universities or lab equipment. Science is about an attitude - an attitude central to Design.</p>

Thank you for the references and your input on this. I can really relate to it!&hellip; I&rsquo;ve already added your website to my reading list ;)
——</p>
<p>Nick:
Let me agree and disagree. When you have a design brief, sure you have to make and educated, aesthetic-based decision. We do it all the time. We evaluate the client and research the target audience, we evaluate and research the contents and we prototype the design.  We can even test the result sometimes. I&rsquo;m with Hrant this time: sure this is not a laboratory, but this uses a very similar process, don&rsquo;t you agree?</p>
<p>Many, many factors taken into account in this process are also some kind of science. You know that choosing a typeface will change the reading speed, the white space, the copy structure/hierarchy, etc&hellip; If you do it more intuitively, or more scientifically&hellip; well I thinks its up to each one of us.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree more!  See below my first attempt to try to compile a recommendation list.</p>
<p>——
About these papers/researches, I keep struggling with some things like the methods and results they provide. Some are really contradictory to my experience/design education. For example, quoting the abstract from Psychophysics of Reading:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With this, they cant test vision acuity (AKA legibility?) regarding the selected typeface (no doubt here). But they provide reading speed results&hellip; also with a MNREAD chart? Of course they found something we already know for users with normal vision:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My problem with these is that they fail to present the samples used for testing. This is a matter also raised by Albert Jan-Pool at ATypI in Dublin during one presentation.</p>
<p>And, whenever they provide them, the testing materials are poorly designed. No wonder the results are what they are&hellip; remember this one: <a href="http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Diemand-Yauman_Oppenheimer_2010.pdf">http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Diemand-Yauman_Oppenheimer_2010.pdf</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let me try to compile a starters list with the recommendations based on the literature below (for seniors/older adults):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The problem is that this is an interdependent variable system&hellip; Some of these are really simple science/lab tested result based decisions (like 1a). Others&hellip; well&hellip;</p>
<p>——
Notes:</p>
<p>(*1) We know what is constitutes a legible typeface (see the literature here, or start with this one: <a href="http://www.aiga.org/typography-and-the-aging-eye/">http://www.aiga.org/typography-and-the-aging-eye/</a>. But what should we use and how to test the different selected options on a screen prototype? APHont, or Tiresias seem like viable candidates, but really, Verdana is a time tested, master designed typeface.</p>
<p>(*2) For print sizes, recommendations vary a bit, but seem to be between 12 and 14 pt for body size. On screen, what should we use?</p>
<p>(*3) Agelight proposes: &ldquo;It is suggested you leave a wide margin of 1 1⁄2 or more inches on the right side of the page to maximize usability with different monitor types, window sizes and display resolutions.&rdquo; 
It&rsquo;s a bit outdated&hellip;</p>
<p>(*4) Agelight proposes: &ldquo;Short pages, those containing one or two screens of text, work well for the homepage and menu pages when users are scanning for informational links. Longer pages, although they require more scrolling, may work well for destination pages where related content can be printed and read/scanned together. Avoid creating large pages with multiple articles and links. Break topics down into succinct pages for usability and printing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(*5) Agelight proposes: &ldquo;bright, fluorescence or vibrant can have edges that appear to blur and create after-images,which fatigue the eye [&hellip;] the safest colors to use are black, white, blue and yellow where as red, green brown, grey and purple can be troublesome.</p>
<p>(*6) From Agelight: &ldquo;Drop shadows on text, often used to give words the appearance of depth, can be difficult to decipher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(*7) Agelight &amp; Strizver recommend body size between 12 and 14 pt. Agelight recommends titles two points larger, but I disagree. Type should be CLEARLY contrasting in size, using a rule of thumb to have a 4 pt difference step, or a 10-20% difference in size (depending on typeface and body selected).</p>
<p>(*8) From Agelight: &ldquo;Limiting the use of bold to emphasize a title or a key word is recommended.&rdquo;. Condensed / expanded are also not recommendable. Strivzer also adds: &ldquo;Use boldface to emphasize a word or a small group of words. Keep use of italics to a minimum; research indicates that italic type is 18 percent more difficult to read than Roman (upright) letters.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">And another trick to help you in your lit-review is to start with a new article, preferably from a relevant journal with a high impact factor, go to its references section, and see what articles it references and go from there (back in time). Conversely, if you use Web of Science as your database of choice, there is a link on bottom to create forward and backward citation maps (which tend to be somewhat flaky) and a “times cited” link at the top of the article which will give you a complete list of all articles that have cited the one you are looking at since its time of publication (forward in time).

<p>Certainly, if you’re designing for special needs readers, it helps to know something about those needs, which can be quite varied.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I consider the marketplace to be an empirical proving ground for what is functional. It’s true, as Hrant points out, that a lot of garbage gets foisted on the public, but ultimately people will read what works best for them, and publishers facilitate that or they are out of business—although well-meaning governments can provide a bad skew by ﬁnancing wishful thinking.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Pedro, I put it to you that even your most basic “scientiﬁcally-proven” precept is incorrect. Do you really think that the Old Nicks of this world (of whom I am one) will take kindly to reading books set in sans serif, when we have been reading them set in serifed fonts all our lives? I’m not familiar with libararies in Portugal, but those I have been into elsewhere have large print sections where all the books are set in classic serifed faces. Doesn’t this suggest there is some merit in the practice?</p>
<p>What happens when you age is that you have to view the text from further away, because you can no longer focus as close as you once could. This reduces type size to below the optimum arc of vision, therefore it needs to be bigger to compensate. It’s that simple! Many people slide their glasses down their nose to bring the type into focus (it’s human nature to “make do” rather than get new glasses)—but that makes the type smaller, again, not enough arc of vision.</p>
<p>There is also some loss of contrast due to yellowing of the lens.</p>
<p>I’m talking about the normal deterioration of vision brought about by aging.</p>

<p>People will read the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->content<!-- raw HTML omitted --> they either <!-- raw HTML omitted -->want<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->have<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to read. The degree of motivation is inversely proportional to how good the typography needs to be to enable the completion of the reading task.

<p>more specifically about typefaces for older adults 
(seniors 65+). Which are more appropriate? What sizes?</p>

<p>Seems to me that you&rsquo;re lumping together a very broad range of users. Vision obviously changes as we get older, but it&rsquo;s still extremely variable. My 90-year-old mother still reads standard books and magazines without difficulty, but she has a friend in her 70s with macular degeneration who is almost blind. There&rsquo;s not going to be a point size recommendation that&rsquo;s appropriate for everyone over 65.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for research in this area, although I think many of the findings are largely common sense (use an easy-to-read font, bump up the point size, etc.).</p>
<p>Not sure if this will be of any help to you, but some computer companies may have done some research on readability on monitors for folks with disabilities. For example, Apple has a page discussing some special computer settings for users with poor eyesight. Not a lot of info, but it&rsquo;s interesting that they have settings for making the screen high contrast and the option to reverse black and white. (I&rsquo;m not even sure why reversed type would be easier for some with impaired vision to read, but apparently it is in some cases.)

<p>A fair question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the one that&rsquo;s the easiest to defend.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> bold.</p>
<p>For printing to be legible at the lowest possible optical resolution, you have to maximize the total information content relative to feature size.</p>
<p>Which leads to the conclusion that, on average, approximately 50% of the paper should be covered by ink.</p>
<p>Bulging stems, flared corners, otherwise weird-looking?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming this font, to be usable for people with a severe visual impairment, is going to be designed so that it would be legible to people with normal vision <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in a two-point size<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m envisaging that somehow it is going to be designed to compensate for being blurred. The techniques I&rsquo;m thinking of are similar to ones used in the design of masks for the photolithography of integrated circuits so that features appear to be neater and more rectangular than seems to be possible given diffraction-limited resolution of the wavelength of light used.</p>

informaton ≠ ink
Most often than not, bold is less legible than regular. Especially at low resolution.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m aware of that. The term &ldquo;low vision&rdquo; has a specific meaning, and I have taken it to refer to people with so profoundly impared vision that it is no longer practical to concern oneself with readability, and even achieving legibility will require every resource at our command.</p>
<p>@riccard0:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->informaton ≠ ink<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Yes. You&rsquo;ll note I said 50% and not, say, 80%.</p>
<p>The information content of a page at any given level of maximum resolution, assuming only the two colors of black and white may be used, indeed does reach a maximum when ink coverage is at 50%.</p>
<p>This is basically for the same reason that if you have identical checkers of two colors, and you arrange them in a row, there are more possible arrangements of nine red checkers and nine black checkers than there are of six red checkers and twelve black checkers.</p>
<p>Information does not equal ink. In this context, it equals the difference between where the ink is and where the ink is not.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Quadibloc, for explaining your thinking. I appreciate that you took my question in the spirit it was intended.  :)</p>
<p>I expect that for the extreme end of low vision, the ideal choices are different than they are for the majority of low vision cases. It&rsquo;s also an important question as to whether the text in question will <em>also</em> be read by others, or only by the vison-impaired or massively vision-impaired.</p>

<p>A friend of mine went virtually blind from macular degeneration. In the early stages she could get by with large-type books, magnifying lenses, etc., but after a certain point it became impractical and started using books on tape or asking a relative to read to her.</p>
