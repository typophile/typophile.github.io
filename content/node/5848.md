  body: Metadox -- you were correct with Marker Felt -- just that it&#39;s Marker
    Felt Light.

  body: Anyone know the real origin of Marker Felt? It&#39;s now supplied with Mac
    OS X, but the versions digitized by Dieter Steffman and various shareware/freeware
    designers are different. The &#34;Marker Felt Thin-Plain Regular&#34; face on
    <a href="http://www.searchfreefonts.com/fonts/m5.htm">this page</a> seems to match
    the &#34;a&#34; in the sample, but I don&#39;t know if this is an approved version
    of the font as far as Typophile is concerned.

  body: 'Metadox. I can answer your question about the creator of the <BR>Marker Felt
    fonts. That was Pat Snyder &#40;who correctly shows <BR>up in the copyright of
    the font you linked to in your last post&#41;. <BR>I registered my copies of various
    of his fonts long ago. <BR> <BR>Mr. Snyder used to have a Web page, but that disappeared
    <BR>years ago. All efforts of mine to find and contact him again <BR>a few months
    ago failed. <BR> <BR>The fonts were originally &#40;no surprise&#41; for the Mac
    and can <BR>be found <a href="http://www.erik.co.uk/font/arty.html" target="_blank">
    here</a>, complete with documentation. Mac folk: See <BR>his nifty SnyderSpeed
    font as well. Marker Felt Wide and <BR>Marker Fine Point for Windows may be found
    <a href="http://www.filelibrary.com/Contents/Multi-Platform/100/33.html" target="_blank">
    here</a> &#40;file <BR>names begin with mf&#41; with docs. <BR> <BR>This <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/fonts/"
    target="_blank"> Apple web page</a> gives credit to Pat Snyder. I hope that <BR>they
    gave him some cash too. <BR><br>'

  body: Thanks for that info, Mike. So it looks like Pat Snyder designed the font
    circa 1992 and then Dieter Steffman filled out the character set in 2001, at least
    for the normal weight &#40;don&#39;t know if he got permission from Snyder&#41;,
    then Apple licensed the normal weight for OS X.
