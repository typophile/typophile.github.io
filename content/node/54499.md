  font and since I don't want them to come on by default I'm putting them in the Discretionary
  Ligature feature.\r\n\r\nWhen I compiled them they came in, but this feature seems
  to ignore the glyph order. For instance if I put T_T before E_T in the feature code
  and type E T T it still renders E_T first. Is there any way around this? I take
  it that dlig doesn't function like the standard liga."

  body: "You need to use two lookups: \r\n\r\n<code>feature dlig { \r\n  lookup dlig1
    { \r\n    sub T T by T_T;\r\n  } dlig1; \r\n  lookup dlig2 { \r\n    sub E T by
    E_T;\r\n  } dlig2; \r\n} dlig;</code>\r\n\r\nWith each pass of the text, one lookup
    is executed. \r\n\r\nWithin one pass, the layout engine tries to match all the
    substitution rules within that lookup against the current text, one glyph after
    another. Whenever a match occurs, the substitution rule is executed. So if you
    put both the E_T and T_T rules in one lookup, the E_T rule will be the best match
    in the first pass (in the glyph string E T T), and it will be executed (so the
    result is the glyph string E_T T). \r\n\r\nBut with multiple lookups, they are
    executed in consecutive passes on the full glyph run (typically one line of text),
    and the output of one lookup becomes the input of the next one. So if you define
    the substitutions in two lookups as shown above, with the T_T rule being first,
    the first pass will substitute E E T with E T_T, and then the second lookup will
    have nothing to match. \r\n\r\nIf you don't define lookups explicitly in the <a
    href=\"http://forum.fontlab.com/adobe/afdko/\">AFDKO</a> / FontLab Studio syntax,
    one lookup per feature definition is implicitly created, and each feature definition
    gets a separate lookup (so while you reorder the feature definitions in FontLab
    Studio's OpenType panel, you are in fact changing the order of lookups in the
    font). \r\n\r\nIn <a href=\"http://forum.fontlab.com/adobe/afdko/\">Adobe FDK
    for OpenType (AFDKO) version 2.5</a>, which will also be part of FontLab Studio
    6, it is possible to define lookups outside of feature definitions, which allows
    creating more complex scenarios useful in feature cross-interaction. If two features
    are active at the same time, your code might then execute the first lookup of
    the feature A, then feed the output into the first lookup of the feature B, and
    then feed the output into the second lookup of the feature A. This is currently
    not possible in FontLab Studio 5. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n\r\nPs. No, I don't have any
    specific release details for FontLab Studio 6 to announce yet :)"
