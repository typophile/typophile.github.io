  Legible\" by [[Rolf F. Rehe]]. After a search for Mr. Rehe's name on Typophile,
  I was surprised to find that he's never been mentioned here. Is this because there's
  an understanding amongst specialists in legibility that this guy is outdated (the
  book was published in 1972, updated in 1976), or have I happened upon some rarity
  in the Chicago Public Library?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nMy second guess is Mr. Rehe's
  research, a compilation of findings from psychologists and legibility experts, has
  been made redundant or irrelevant by more updated and thorough documents like the
  ones mentioned in Paul Hunt's discussion at: [[http://typophile.com/node/41577]]\r\n\r\nEither
  way, I'll be paraphrasing his ideas in a Wiki, if I can figure out how to author
  one."

    so, it would have to have been quite recently, within the last few months. Rolf
    just wrote an interview with David Berlow in the Fall/Winter 2009 issue of <em>Design
    Journal</em>, a quarterly publication of the SND ([[http://www.snd.org|Society
    of News Design]]), of which I believe Rolf was a founding member. "

  body: Typo-L is a typography mailing list (pretty old school, eh?) so folk with
    an interest could communicate and share ideas. It is still running, though may
    not be as active as it once was.

    [not-completely-undeserved] snipe aside, both the Typo-L and Type Design e-mail
    lists were pretty active in the \"old days\" (ca. late 90s, early 00s) before
    internet forums took off. Rolf was active on both. Some of us regulars here migrated
    from there. Typophile forums and certain blogs pretty much supplanted the e-mail
    lists.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with Rolf's book, so I can't comment on its value."

    is not much respected in the graphic design community, perhaps because it's not
    something that any graphic design firms (other than a few specialists) or ad agencies
    do, or understand--for instance, they don't appreciate many of the typographic
    constraints of news pagination systems. But it is hugely important to the type
    industry, an important source of commissions to leading foundries--and mine. And
    it has some of the most sophisticated, most-read typography on the planet. So
    as a type critic who specializes in news design, Rolf Rehe's opinions carry a
    lot of weight."

    matter) not sure why i've been sniped here. Surely you didn't take \"type geeks\"
    as a derogatory comment? I am a newbie (to Typophile, not design) and frankly
    the snobbish attitude is unappreciated. I'm just an aspiring type designer who
    is trying to learn from those more established in the community. Or is that not
    the point of a forum by type geeks for type geeks? I don't quite see the point
    of snide comments here, as I was only hoping to contribute by initiating this
    thread. Hugs.\r\n\r\n<cite> >So as a type critic who specializes in news design,
    Rolf Rehe\u2019s opinions carry a lot of weight.\r\n\r\nThanks for the thoughtful
    response, Nick. His book seemed very well thought-out and deeply researched. From
    here on, I will follow his rules with the understanding that they may have been
    developed with news design in mind."

  body: "Paul -- \r\n\r\nI took Si's comment to be aimed at the Typo-L list itself,
    which IIRC deteriorated somewhat miserably at the end. I think I bailed in the
    middle of one particularly nasty squabble.\r\n\r\nI didn't think the snipe was
    targeted at you. And so, my reference (\"not-completely-undeserved\") was intended
    also at the memory of that list, not you. If my interpretation is indeed correct,
    it was quite an inside \"joke.\"\r\n\r\nRe-reading, I can see how you would take
    offense. Apologies for my unwitting part in any perceived insult. You're perfectly
    welcome here, as far as I'm concerned.\r\n\r\nI'll let Simon explain for himself.\r\n\r\n--
