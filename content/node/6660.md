body: 'Hello, all! I am not a type designer and my level of knowledge about fonts
  is relatively scant. I&#39;ve run into a question/problem that I have not been able
  to find an answer for, so I&#39;m here hoping you&#39;ll help. <BR> <BR>When designing
  fonts, I&#39;ve seen various geometric shapes &#40;circles, lines, curves, etc&#41;
  used to create the shape of the font. For example, notice the words &#34;Da Vinci&#34;
  in this image: <a href="http://www.keynotethemepark.com/content/pages/T3/davinci/davinci_01.jpg"

  <BR> <BR>What is this process called? Where can I find more information about it?
  My final goal is to perhaps locate a font that looks like this for a &#34;Roman
  Architecture&#34;-style website. <BR> <BR>Any hints or clues? <BR> <BR>Thanks in
  advance for any help offered. <BR> <BR>Peter <BR>Columbus, Ohio USA'

    proportional studies. Don&#39;t recall where I saw it though. Sorry.

    target="_blank">Codex</a> by Emerald City Fontwerks or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/roughwork/"
    target="_blank">Roughwork</a> from Scriptorium. <BR>It looks like Roughwork could
    be a match for your lettering example.

  body: 'They&#39;re sort of just called &#34;constructed&#34; fonts, although that
    also makes one think of the 20th century &#34;Soviet-style&#34; stuff, or the
    cut&amp;paste fad of the 90s. But if you&#39;re looking for a term for fonts that
    include the &#34;scaffolding&#34; so to speak in there, I don&#39;t know a term
    for that - probably because I know of only one such design: Agfa&#39;s Rubino.
    <BR> <BR>In terms of references, Matthew Carter has written one of the very few
    substantial articles about the topic: &#34;Theories of Letterform Construction&#34;,
    in issue #26-27 &#40;AKA Volume 13-#2 &amp; Volume 14-#1&#41; of the APHA Journal&#42;.
    That was &#34;Part 1&#34;, but unfortunately it looks like part 2 won&#39;t happen.
    Carter lists Pacioli, Durer and Tory as having tried their hand at geometrically
    constructed capitals. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.printinghistory.org/htm/journal/contents.html#26_27"
    target="_blank">http://www.printinghistory.org/htm/journal/contents.html#26_27</a>
    <BR> <BR>A harder reference to find is Oldrich Hlavsa&#39;s amazing &#34;A book
    of type and design&#34; of 1960. Part of it is dedicated to geometrically constructed
    alphabets, and besides Tory and Pacioli he covers Pierre le Be, Jean de Vingle,
    and Damiano da Moille. Besides that, Hlavsa&#39;s book contains many &#34;lost&#34;
    gems of type design as well, plus some interesting personal thoughts on type.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, I once bought a facsimile of Durer&#39;s &#34;Of the Just Shaping
    of Letters&#34; for $10, and it contains comprehensive sketches and full discussions
    of the whole A-Z, and even an attempt at geometrically constructing blackletter
    lowercase at the end. I just checked bookfinder.com and it looks like it&#39;s
    available for as low as $3.50. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    wanted the letters to be one color and the &#34;scaffolding&#34; &#40;as Hrant
    so eloquently put it&#41; to be a light grey color... from the look of your font,
    this will get me exactly what I need without having to invest as much time in
    editing. <BR> <BR>Also, the J, U and W letters are a bonus! Thanks and I&#39;m
    marking the days until the 25th.

    in the thread, Hrant.  <BR> <BR>Gotta read everything a bit closer... <BR>  <BR>&#62;
    <i>BTW, I think that was the first such type design, no?</i> <BR> <BR>Not sure
    about that. Perhaps the first digital version with that much detail. It&#39;s
    a pretty complex design, and used to choke Fontographer&#39;s TrueType generation...'
