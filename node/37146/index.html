  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am pretty dissatisfied with my current web host. I was wondering if anyone has a web host they'd recommend, and if there are any where you don't have to upload files individually. Are there any web hosting platforms where you can just select a folder and upload everything at once?

Thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">Most web hosts should be able to do that, if you have a halfway-decent FTP program for doing your file transfer work. If you don't mind me asking, who's your current host?

I use 1and1.com and they've worked well for me. Also have a site set up on a buddy's computer in Australia, and other than his occasional system troubles, never had problems there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I guess Media Temple is pretty good. I have a Dutch hoster myself, but a friend of mine uses Media Temple (and I believe Typophile was or is hosted there as well).

But I think you should be able to upload a whole dir on your current host too. However, with FTP, files are always uploaded one by one, until the whole dir is uploaded. But I'm probably stating the obvious. ;)</div>

As for 'upload multiple files at one'...as stated, FTP or SFTP access will provide that, and is a rather basic feature at any Web Host. I'm rather shocked that yours doesn't offer that. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's been a while since I've shopped around and compared what's out there, but I've been using [[http://www.webintellects.com/|WebIntellects]] for many years now and they've been reliable and reasonably priced. If you're looking for good helper apps and other enhancements, you might want to take a close look at what they have -- I don't use that stuff much. They have good Unix-based servers, and I use my own FTP client to move files back and forth. Their tech support has always been very responsive.</div>
