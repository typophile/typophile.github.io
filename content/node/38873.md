body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nA month ago I posted here concerning a logotype that I'm making.
  Thanks for your advice! I've devoloped a new one, but I'm not satisfied with it.
  Could you please help me develop a new one? Please take a look:\r\n\r\nhttp://img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/b90aee2697.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
  logotype is for my (small) advertising and PR firm. The company name is my last
  name (the one you see above).\r\n\r\nThere's one logotype that I really like. It's
  a fictional one, but it's really cool. \r\n\r\nhttp://img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/3383b76e87.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
  thing I like with the typography is that the Y is in the center of the word, and
  being wrapped by \"WA\" and \"NE\". Two letters on each side. The font is also well
  made. Unfortunately I can't use this technique as the name has seven letters.\r\n\r\nThe
  symbol is the best one I've seen so far. A \"W\" which is formed like a trident.
  The only symbol which have anything with the letter \"G\" I've found is the G-clef.
  But I don't  work with music so it's nothing for me.\r\n\r\n<strong>-----------------------------------</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  font I use now (Adobe Garamond Pro) is okay. But not good enough. Do you have any
  suggestion conerning font/space et.c.? Should I use capital letters instad?\r\n\r\nI've
  got no idea what I should use as a symbol. The one I use now is a bit childish.
  Please help me with this one, I've got no clue. I'm stuck on this one.\r\n\r\nI
  would prefer if the symbol reminds one of a \"G\" or something similar.\r\n\r\n<strong>-----------------------------------</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen
  writing in a design forum, I could take the opportunity to ask you about colors.
  I have experimented with colors, and 722A7E (C67/M100/Y14/K3) is the one color I
  like best. This is my profile color and I use it on my website too. Is it to aggressive?
  If so - which color do you think could fit \"my profile\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Thanks
  alot!</strong>"

    each side, one in the middle.\r\nYou could say that the 'i' makes it difficult
    to use the technique, though."

    to check if the \"D\" fits as the head letter."

  body: "Personally I kind of like the right one, two down and the left top one.\r\n\r\nThe
    left middle one is at home on an armored van, and the very top one makes me think
    of the \"GM Goodwrench\" logo.  For the third row, try lining up the bars to the
    edge of the square and see how that looks.\r\n\r\nTry one with the D hilighted,
    using maybe a sans with more squarish lettering so it looks overall symmetric.
    I don't actually have a font that matches what I'm thinking outside of pixel fonts,
    and that's not the right look either.\r\n\r\n"

    What do you think about the other one? More \"Genie\". Is it too unserious?\r\n\r\nhttp://img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/4973fe29db.jpg\r\n\r\nBTW:
    how do I show the picture without posting the link? IMG SRC doesn't seem to work."
