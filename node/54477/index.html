<p>A recent testimonial tells the story…</p>
<p>Hello all,
For Christmas I received the new book by Gregory Ruffa called &ldquo;The Art of Wood Type&rdquo; and it is simply amazing. Outstanding quality and photographs. It delves into so many aspects of manufacturing, collecting, displaying and printing with wood type. Interviews with wood type
historians..pantographs&hellip;typefaces&hellip; intellectual property and early font patents&hellip;U&amp;lc magazine&hellip; modern letterpress printers&hellip;etc. &amp; more. If you haven&rsquo;t ordered this book yet, look at a few pages from the web site listed below. Such a well done book. 330 glossy pages of wood type and typographical history.</p>
<p>It was $50 plus shipping. I think it&rsquo;s only available through his web site. <a href="http://www.theartofwoodtype.com/">www.theartofwoodtype.com/</a></p>
