body: "I'm about to take on a magazine redesign. The mag is printed on poor news stock
  in a tabloid format. I hope to turn the poor quality to my advantage, thus I'm looking
  for typefaces especially made for this kind of circumstances. I've been looking
  into newspaper type, but most are very conservative. Do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nUntil
  now they have used Bembo Book for text and The Mix for headlines/some text. In terms
  of text, I would love to use something a bit more soft, something along the lines
  of Feijoa or Dolly (but I'm not sure how well they'll hold up at text sizes). I
  love Dolly's italic! I've been looking at numerous different display fonts, and
  I'm guessing I need more than one. Something with a contemporary feel to it?\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions? Any examples of other magazines on poor stock?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

  body: The content is a mix of long articles and short blurbs on topics like culture,
    human interaction and creativity. Readers are mostly students.

  body: "Dolly obviously holds up fine at text sizes, as it has been designed as such.
    \r\nHow well it behaves on news stock I don't know, as it's mostly meant for books.\r\n\r\nHave
