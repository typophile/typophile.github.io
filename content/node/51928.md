body: 'Something that I was thinking about today - Elizabeth Hurley is one of my favourites
  for the main character in Stinging Filth and Bloody Hands.  She will make a fine
  ''Emily''. Spiteful, insensitive and very egotistical.  George Clooney should play
  her husband Michael. Warm, loving and at times neurotic.  Remember she is cheating
  on him with his best friend Jack.  Now who could play Jack the underworld businessman
  and vicious womaniser? How about someone like Hugh Jackman?  Rene, his sister-in-law,
  also a crminal but sadly abused and taunted by Jack, should be played by Kate Winslet.  Marissa,
  Jack''s deceased wife should be played by Scarlett Johanssen(her death was a mistake).  Now
  how the heck am I going to pay these people????????????????????   '

  body: I have written the most entertaining and exciting play for 2009.  Very unpredictable
    and a real page turner.  Move over other playwrights! Make way for 'Stinging Filth
    and Bloody Hands'. See for yourself www.astingingaffair.com.  Welcome to a new
    era.
