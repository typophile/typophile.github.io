  promotions company based in the UK. They are currently jazz-based but would like
  to branch out into other genres in the future. This logo must be used on stationery,
  web and be printed in small sizes (just the 'a8' ligature) on spines of CDs. \r\n\r\nLet
  me know what you think!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRich\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a8ligature_3568.jpg]"

  body: I like it. Very good. I might suggest widening the thin stroke of the bottom
    join a little. And nudge "music" a little to the left, because it doesn't look
    centered to me, at least in the unframed versions.

    about tho:\r\n\r\nLook at the negative space in the logo, you may have to correct
    the axes a bit especially at the top of the 8 and the a. All the axes should be
    completely vertical. Stroke smoothing in the lower part of a is necessary too.\r\n\r\nGood
    job!\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: Interesting use of fonts. - There must be a theory behind the characters used
    and a reason they are entwined - Consider alternate fonts for the word music they
    should give strength to and not distract from the theory/concept appearing above
    them. The current selection for music does not portray the seriousness of the
    logotype above it. Consider the maturity of the ligature and find a way to bring
    that maturity into the word music making them a stronger unit.  ---- versonova

    is another \"a8\"-ligature. Hope you find it interesting.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a8_4261.gif]"

  body: It looks nice, Bjorn, but that's not a ligature, because "ligature" -- from
    Latin "to be connected" -- is only when two or more letters get connected -- as
    opposed to "intertwined" or "melted" together.

  body: "very smart Rich! \r\n\r\nI've looked at it for 5 minutes and it's totally
    grown on me. if i cast my mind back 4 minutes and 50 seconds i'd have said that
    the 8 should be dropped down just slightly to give the vertical stroke of the
    \"a\" a chance to descend a touch further before becoming the bottom-most stroke
    of the 8. the \"a\" just looked a little disempowered to me at first. \r\n\r\nbut
    that was my first impression. other than that, i love it. \r\n\r\ni also respect
    what versonova said, but i also know when you fall in love with a concept it can
    be really hard to listen to others!!\r\n\r\nnice work\r\nPaul"
