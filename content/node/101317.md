  work with in InDesign, especially when there are a lot of weights. Grouping seems
  to be the norm (at least that I've noticed?) so it's always jarring to come across
  one that isn't grouped. \r\n\r\nSo, is it a conscious decision to set the files
  up like that? A technical limitation with the software used to create the font? "

  body: Thanks for the responses. So is it technically possible to have a family of
    singletons that still displays as a family in InDesign?

  body: Yes, I believe so. I've never tested this, though, because my customers all
    want linked families anyway.

    out the intricacies of font style-linking. I'm in Somerville, which is basically
    the same. There are probably more worthwhile endeavours.\r\n\r\nI used to use
    a free tool called TTX to dump out font tables in XML, not so much to solve problems,
    but to explain to others why things don't work in a particular OS/application.\r\n\r\nI
    think in ancient times, applications such as Quark would intervene, but it seems
    like a losing game because it doesn't really fix things at the generalized font
    level. Perhaps it will work for you over the interval at which you care.\r\n\r\nLet
    us know if you get it working."

    complex work-around (to create several naming systems within one font), which
    most newer professional font families will have. But thousands of font families
    where planned before there was an app called InDesign and it\u2019s not as simple
    as activating a check-box somewhere to make the grouping work in a way that is
    compatible with each and every software. \r\n\r\nBy the way: What makes ungrouped
    families \u201Cincredibly difficult\u201D to work with in InDesign?"
