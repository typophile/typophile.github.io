body: I'm not having much luck IDing this sample. Even after straightening it out,
  turning it black and white and running it through WhatTheFont. I'm sure this will
  be an easy one for the experts.

  body: "Hi Ryuk, I like your choices. Vafle and Purista both seem good for the letter-forms,
    but when comparing them with the unedited image, is see Vafle as a heavier weight,
    while Purista Medium seems pretty close. The best width for a match is tricky
    because of the slant. To my eye the regular width seems closer than a compressed.
    A font editor could produce an almost perfect match by sloping Purista Medium
    to the left by the same amount that Purista Medium Italic is sloped to the right.\r\nDon"
