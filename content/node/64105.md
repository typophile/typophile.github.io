  never hyphenate. The hyphenated word became two entities so far removed from the
  topic that they should be avoided at all costs.\r\n\r\nAnyone know that article?\r\n\r\nWhat
  words can you think of that would fit this bill?"

  body: An early newspaper pagination system, probably back in the 60s or early 70s,
    was reported to have hyphenated the word God. (I'm not sure which position the
    hyphen fell in, but the editor apparently used an unhyphenated God **** in his
    response when seeing the paper).

  body: I know this is off-topic since the words can be hyphenated, but the "hyphenation
    routines" in some computer systems have given a few real howlers. My wife reported
    "cow-orker" (for co-worker) long ago, and InDesign gave her sono-fabitch, in a
    book written, apparently, by one of Wyatt Earp's descendants. A "cow orker" sounds
    a bit gross, but "sono fabitch" has a nice sound.

  body: "The classic example of a word presenting a hazard in hyphenation is \"therapist\".\r\n\r\nIn
    Don's story, it may have been the traditional Jewish way to censor \"G-d\", and
    the system used the present hyphen as a line break. An en dash might be more appropriate,
    but I imagine it wouldn't prevent the problem!"

    i wonder how many more can be found from SNL celebrity jeopardy.\r\n\r\ni'm sure
    there are many words that lose their meaning but that is precisely what i'm talking
    about"

  body: Cooperative might be another, if the hyphen is placed after the p instead
    of between the os.

  body: "Our setters have fairly regular call to set \"streetsweeper\" and it took
    a bit of work to get 'em to hyphenate before the s, not after :-/\r\nI love my
    old 1985 Collins English Dictionary for the very reason that it's the last one
    I've seen to give preferred and to-be-avoided hyphenation points in all the headwords."
