  those who were not there, or otherwise missed the announcement at the gala dinner:
  the 2006 ATypI conference will take place in Lisbon, Portugal. M\xE1rio Feliciano
  will be leading the local team, working closely with Jean-Fran\xE7ois, me, and other
  ATypI board members. We have some promising leads on venues, and hope to confirm
  dates very soon."
