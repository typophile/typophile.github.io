  Community group and another for Fontlab has announced that it is closing all groups
  as of February 2009. It recommends that groups move to Microsoft's Multiply. \r\n\r\nIn
  view of the large number of typographers who are members of these groups, and the
  extensive messages containing valuable advice exchanged over the years, I wonder
  whether Typophile could or would want to offer to host these groups, members, messages
  and all? \r\n\r\nOr at least invite members to join Typophile?\r\n"

    We're also checking with FontLab as to their plans. We will have something in
    place by Feb.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    groups lacked a search function so a move here will be an improvement in that
    respect too.\r\nGood luck.\r\nVladimir"
