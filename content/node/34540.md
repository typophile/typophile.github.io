body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying to make the move form drawing glyphs in Illustrator
  to Fontlab, but I\u2019m having problems doing things in Foontlab that I would do
  in Illustrator. I\u2019m drawing the Oslash glyph I wanted to be able to center
  the slash on top of the O and then rotate it to make the glyph, is it possible to
  center the slash down the middle of the \u201CO\u201D. I know I can center the glyph
  in the window, but is it possible the align a shape to that glyph.\r\n\r\nHope this
  make sense I someone can help."

    to find center of 'O' and bar with guidelines (drag meter tool with right mouse
    button and select \"create guideline at 50%\" command in menu) then measure distance
    between these new guidelines and apply shift command from transformations panel
    to move the bar. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is much faster to do by eye, using Free transform
    tool."
