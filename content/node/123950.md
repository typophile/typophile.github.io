    have to edit it quite a bit, but Camphor gets the broad details right:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/camphor/[img:sites/default/files/old-images/camphor_5487.png]\r\n\r\nAlso
    very close:\r\nComenia Sans, by Suitcase\r\nMetric by Klim Type\r\nEquip Condensed
    by Hoftype\r\nTDC Bold by Dalton Maag (has the minimal |r|, |n|, and |p|, but
    the angle on the stroke ends isn\u2019t a match)\r\n\r\nThe Google web font, Ubuntu,
    is also minimalistic (including the |t|) and comes very close, but again the terminal
    stroke angle isn\u2019t a match."
