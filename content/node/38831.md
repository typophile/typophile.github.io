body: "Hello everyone, \r\n\r\nI am a final year student studying in the UK. Last
  month I attended the Plus Type Conference in Birmingham. I listened to a fascinating
  lecture about the Grotesque Italian by an American lecturer David Sheilds, from
  the University of Texas. \r\n\r\nA few days later I read up on American wood type
  generally, and was really inspired, in particular by some of the Antique Clarendon's
  shown within. I decided to try and recreate my own version digitally, as an italic.\r\n\r\nHere
  is my work so far. I have only created uppercase and numerals so far and would much
  appreciate any form of critique. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\n\r\nJonny\r\n\r\n"

    moved it while I was typing. So when I clicked subit, I got an error 404. ;)\r\n\r\nI
    think it was on the right board before (the critique board)? Now it's on your
    blog...\r\n\r\nI'll retype the comment later. (or edit it into this post)"

  body: It looks like a nice start at a display face. I can't see anything glaringly
    wrong with the letterforms, but I do think some of the numbers look almost like
    they're "falling over"...

    as I think that could be a possible solution.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your advice
