body: I thought I&#39;d post this here, since Mark is here, and since I privately
  mailed him about a similar issue a while back, and also because I&#39;m at my wit&#39;s
  end. <BR> <BR>I use Anonymous in 7 point &#40;on Windows 2000&#41; as my monospaced
  point font of choice. A while back, I noticed that some apps were sponateously applying
  font smoothing when I used it, which I told Mark about. He fiddled around inside
  Fontographer and released another copy of the font which didn&#39;t have this problem,
  and I&#39;ve been happy ever since &#40;except for those apps I can&#39;t seem to
  coax to use Anonymous 7 pt.&#41; <BR> <BR>However, recently, Emacs has been applying
  the same smoothing to the font when I use it in any point size. This is _only_ Emacs
  &#40;version 21.2 the Windows 95/NT build&#41;, and not any of my other text editors,
  including XEmacs. I realize this is all highly geeky and programmer-centric, but
  I&#39;m hoping someone else has a hint or an idea &#40;Mark?&#41;. Oddly, I used
  Emacs a while back with the same font &#40;and point size&#41; without issue, but
  I&#39;m wondering if sometime between then &#40;early 2002&#41; and now a fractional
  upgrade build of Emacs changed it&#39;s font handling on Windows such that this
  would crop up. <BR> <BR>As a stab in the dark, I tried turning off all the smoothing
  for Anonymous in FontLab 4.0, built a new font, and installed that, but no such
  luck. Emacs is almost certainly to blame, since again, it&#39;s the only app now
  exhibiting this behavior since my initial run in and Mark&#39;s updated version.
  <BR> <BR>Cheers.
