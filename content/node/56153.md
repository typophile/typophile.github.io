  body: "Hi Tim,\r\n\r\nwelcome to Typophile!\r\n\r\nI think this is plain [[Futura]]
    (Medium Condensed), with added bars on the \u2018I\u2019, and a broadened L \u2013
    to make it monospaced.\r\nThe ink traps of \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018N\u2019 are
    too characteristic.\r\nF\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_2\"

  body: Wow, Florian. This was driving me crazy. I was looking for a sans with bars
    on the I's. Nothing came close. Didn't even consider that they we added.

    font, and indeed it is Futura Medium Condensed\r\n\r\nFor those interested this
    is a page from the magazine, Avant Garde I believe.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KALINA1b_6185.jpg]"
