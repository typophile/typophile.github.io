  it possible - or legal - to make it easier using Adobe Arabic font and its sample
  VOLT code??\r\n\r\n* I mean changing all the glyph shapes in Fontlap.\r\n* generating
  a .ttf file.\r\n* opening it withe VOLT and import sample VOLT code provided by
  Thomas Phinney. then just making edits to it.\r\n\r\nIt's sound simple, but i don't
  know if this -so easy- method is bug-free or even legal!? what do guys think?"
