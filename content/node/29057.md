body: "Hi Folks, \r\n\r\nHere are two mysteries. The 'Black Pearl' script seems very
  familiar, but I was not able to find it in my Script Guide or my various books.
  Any ideas about what it is?\r\n\r\nThe 'PORTLAND, OR' titling face seems similar
  to Waters Titling, but it's semi-serif. Anyone know what it is?\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your help, \r\n- Mike"

    But don't know if that's the original ...

  body: "Great work Renko and Skylar. That's it all right. Thanks. I'll pass that
    along to the person with the question.\r\n\r\nAs for the titling face, I agree
    Yves, it does resemble some of Michael Harvey's work, like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/strayhorn-mt/\">Strayhorn</a>,
    but I also found it has similarity to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/agfa-rotis-semi-serif/\">Rotis
    Semiserif</a>, but not a match. I'd like to know what it is.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
