  BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve heard of people lowering the x-scale of certain fonts
  by two or three percent when setting for extended reading. Could someone clarify
  why this is? I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s something that obly applies to fonts with
  quite wide letterforms. <BR> <BR>thanks!

    <BR>---- <BR> <BR>It has to do with optimal readability depending on point size.
    <BR>Comparing the newspaper and the book for example, the latter format tends
    to point sizes optimal for immersive reading, while the former uses smaller sizes
    to promote portability and reduce cost. As a result, books use fonts with generous
    extenders to promote boumas &#40;word shapes&#42;, the core of immersive reading&#41;
    while newspapers use fonts with generous x-heights to promote legibility &#40;through
    plain old visibility&#41; in adverse conditions &#40;like a bumpy, dark train&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Or more accurately letter-cluster shapes. <BR> <BR>The optimal
    vertical proportions of a font depend on its intended balance between readability
    and legibility - as well as the particular language&#39;s usage of the Cartesian
    space. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    on a certain other list... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Although I am unfamiliar with &#34;lowering the x-scale&#34;, I suspect that
    it refers to horizontal scaling &#40;along the x-axis&#41; rather than x-height.
