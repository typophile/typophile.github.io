body: "I'm looking to make the jump from Quark 6.5 to InDesign CS2 when I get back
  to school. I've seen a lot of thoughts about this and even just for the usage of
  OpenType fonts that I have it'll be worth it. The only thing that is rather daunting
  to me is not knowing any of the vital keyboard shortcuts, besides the default Adobe
  ones that aren't application specific. I've attached a PDF of what I'm looking for,
  although this is for Photoshop CS2 and not InDesign. Or even something that compares
  the Quark ones to the Adobe ones? I hope this is the right place to put this! \r\n\r\nI
  start back at school in 3 weeks so I'm going to be prepping myself since I'll be
  involved in 3 lab classes that will require useage of layout programs: Environmental
  Design, Typography III and Annual Report Design. Thanks in advance for any pointers
  that you can give as far as this switch goes!"

    help file which clearly list an innumerable amount of valuable shortcuts for most
    tasks. I found these by keyword searching the help file.\r\n\r\nGood luck, I strongly
    recomend InDesign, having left Quark for InDesign 1.something I have not looked
    back.\r\n\r\n-nic\r\n"
