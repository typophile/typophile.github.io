  just wondered if anyone could expand on the meaning of the one that attracted me
  the most?\r\n\r\n\"Helvetica is the typeface for a deserted island\" - Friedrich
  Friedl\r\n\r\nI'm asking just so I can get my head around the understanding of the
  quote, would be great if anyone could emphasise the meaning of this to me!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"
