  Was wondering if anyone could recommend a good art-deco (or similar) font to use.
  \ My base font is going to be Futura, so something that would play well with that
  would be great. Mostly looking for something for background text elements that will
  add some atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    Wundersch\xF6ne Schrift. Ich pers\xF6nlich finde nur schade, dass das /c/ so breit
    ist, das macht die Schrift in meinen Augen f\xFCr den Satz auf Deutsch eher ungeeignet."

  body: "I don't really think that smart type captures the essence of vintage Hollywood,
    which utilized hand lettering so much.\r\nThis was demonstrated by the success
    (IMO) of Neville Brody's recent custom face for <em>Public Enemies</em>, which
    was slightly off-kilter in its proportions. And I don't think that the 1920s is
    well represented by geometric art deco; perhaps something more <em>moderne</em>.\r\n\r\nNick
    Curtis has a lot of suitable fonts, based on hand lettering: http://www.nicksfonts.com/\r\n\r\nHere
    is a type which is nonetheless authentic to both the 20s and 30s:\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/MeyerTwo/\r\n\r\n"

    \r\nI never felt it like that. The c rather corresponds to the shapes of d, q,
    &c\xAA, I always thought this is proper.\r\nHowever, thanks for the compliment."
