  first one I am looking to ID is for the \"Dianova\" at the top left.\r\n\r\nIf you
  look along the left hand side of the page you will come across a gif animation that
  says: \"Empowering my life!\". This is the second one I am looking to ID.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPhil"

    organization, therefore I highly doubt that they paid to have a font modified.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    they used something very similar to DIN?\r\n\r\nIn which case, do you have any
    idea what it might be?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPhil"

  body: "I am afraid Renko is right. Read this link: http://www.dianova.ch/en/events/archives/0901-visual-identity.html
    of which here is an extract:\r\n\r\nJanuary 2008 - For its tenth anniversary,
    Dianova decided to revise its visual identity in order to adjust it to the organization\u2019s
    current reality. To live up to this objective, the logo had to convey the continuity
    of Dianova\u2019s unchanging values, while, at the same time, present them with
    a new, more modern and brighter image.\r\n\r\nTo reach this objective, we utilized
    the flexible and dynamic typography of the DIN font family, which we felt was
    also capable of communicating value and innovation. In addition, in order to give
    more depth to Dianova\u2019s ongoing innovative character, the letter \u2018n\u2019
    was modified to make it different and unique, emphasizing the way we look, through
    different eyes, at the rapidly changing problems of modern society.\r\n\r\nMore
    information here  http://www.dianova.ca/newsletter/16/fr/page03.html (in French)."
