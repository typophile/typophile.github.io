  are identical, so I'm hoping it's an actual font rather than a custom design. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nCallie\r\n\r\nedited
  to add: I apologize for not being able to insert the image directly into the message.
  The proxy server I am going through will not allow me to utilize the \"Insert image\"
  function, so I had to include the image as an attachment instead. Not sure why one
  works for me while the other doesn't. Thanks to anyone who takes the extra time
  to view the attachment - I do appreciate it! "

  body: "It reminds me of Neville Brody's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/insignia/insignia-roman/characters.html|Insignia]]
    if you stripped it down and melted a bunch of it away, so to speak.\r\n\r\nNote
    that there is an alternate S sort of like the logo's. Even the lines through the
    stems have an echo in the logo, as do the foot serifs on the the L's. \r\n\r\nSaying
    all this only means I am suggesting maybe Insignia helped inspire the logo lettering,
    but I don't think the logo is a font. It is simple enough to have easily been
    hand-drawn.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks everyone. I had started thinking it must be hand drawn, but I just
    saw that the same font is used all over their website for menu titles (http://www.blueoystercult.com/Band-main.html).
    I am going to try to contact the webmaster to see if I can find out what they
    used, as the titles are all graphics. We'll see. \r\n\r\nThanks again! "

    bit off.
