body: "Hello,\r\nI really love this design.\r\nI believe this was created in 1969
  or 1970 by Lou Dorfsman, to commemorate the moon landing.\r\nIs this some variation
  of Kabel? The 6 and 9 numerals look more geometric and Futura-like... the stems
  are straight and not curved. The stems of the 6 and 9 numeral figures are curved
  in every digital version of Kabel that I can find online.\r\nThe 2 numerals also
  have more completely-closed loops. \r\nDid this change when Kabel was converted
  from photo type to digital? Or is this some kind of modified typeface that was created
  by Dorfsman for this one use?\r\n(I also think the zeroes are actually uppercase
  O letters.)\r\n\r\nThanks for any thoughts you have on this!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KABEL_SAMPLE_3490.png]"

  body: Yes, it is a version of Kabel - having looked at my pre 1980 ITC catalog it
    is not from the ITC phototype era, but is so close to Kabel it must be some version.
    As you point out the 6 and 9 are not like any version I can see. The zeros have
    to be Os and the 6 and 9 may be the same glyph flipped.

  body: 'Could be a Kabel / Cable typeface as formerly supplied by VGC, or more likely
    in this case: Photolettering. Or a variation designed by Lubalin, Smith & Carnase:

  body: Found a VGC version of Kabel that has the 6 and 9 having a gap like the two
    - but the top stem is not straight so not related to your sample.
