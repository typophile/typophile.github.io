  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">G'day, <BR> <BR>I have just been employed as a  <BR>graphic designer/signwriter at <BR>a place called &quot;Signz 'n Graphix&quot;. <BR>It seems that I have some at a  <BR>fortunate time, as we have decided  <BR>to totally redesign, starting from  <BR>our internal processes to applied <BR>identity. At the moment we design, <BR>print (digital xerox and riso), vinyl <BR>and photographic signage, large <BR>format quality art reproductions. <BR>We want to keep it simple and  <BR>apply the branding to business <BR>cards to outdoor signage. I have <BR>chosen Thesis Sans as the main <BR>typeface as it appears to work very <BR>well from large to small. I am thinking <BR>of a pallette of yellow+black, a homage <BR>to nz's road signs and blatant visiblity. <BR>At the moment the building is a purple <BR>colour and promoted as &quot;the purple <BR>place&quot;. I think it is quite tired (15 years) <BR>and dated, as the road signage is pretty <BR>much invisible from a distance and  <BR>a new building next door blocks the view <BR>of our premises from the road. <BR> <BR>The bottom image shows our current <BR>street sign from 50m down the road. <BR>I am trying to get the name spelt  <BR>'correctly' - signs &amp; graphics instead <BR>of signz n' graphix, which is a pain <BR>to spell and looks amateurish. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42915.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42916.gif" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kris &ndash; <BR> <BR>What you've done already is a huge improvement on what can only be described as ghastly. I like the yellow / black combo, and as much as that purple makes me heave, it would sit as well as anything with it. I love the elegance of logo one, and the second version tickles me. I would also agree that it simply HAS to be spelt right. I'm curious as to what kind of client you receive. The few suggestions you've already mocked up suggest a marked jump in 'quality' of client.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kris, your intensions might be right but if the business is registered as siznz and graphix it might cost your company some nz bucks to get it changed even if you can. Someone else might have the name signs and graphics and thats why they used that name in the first place.  <BR> As for your graphics The colors are good and I like the pencil with wings, but could you investigate another yellow? Why be exactly like a road sign. Also doesn't yellow fade when exposed to sunlight over time?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Looks like a real challenge you have ahead of you Kris. Currently, I would be embarrassed to drive into this parking lot. I might even where sunglasses and a trenchcoat before getting out of my car and walking in. But it seems like you could really transform this companies identity into something spectacular. Looks like fun! You could approach it in many ways. There is something strangley interesting and friendly about the shape of the building. It could be really cool to incoorporate an icon of the building with Logo #1 Almost like rest stop signage. It's a not so special building that could be made to feel really important and sophisticated. Anyway, just a thought, GOOD LUCK!</div>
