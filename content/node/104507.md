body: "I've been working on a book for a client that's a 'brief' (read, 400 pages)
  history of trust that links one of the old English Universities with a Japanese
  bank. Up till this point I've been using ITC Garamond Std for the main body of the
  text and Optima LT Std for other things on the page, the page numbers, book title
  in the top left corner etc. I'd been using these because this is what the client
  told me to use, but she's sent an email asking for suggestions for changing the
  'look' of the page. She wants to keep it very \"elegant, smart and artful\" so I
  was wondering if anyone had suggestions for alternatives, particularly for Optima
  - I usually work with sans serif fonts so this is pretty new territory for me. \r\nIf
  anyone knows a good combination using Garamond - or an alternative, I'm not too
  rigid at this point - that'd be a lifesaver!\r\n"

  body: "<cite>the page numbers</cite>\r\n\r\nThey're called \"folios\"\r\n\r\nThere
    is no way to teach you how to design a book in an internet post, just like you
    can't teach me -- a good book interior designer -- how to make an effective print
    ad with a post or two.\r\n\r\nBTW, in the book world, ITC Garamond is generally
    considered a joke.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, for an Optima-like variant, take a
    look at Sumner Stones's <strong>Magma</strong> -- I think a weight in the *compact*
    family  might serve you best, perhaps the semi-bold for the smaller type, normal
    for anything over, say, 24 point, but use you own judgement.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stonetypefoundry.com/magmaoverview.html\r\n\r\nFor
    the text, it kind of depends if you want to emphasize that historical feel with
    a traditional typeface, or use something that would appeal to a post-2000 audience.
    I've heard people say of Scala, for example \"Oh, it's so 1990s...\"\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, it is best to be sure of your text face first, then select a display.
    Here's an off-the-wall suggestion I have used, Magma for display and Quadraat
    for text. It is elegant, but definitely not elegant old-school-British (i.e.,
    Caslon, Baskerville, Scotch). I have used the Quadraat/Magma pairing several times
    for an academic works, once I believe for a university press book on an analysis
    of the I Ching. It met it's audience & I think looked quite nice.\r\n\r\nPretty
    sure this is the one, but sadly, you can't \"look inside.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Fathoming-Cosmos-Ordering-World-Evolution/dp/0813927056\r\n\r\nFWIW"

    bookstore and \uFB01nd some books with type treatments that you think will be
    appropriate to the task in hand, and that you also like the look of. The trick
    is to then identify said fonts\u2014which you can do here in the ID forum, or
    at MyFonts \u201CWTF\u201D."

  body: "It is indeed very hard to give good advice here, but any advice is better
    than none.\r\n\r\nTo narrow down your search, I would offer these beliefs of mine:\r\n-
    Don't use a sans for a large amount of text.\r\n- One way to look \"elegant\"
    is to use a (relatively) narrow font.\r\n- Another way is to use a font with long
    extenders (i.e. small x-height).\r\n- The category of type that best conveys \"trust\"
    is wedge serifs.\r\nSome mentioned here: http://typophile.com/node/39407\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Brilliant, thank you all for the advice and suggestions of fonts, it's been
    a real help. Particularly about ITC Garamond, I'm only two days off of 18 so I'm
    not exactly well versed in what the industry thinks of certain fonts. I'll try
    the ones you said out, thanks again!

  body: "Note that the scorn of the industry is usually directed just at ITC's particular
    cut of Garamond, not at Garamond altogether. You might try Garamond Premier Pro
    (which is an Adobe font, but not the same as Adobe Garamond) for a more authentic,
    and arguably more \"elegant\" and \"smart\" alternative.\r\n\r\nApart from these
    adjectives, is there any particular aesthetic / time period / culture / mood you're
    aiming for? Have you thought about other aspects of the design \u2014 trim size?
    kind of paper? margins? measure? layout? second color? All these things will have
    an impact on how your design feels."
