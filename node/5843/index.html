		<div class="commentbody">I guess it wouldn't necessarily be considered cheating since I was supplied with a font (Diamanti Condensed) by the art director to use as a basis/inspiration.  I believe the logo was designed 40+ years ago and appears to be a custom design, otherwise, I think a font would have been used or supplied by the company with no need for a newly created font.  But, as per your suggestion, I've already been sketching in pencil and in Illustrator possible ideas for characters and I'll probably post the results in the Critique section for feedback.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As someone much older than 40, I can say that I don't think that Milky Way logo is that old. My recollection is that they used to have a script not that many years ago. It was the same color, but it wasn't that lettering (I think). <BR> <BR>The current lettering is almost surely a custom design, but I agree with Yves. If your instructor gave you something to use, then that should be all the 'help' you'll need. <BR> <BR>James, you're trying to learn design, not copying, right? And it doesn't matter if you disapprove of the letterforms, since your assignment is to design something based on it. Think of it as a client who loves this lettering and wants to expand the hand-drawn logo into a typeface for other ad copy, not someone asking you to design something you like.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's been fun with all this kidding around, but the one thing they try to keep is enough continuity to maintain brand recognition. Patricia's link early in this thread showed that. The green lettering has been around a long time, even if the shape of the letters has changed. So has the use of chocolate and nougat (sortof) colors, behind those letters.  You see those things and you don't really need to see the lettering. You already know it's Milky Way. That kind of recognition is priceless in a competitive market. <BR> <BR>OK, now I have to go back and think about what Chesh said about the Midnight Sun and the Coriolis effect. Huh? ;-) <BR></div>
