  been interested in the realationship between how typography and image in much of
  my work I have decided to research in this area. <BR> <BR>I have my own thoughts
  as to how the study will be directed. However I would appreciate it if anyone had
  any thoughts on what could be included to produce an interesting piece on the subject.
