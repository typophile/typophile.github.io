body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\njust because it has a lot to do with the typography, I\u2019ll
  make me bold and post a logotype I made for 4th Virtual Biennale of Graphic Design,
  which was held by <a href=\"http://aug.cz\">AUG</a> \u2013\_the topic was \u2018Discrimination\u2018
  and as usual, <a href=\"http://www.aug.cz/virtualni-biennale/2010/ucastnici-bienale-participants-of-the-biennale.htm\">submitted
  posters</a> had to be just in black and white. And that\u2019s why I decided to
  make a simple typographic logotype, using <a href=\"http://suitcasetype.com/index.php?lmut=cz&part=fonts&font=25\">Tom\xE1\u0161
  Brousil\u2019s Comenia Sans</a> typeface.\r\n\r\nEventhough it has been already
  published, I will be pleased to read any comments and critics, while feedback is
  always very welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks, JT\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://mancaft.cz/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/toman-diskriminace_logo.png\">\r\n\r\n(the

  body: "This looks like a discrimination to /i/.\r\n\r\nI like it even though I'd
    rather choose a different font with less round shapes and squared dots on /i/.
    This would make a better blend of dot and /s/ or /o/.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise it's
    a very nice idea and makes the point of discrimination. Very well done indeed."

  body: "I don\u2019t think this is a good idea at all.\r\n\r\nIt is a very simple
    optical gag, the ligation/contraction of the i\u2019s body.\r\nVery nice.\r\nWhat
    has this to do with discrimination?\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s not really wit in it. "

    to be interesting or memorable."
