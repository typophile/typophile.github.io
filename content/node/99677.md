    Maxi for text.

    people have a problem with it for lengthy body text. If that is the case, then
    the Futura Maxi recommendation would prove wiser.\r\n"

    had been using the exact same format for 20 years.\r\nUnderstandably the art staff
    got a little bored, and changing to trendy new typefaces jazzed things up.\r\nBut
    with Marta for visual interest on the cover, not really necessary!"
