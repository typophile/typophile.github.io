  body: This looks like spam to me. If enough people disagree I will leave it. If
    not - I will have to kill this thread. Obviously the line can be vague at times
    between real legit promo & spam but to my eyes this fall on the wrong side. Partly
    this is because chop shop isn't quite type related enough to slide by.

    of having interesting type on it. Really quirky % symbol.\r\n\r\nA lot of of nice
    use of type on the products featured in the shop too. \r\n\r\nI'm happy to have
    been pointed to it.   "

    are not allowed to put spam in the blog either. On the other hand...\r\n\r\nIf
    folks don't think it's spam, then it isn't. Arun, thanks for weighing in. "

  body: "I understand\u2026 I admittedly use forums like this to get our stuff out
    there. Generally people react pretty positively to them. But I can see how this
    would seem like spam. There is a fine line. My biased view is that if the message
    is targeted to a proper audience people generally do not mind. If this were about
    viagra or penis enlargement then there is no argument. I guess its about abuse\u2026
    if and when too many post things like I did then it would likely become a nuisance.
    \r\n\r\nI would understand if it were deemed inappropriate. Just sharing my logic.\r\n_____\r\nwww.choppingblock.com\r\nwww.chopshopstore.com\r\nwww.wanderingspace.net\r\nwww.grodzki.com"

  body: "Thanks for sharing your logic. But I don't think it's just a question of
    what you are promoting.\r\n\r\nAlso, in general when I see a post that doesn't
    seem to have any type/font/letter/calligraphic related content I start to get
    suspicious. Also there has been a bit of an uptick in obvious spam around here
    so I am a bit more vigilant. \r\n\r\nAlso, looking at your posts I see a better
    than 50% promotional post rate which is to my eyes at least a bit high. You are
    clearly getting positive feedback for your designs. But personally I want to encourage
    you to use Typophile for ( as I understand it ) - it's intended purpose. The exchange
    of information, help, ideas etc. \r\n\r\nThink about it. If we all did what you
    are doing Typophile would poorer for it. Do you see what I mean?\r\n\r\nIn the
    meantime you should consider that I have given you a \"<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_card_(sports)#Red_card>yellow
    card</a>\".\r\n\r\nIf the other Mods disagree please speak up here or contact
    me off the board.\r\n"

  body: I have been in contact with the other Moderators here on the board & they
    say that although spirit of what I was saying has some merit, because this is
    a blog entry I am being to severe. I think they are right. So I take it back.
    Sorry.
