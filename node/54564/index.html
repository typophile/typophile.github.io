  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been asked to make this little art exhibition catalog for an association I&rsquo;m a member of. This is pro-bono work, so I can&rsquo;t spend two weeks on it (or license any additional fonts)… and still of course I want it to become at least nice enough to put my name on it.</p>
<p>Below is a sketch for the cover (really rough still). I sent it to the client today, and he said he loves the illustration (which isn&rsquo;t mine btw), but the type is &ldquo;too hard to read&rdquo;. He suggested Frutiger or something. :-/
I&rsquo;ve also asked a few laymen to read out the headline; while some of them read it instantly, others were struggling.</p>
<p>Now consciously inducing (or at least tolerating) legibility problems would not really be something I&rsquo;d be very proud of; on the other hand though, I feel this book can do with a bit of uncommon design at least on the outside (it&rsquo;s an art book! Come on).</p>
<p>And I guess my main problem is that I&rsquo;m really badly in love with how Sangue connects to the illustration and seems to &ldquo;grow&rdquo; out of the girl&rsquo;s head/brain – which seems to make a lot of sense. So I&rsquo;d really hate to change the basic concept, or the font.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the dilemma. Here&rsquo;s the question: 
Do you guys</p>
<ol>
<li>see a chance of changing this in a way that would improve legibility of the title without completely changing the concept?</li>
<li>think this sucks, my client&rsquo;s right, and I&rsquo;m deluded?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Really good &amp; simple idea too. The small stuff on the right is the editors' names, which I decided to blur before posting. Those are set in Legato Light*, kinda small, but I could see me adding the title above that in the Regular, maybe slightly larger. Sounds like a simple and elegant solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which I might end up using inside the book as well.</li>

<p>I guess the client could still stress out over the headline not reading from a distance… on the other hand, I guess I could stress out about not getting paid anyway &amp; just doing it my way? :-/</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the input guys.
I agree that some of the lettershapes may be problematic (like the &ldquo;a&rdquo;), though I&rsquo;m hoping I can offset that by moving the type and illustration farther apart and such. I actually suck at calligraphy, so there&rsquo;s no way on Earth I could re-create something like this but slightly modified (and like I said above, I&rsquo;m a bit worried that modifying the type digitally may do more harm than good).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Is there a cap?&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Yes (see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->), but it has quite different proportions. Some first mixed-case trials were not successful, but I&rsquo;ll give it another shot (tomorrow – it&rsquo;s 3am here ;-) ).</p>
<p>James, when you say &ldquo;Check the proportions on the face&rdquo;, do you mean the girl&rsquo;s face or the typeface? If the former: The illustration is in the process of being tweaked (there&rsquo;s some strange stuff going on on the forehead too). Anything specific that strikes you as odd? Too female I guess?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I understand your thoughts about the unity of the type and art. One alternative would be to keep the type in black, but blend the bottom of it a gray or one of those &ldquo;close to gray&rdquo; colors in the art. The primary legibility problem is that the bottoms of the a, o, and d are lost in the art. You might try playing with raising the type up some so that the bottoms of those letters are more visibile, although that will once again tend to destroy the unity of the type and art.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another possibility: Keep your title type in black (perhaps with the fade to gray), then repeat the title in a hairline sans-serif type that is set in tightly-packed flush right block and place it where the editors' names are now. (Use a larger point size &ndash; so that the depth of the new two-line title is about the same as the depth of the current editors' text block), then move the editor&rsquo;s text block to lower on the page, probably aligned with the mouth in the art.

<p>During immersive reading, yes (although clusters of letters, not necessarily -although often- whole words). During deliberative reading however the reader has many seconds to unequivocally identify the individual letters, which is more robust.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here&rsquo;s a modified version in three color variants.</p>
<p>The main thing I did was move the type and art a bit further apart, and &ldquo;untangle&rdquo; the &ldquo;hair&rdquo; especially around the &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;o&rdquo;, and &ldquo;d&rdquo; to make those letters more easy to grasp in their entirety. (The untangling isn&rsquo;t done – those leaves are endlessly complex once you start working on them…)
The graphical intensity may have suffered a bit from this? But legibility seems to improve quite a bit, and I tend to think it&rsquo;s a workable compromise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added a second title on the right; except in #3, in which I think the headline really stands out enough to be legible in his own right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also reworked the woman&rsquo;s face. I&rsquo;m not positive the anatomy is quite right, but (and maybe this is caused by sleep deprivation) I see a bit of an interesting tension between the black and the white especially around her mouth and nose, which didn&rsquo;t seem to be there before. (Although this doesn&rsquo;t seem to show so well in these little JPEGs.)</p>
<p>Btw the cap &ldquo;A&rdquo; def didn&rsquo;t work. Looked way too… medieval? The lc seems to be more minimal in its blackletteresqueness (!).</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArtOfMind_Variant1a_5653.jpg]
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArtOfMind_Variant2a_5659.jpg]
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArtOfMind_Variant3a_4019.jpg]</p>
<p>&ndash;
I must say I&rsquo;m still most convinced by the black &amp; white treatment in #1. 
#3 seems too &ldquo;Goth&rdquo; and places too much emphasis on the headline. 
What do you guys think?</p>
<p>Cheers!
(And sorry about the bad JPG compression. Let me know if you&rsquo;d like a PDF.)</p>

First of all I think the title is quite legible as it is on your latest example, so the smaller title seems redundant. Secondly, even if the title on the front is hard to read for some, does it really matter? Why not just put the title in a more legible typeface on the spine (it&rsquo;s from this side the book is going to be seen most of the time anyway) and leave the front hard to read for some, but (and very much because of this &ldquo;inacessibility&rdquo;) a lot more interesting?</div>

<em>sigh</em>… you know, I do agree.
I&rsquo;m mostly trying to do <em>something</em> that will give the client the comforting idea that I&rsquo;m taking his concerns into consideration, and meeting him halfway so to speak (because I&rsquo;m not changing the headline font, which is really what he wanted me to do). Then again, maybe I&rsquo;ve done enough for legibility by freeing the headline from all those excessive weeds.
I&rsquo;m really not very used to the idea of having a lot of &ldquo;artistic freedom&rdquo;, and to assert it too, especially when it runs counter to a client&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;Why not just put the title in a more legible typeface on the spine&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;ll have to check back. This is going to be a book-on-demand production, and the last time we worked with them there seemed to be no way to print on the spine (although their web site seems to say otherwise… hm). Which would suck big time because this design would really need to run around the entire cover. :-|</p>

Seems a bit… extremist. I don&rsquo;t really see such a crucial difference between doing this in Illustrator vs. directly in FontLab, given that it&rsquo;s only one glyph that I&rsquo;m gonna use exactly once. 
That said, I have started out in Illustrator, and for the basic search of what this should look like, that&rsquo;s fine at least for the moment.</p>

That would be the way I understood it: Modifying Illustrator outlines is ok, messing around directly in FontLab is not. The distinction isn&rsquo;t arbitrary, but feels kind of stupid to me (and please correct me too if I&rsquo;m being ignorant): If I have something printed that uses a font with a modified glyph in it, who cares if it was modified in Illustrator, or directly in the font?
Are they just worried about modified versions of the font floating around? (Wow, two breaches of one EULA.)</div>

So you could copy-paste from FontLab to Illustrator.</p>

It does take the two titles apart visually, but to my eyes, it places too much emphasis on the &ldquo;second&rdquo; title, making the whole composition read, in order of visual hierarchy, (1) &ldquo;art of mind&rdquo;; (2) illustration leading to: (3) &ldquo;art of mind&rdquo; [again]; then (4) the small print – thereby taking the redundancy of the two titles to extremes. It makes the second one a distinct, and very prominent, element.
The version I proposed above would read (to me) more like, (1) &ldquo;art of mind&rdquo;; (2) illustration; (3, here comes the small print) &ldquo;Art of mind. Edited by, blah blah blah.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;m probably going to try and sell (ha ha) it to him without the second title.</p>
<p>Hrant, thanks for the clarification – I didn&rsquo;t get the importance of outputing.

The same probably goes for more people on this board, but most of us here are surrounded by and work with letters all day long, so we might not be the best people to judge the legibility.</p>
<p>That said, I think the treatment in the initial design works really well, since the type nicely blends with the illustration. I saw someone say that this is a problem, but I think it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>
<p>However, your last options seem to cover a nice middle ground. I don&rsquo;t think they betray your concept that much. Although I would not repeat the title with normal type, I think it somehow takes away some of the power the headline type has (and it may also look like you underestimate the reader).</p>
<p>And a 6 mm spine shouldn&rsquo;t really be a problem to print on? I&rsquo;ve printed type on such spines before. The type will just have to be small (obviously), so you will have to use a typeface which can handle that (and; add very clear folding lines to your PDF in the bleed area, and tell them to take special notice to the spine).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Cool, thanks for your feed-back Quincunx.
Re the spine: The problem is indeed the margin of error – the 2mm mentioned above. Subtract 2mm from either side of a 6mm spine and you end up with 2mm of space for type. :-/</p>
<p>AtoZ, agree about the n+1 opinions. 
I originally wasn&rsquo;t going to post this here, as I don&rsquo;t really have time to spend days on end discussing and revising it. But once again, feed-back from you guys has been invaluable*, especially as I had been getting quite insecure about the legibility issue. So, thanks again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also when we didn&rsquo;t agree.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will get back with [pre-]finals, and probably with that &ldquo;a&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of that 2 mm rule, and I&rsquo;ve designed alot of poetry books which often have narrow spines. I recently designed one with a 5 mm (!) spine, and I used a 9 pt. FF Milo on it. Not a problem at all. I just marked the fold lines really clearly in the bleed area and told them to take care when binding them.</p>
<p>However, I was quickly looking through my poetry book InDesign files, and those with 100-ish pages all have a spine more in the range of 1 cm. This is just with regular paper you often see in books (whatever it&rsquo;s called in English), which isn&rsquo;t that heavy/thick. So are you sure that 6 mm estimate is accurate?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Jelmar, the 6mm estimate is based on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>a &ldquo;calculator&rdquo; that this book on demand service has on their web site (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for reference, though it&rsquo;s all in German). If I put the variables in there – paperback, 100 pages, 17×22cm, standard white paper –, it gives me 0.6 cm for the spine (&ldquo;Buchrückenbreite&rdquo;).</li>
<li>another book I made last year that they produced, which has 92 pages, and about 6.5mm on the spine. (I&rsquo;m just assuming they only have one standard paper sort, so this may be compatible.)</li>
</ol>
<p>So I&rsquo;m assuming that&rsquo;s more or less accurate, though it might be closer to 7mm than 6. I can&rsquo;t calculate it, as they&rsquo;re not really giving specific information about the paper they use – though I might try calling them about that.</p>
<p>The 2mm margin of error is bad; I&rsquo;ve had that happen before in cheap-ish digital printing, though.</p>

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sangue_binocular-a_6661.gif]</p>
<p>I basically tried to reach a compromise between trying to find shapes that would match the font (and get the attitude in!), and still keep it open/clear-cut enough for legibility. I decided against a thick horizontal stroke on the top (à la &ldquo;s&rdquo;), which looked clunky and didn&rsquo;t seem to make sense next to &ldquo;n&rdquo;, &ldquo;m&rdquo;, etc. My &ldquo;a&rdquo; was modeled mostly on the original &ldquo;a&rdquo;, a bit of the &ldquo;r&rdquo;, and a dash of &ldquo;d&rdquo; and &ldquo;o&rdquo;. And a healthy dash of gut feeling.</p>
<p>I dunno. I fully expect this to be off in a bunch of ways.
But I do think it already reads significantly better in the headline:</p>
<h2 id="imgsitesdefaultfilesold-imagesartofmind_v3_moda_5712gif">[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArtOfMind_V2_6238.gif]
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ArtOfMind_V3_modA_5712.gif]</h2>
<p>For the record, once I was on those curves, I also tried some other things I&rsquo;d been thinking about (like lengthening the ascender of the &ldquo;d&rdquo;), but that was not doing much really. The &ldquo;a&rdquo; however seems crucial. Thanks for pointing it out, Hrant.</p>
<p>Any opinions? I&rsquo;m gonna get back to the client with the revised version tomorrow.
(And thanks all; this is / has been great learning material as always!)</p>

So I fully understand that your client worries about legibility. However, that the title is not immediately recognizable or legible on the cover page will not prevent people from finding or reading the catalog. After all, the title will be printed inside the catalog as well (I assume this to be the case). After all, it&rsquo;s an art related work, so lack of legibility is maybe something that draws more interest to the work. &ndash; cs</div>
