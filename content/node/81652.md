body: "My friend Bruce Bowers and I are just about wrapping up a font that we collaborated
  on called Mocha Script. It is a Sign Painters script that is based on the city and
  state lettering used on Truck doors but it looks good wherever a script is needed.
  This font has over 243 characters which includeds alternates, ligatures and end
  characters. Coming May 18th to Letterhead fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.letterheadfonts.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://borgeslettering.com/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mocha-Script_3957.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for looking."
