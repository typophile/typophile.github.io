    cuts</a>. Personally I think ITC's version is not the most successful one.

  body: "> <em>Hey, maybe he\u2019s going for a retro 1980s look, in which case ITC
    can\u2019t be beat!</em>\r\n\r\nYou're very right -- if there's some historical
    context, then of course ITC New Baskerville should be his first choice. If not
    though, then he should go for specific atmosphere and character shapes.\r\n\r\n>
    <em>Which version of Baskerville is your favourite, Yves?</em>\r\n\r\nHaven't
    used any Baskerville in <em>ages</em>, but if I had to pick one, I'd go for [[Frantisek
    Storm]]'s <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-22-baskerville-original\">Baskerville
    Original</a>. Frantisek usually does his homework when digitizing classical models,
    plus the quality of his work is as reliable as a Swiss watch."

  body: "And I agree with Lari -- Fountain did a <em>very</em> nice <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FT.118653.0.0\">\"true-to-the-original\"
    version</a> with discretionary ligatures which is excellent value for money. But
    of course there's no Bold weights.\r\n\r\nBTW The only Baskerville I've been using
    in the past couple of years is [[Zuzana Licko]]'s infamous <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=mrs+eaves\">Mrs.
    Eaves</a>. It's a difficult typeface to set correctly, but when you succeed it's
    very satisfying. Not for the uninitiated."
