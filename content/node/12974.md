  can help! Please check out the following page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gamesandprint.co.uk/cardeng.htm\r\n\r\nThe
  font used on the corner of these cards (i.e. 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A) - can anyone
  help me ID it? It seems pretty standard across most of the english/UK decks I've
  played with.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nMartin"

    Characters.</a> derived from Bicycle cards. Should be what you''re looking for.  '
