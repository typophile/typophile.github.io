  I thank you in advance...\r\n\r\nI\u2019m redesigning a logo for one of my clients,
  which was set in Book Antiqua and has a very clunky outdated symbol. I\u2019m getting
  rid of the symbol and focusing on the typeface. I\u2019m redesigning the logo with
  Rotis semi-serif and I wanted to customize some of the letterforms, so trademark
  Rotis letters like \u2019e\u2019, \u2019c\u2019 will be different from the original
  typeface.\r\nDoes anyone have any good alternative suggestions?\r\n\r\n"

    Wunderlich</a>? (Rather similar to the semi-sans, though.)

    Optima...I might be able to work with this even though I need something slightly
    more serify...Thanks Jan!\r\n\r\nJonE."
