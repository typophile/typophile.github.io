    I hope Hrant is not going to make some tasteless pun on this remark ;&#41; &#41;</i>
    I&#39;ve got a magazine somewhere with some brilliant and witty solutions. One
    of the best was the one they had at MetaDesign. Believe me, it&#39;s a great exercise
    in symbol-making, because for some people it still is a sensitive subject.
