  body: There's not necessarily an existing typeface as a starting point. Some logos
    are designed from scratch, and this sure looks like one.

  body: i feel like it was started with something in the vein of cooper italic...

  body: I think for something like this, the starting point would have been some kind
    of drug, rather than a font. :-)

  body: FWIW, I agree with Yves that it probably wasn't based a specific font and
    was done from scratch.
