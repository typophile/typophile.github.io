  of our website. For whatever reason some of the source files are hard to access
  and we're trying to identify one of the fonts, but we're having trouble. So, naturally,
  I thought I'd hit up Typophile for help. Here are some URL's.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.twinadvertising.com/images/a-new-breed.gif\r\nhttp://www.twinadvertising.com/images/new-launches.gif\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks guys!"
