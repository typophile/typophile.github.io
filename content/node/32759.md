  set of 7 character typefaces. In the typfaces I am using 'alt a' (the apple sign).
  I have applied the letter to this character. Now, when it comes to generating the
  font, all is well and 6 of the letters work perfect. The seventh however, the 'alt
  a', does not seem to generate as a character. In inDesign, it shows the infamous
  outlined rectangle for a missing charater. \r\n\r\nI am very new to Fontographer
  so am totally stuck on this problem. Can anyone tell me why this character in particular
  is not generating. It is very important that it is this 'alt a' key.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\n\r\nMatt "

  body: "It's been a while since I used Fontographer, but wouldn't the charcter you've
    designed (that doesn't work) need to be placed in one of the boxes in the character
    map that uses the option key. For eg: \u2122, \xA9, #, \xB6 \r\n\r\nThe Apple
    key + a will SELECT ALL\r\n\r\nThe Option key is different.\r\n\r\nLet me know
    if this helps.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The apple symbol is not \"alt-a\", at least on the US keyboard layout. (It's
    shift-option-k.) Alt-a (or option-a) is \xE5. Maybe if you put your character
    in the \xE5 (aring) slot it will work the way you want.\r\n\r\n(Note also that
    the apple symbol is not normally accessible on Windows.)"
