    not \"to harshly\" since I'm not inviting you to take pot shots, unless you're
    throwing Boston Cream pies.\r\n"

  body: "Norbert, \r\nWell done!  It has your touch of humor.\r\nFrankly, I quit reading
    U&lc about the time of the format switch. At the time, I felt it had run its course.
    I wish the book focused more on the earlier years when U&lc was a real force in
    the industry.  I guess the editor felt he needed to focus on what he knew best
    (his own era) but I would like to see more from the Lubalin years when U&lc was
    breaking new ground.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Whew!\r\nNo pies in the face so far.\r\nThanks. Despite the shortfall of
    too few samples prior to 1981 (when Herb passed), it's great seeing the work of
    so many famous designers \"unleashed\"!\r\n"
