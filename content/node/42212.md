  body: "I don't like the ridiculously exaggerated faux small caps. Try going with
    real SC.\r\n\r\nThe small details within the 'A' might turn into a blob at small
    sizes. Try going with three shapes rather than six.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

- body: Those squiggles are a major problem, in my opinion. They're unbalanced and
    too detailed, and it seems glaringly obvious that the only reason the A is so
    big is to accommodate the squiggles. The giant A looks like it's about to stomp
    all over, or topple onto, the rest of the word.

  body: I immediately thought that the squiggles in the A were supposed to be a dove
    and this was a church logo.

  body: If you must respect the mark equity, simply shrink the A or a triangle, fill
    it in and drop the squiggles out in white. It wouldn't be a bad mark and would
    leave you something to call out.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arc1_5878.jpg]

    steampunk RPG game]] I was addicted to a while back.   Sorry, not exactly on-topic....  But
    this logo does look more appropriate for a period video game or movie than for
    a wealth management firm. '

  body: Cool - way better!  More distinctive, will probably scale better.  The spacing
    of the letters looks off to me - either loosen up the R-C-A or tighten the rest?
