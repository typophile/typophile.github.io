    I'm referring to a javascript onMouseOver/onMouseOut rollover for the navigation
    on the left. It could be as simple a change as creating an alternate version of
    that image with an underline. \r\n\r\nSome resources:\r\n\r\nhttp://webwonks.org/WebBuilding/Rollovers.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.elated.com/tutorials/programming/javascript/rollover_buttons/\r\n

    I have a lot of things on my plate right now, in a lot of different areas of interest,

    them, then puzzling out why it isn't working right, etc."

    a (free) pre-built template? Sure, not much in the way of distinction, but, quite
    frankly, if the budget is zero, this route at least gives you a well built, functional
    and standards-compliant web page that does what it's needed to do.\r\n\r\nThe

      was the point I was trying to avoid making the second time around. I didn't
      want to be so direct in the fact because the OP had asked for critique in good
      faith. When I wasn't given such a happy response to my suggestion, I did try
      to give some examples that do a reasonable job of explaining rollover implementation.\r\n\r\nThe
      thing that people must realize when coming out of nowhere with building pages
      for people is that there are certain basic standards that now exist on the web.
      Users are extremely fickle and basic things such as rollovers and hovers on
      links have become a set standard. It would do you well to spend the time to
      learn to use javascript rollovers at this time, because every page you build
      in the future should be using them as well.\r\n\r\nAs Jason says, the option
      of pre-built templates is definately there.\r\nThere are hundreds if not thousands
      of options from which to choose if you don't have the time or the want to explore
      building something on your own.\r\n\r\nI have always been a fan of doing something
      correctly, if I commit myself to doing it.\r\n\r\nYou were off to a good start.
      Hoever if you ask for constructive criticism and it is given to you in a polite
      manner I don't understand why all of a sudden you've struck back at me on the
      defensive.\r\n\r\nI aplogize if I offended you, but I was just trying to be
      helpful."

    fact that the nav jumps around a lot when you click from page to page. \r\n\r\nThe

    is a black art to me, so please ignore any comments which are impossible.\r\nRagging
    is the uneven margin of a text setting, on your home page there are some short
    (copy light) paragraphs that would probably be better if the measure was narrower,
    you are trying to achieve a smooth (not dead straight) righthand margin rather
    than zig-zagging. It isn't easy but is worth looking for, as it will improve not
    only the first impressions of the site and will make the reading process more
    pleasant. The term comes from a description of setting, for example, ranged left,
    ragged right would describe the setting on your (and this) site.\r\nAs a general
    observation screen graphics tend to look a lot better when there is a neutral
    background rather than white.\r\nI also get a heading in my tab saying \u201CYour
    heading goes here\u201D, this could be something to do with browser software.\r\nTim"
