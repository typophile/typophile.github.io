  really like it, but as I buy my fonts at MyFonts or Type.co.uk (because of PayPal)
  I was wondering if it will be released through one of these sellers any time soon.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot, and congrats on what looks to be a great typeface."

  body: Yes, MyFonts and Type.co.uk will carry it and have it available very soon.
    I have a lot of distributors, and released it to them all simultaneously, for
    reasons of diplomacy -- but they have different lead times to process new fonts
    and get them on sale.
