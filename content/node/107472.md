  body: Take a look at Lost Type's [[http://www.losttype.com/lavanderia/|Lavenderia]].
    Doesn't have the weight contrast that your sample has, but it does seem to match
    some of the letterforms, including the unusual swash on the uppercase O. It also
    has many stylistic alternatives, including end-of-word swashes on the t and n,
    similar to the sample.
