  college project, i'm doing it on GM foods!\r\n\r\nThe plan is to do an informative
  motion piece (kenetic) on the topic.\r\n\r\nCurrently i'm coming up with the script
  for the voice over and\r\nfrantically looking for the right typefaces.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for at san serif and serif for contrast.\r\n\r\nAny ideas would be much
