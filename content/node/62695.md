  body: "The right one is the logo of the Dutch hiphop radio show from the mid-nineties.
    It was designed by [[http://www.nielsshoemeulman.com|Niels 'Shoe' Meulman]] around
    that time. \r\n[[http://www.nielsshoemeulman.com/gfx/BBOY/DMasters.jpg|Here is
    the logo as it appears on his site]]."

  body: "Quincunx!\r\n\r\nYa I'm not sure how these two wound up together. I got this
    image from a hip hop blog. Not sure what the connection is between the two, aside
    from the fact that they appear to use the same type treatment. Maybe Shoe was
    involved with both, although I think I read that the All City design was someone
    else.\r\n\r\nBTW, I checked out some of your work. Furet is rad. Your calligraphy
    is ill."

  body: "I also have no idea what the connection between the two is. To be honest,
    the lettering on the can looks kinda clumsy compared to the Dutch Masters logo.\r\n\r\nAnd
    thanks for the compliments about my work. I spot some graffiti influence in your
    work. My love for letters partly comes from my graffiti days. ;)"

    check to see if he's affiliated with Dutch Masters."
