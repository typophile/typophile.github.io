body: "This is a typeface that I have been fiddling around for a long time. It has
  its roots in 19th century american printed ephemera, but it's not based on any particular
  font - it's more of a \"remix\" of different styles with some added twists.\r\n\r\nI
  have tried to make the outlines rough to get the same warm soft feeling that old
  ephemera has.\r\n\r\nI also have experimented in spacing the font more tightly than
  would have been possible with real wood type to get a more modern feel.\r\n\r\nI
  haven't yet really focused on spacing/kerning and even the basic character set isn't
  even completed yet.\r\n\r\nAny comments appreciated."

  body: "Intriguing. You might even try a clean version as well.\r\n\r\nThe ear of
    the g seems to get in the way a lot; maybe you should set something like \"ege\"
    and \"igi\" without the ear and with balanced letterspacing, and then design an
    ear that fits in."

  body: The serifs on some characters seem just a bit bigger than they need to be.
    The m & n especially. I think you could scale back their size slightly ( height)
    overall & get a more pleasant readable face without sacrificing style. Ornamented
    versions might be nice later too.
