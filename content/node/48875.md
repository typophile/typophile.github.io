  the new HP logo at the start of the ad. There is a comment about it on <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/\">Brand

  body: Of course, I realise that 'type' was cut originally by a punchcutter and not
    drawn at all. But would it be easier to draw type if you could draw it (I don't
    mean with a pen and tablet but actually drawing on the screen where the picture
    appears.) Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about again? Someone put me straight.

  body: I see lettering a lot on book covers lately. Seems like a movement away from
    the cold digital look. As for this HP stuff. If they really had all of it lettered
    it would have been great. But they just had every glyph drawn once and made a
    font out of it - and not very well.

  body: "Yeah, weird choice for a tech company. Anyway, is that button logo above
    new? Doesn't contextual glyphs in OpenType let you go crazy with the hand-drawn
    sort of stuff.\r\n\r\nI really meant the touchscreen stuff... will that replace
    the mouse for type design?"
