body: "i'm looking for a font that is an alternative to copperplate. i have a client
  for whom i'm designing a logo, and he feels that all the fonts i've shown thus far
  are too 'common.' (these included: requiem, didot, castellar, futura, among others.)
  he has asked for a 'clean, crisp, unique, formidable, stately' font. he particularly
  likes the font used for the french laundry logo (http://www.frenchlaundry.com/   click
  on 'menu + stories' then click 'menu'. unfortunately, i can't find it anywhere that's
  clear to view other than a downloadable menu.) i believe it's copperplate that has
  been modified. \r\ni have a feeling this is one of those cases where he needs to
  see many options and will (hopefully) fall in love eventually. i don't think a sans
  serif is appropriate. thanks for any direction to lesser known, well designed fonts."

  body: thanks for some great suggestions. i especially love the french foundry fonts,
    as well as beaufort medium, biondi and palormak (not ready.) the fontshop newsletters
    are great inspiration - thank you! given that my client will 'know it when he
    sees it' i think i'll present him with screen shots of many of these options.
