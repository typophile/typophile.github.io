  in a new corporate identity project. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have and examples
  of Eureka in use outside of books and student work to show my bosses. Has anyone
  out there used Eureka in an identity project, or any big corporate projects and
  have URLs or PDFs to share? I want to push for Eureka Sans and Serif paired together
  in this project."

    been used, that you can find at least, will make it more unique for your company. '

  body: "Robert Valentine used it in some old FLOR catalogs I have. Just the serif
    paired with Franklin Gothic (I think).\r\nwww.interface.com\r\n\r\nNot sure if
    they still use it, my catalogs are around 3-4 years old.\r\n\r\nAlso the defunct
    ONE magazine used both the serif and sans in their first 2 issues. You might be
    able to find copies on Ebay. They went under in 2002, so I don't think there are
    any digital examples of the magazine anymore."

  body: Oh. Those are both great examples if you can find them. You might also ask
    Stephen if they have any examples.
