  whole front and/or back. I see a lot of places online but they all seem to only

    shop, I guess. They can do anything I want, including printing around the shirt.

    someone near you, but I know the Maryland Sheep & Wool Festival uses someone local
    and their shirts are pretty good (I know, I have a lot of them!): you could email
    them at info@sheepandwool.com to see who they use.\r\n\r\nLinda"
