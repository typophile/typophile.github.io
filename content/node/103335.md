body: We are looking for sans sefic faces that are really spacially economical with
  as large an x-height as possible for setting the nutritional info on some food packaging
  we are designing. The packaging is subject to some very tight guidelines and we
  are looking for a face that has a large x-height, is spacially economical but is
  not a condensed face. Any suggestions are very welcome.

  body: "Brook, I assume you realize that an x-height can be <em>too</em> big. So
    if you really want to save space with no regard to readability you might as well
    just use all-caps!\r\n\r\nHowever, trying to satisfy your criteria, I would recommend
    this:\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/quadraat-headliner *\r\nIf that's too
    condensed, maybe this old thing from 1959:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wordshape/adora/\r\n\r\n*
    Although you'll have to track it looser for small setting.\r\n\r\nAlso consider
    Bell Centennial* and H&FJ's elusive Retina.\r\n\r\n* http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bell-centennial/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hrant, I was thinking Bell Centennial too. I have used it in text settings
    and it works well and is very clear at small sizes. First heard of it for text
    use at an Edward Tufte Information Seminar.

    not quite sure I understand your request in that you want a typeface that is spatially

    a condensed typeface, but not one that\u2019s condensed.\u201D Does a client on

  body: "A narrow x-height region (which is basically what \"condensed\" means) is
    only one way to save space. In fact the more paragraph breaks you have the more
    horizontal economy ends up going to waste. In contrast, a font with short extenders
    (read: wide and tall x-height) can be set at a smaller point size (without looking
    too small) and with tighter leading, resulting in <em>vertical</em> economy (irrespective
    of paragraph break frequency).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    of them are called \u201Ccondensed\u201D but all of them are very spacesaving.
    Perhaps one of the most common spacesaving sans serif is the FF Dax from Hans
