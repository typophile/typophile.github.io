  a really good font manager program?  Besides previewing installed fonts, I would
  also like to preview uninstalled fonts, if that is even possible..."

  body: It, of course, depends on your operating system. I use <a href="http://www.extensis.com/en/products/suitcasefusion2/index.jsp">Extensis
    Suitcase Fusion</a> for Mac and it's served me pretty well over the years. You
    may also consider <a href="http://www.fontexplorerx.com/">Font Explorer</a> from
    Linotype or <a href="http://www.insidersoftware.com/FA_pro4_details.php">FontAgent
    Pro</a> from Insider Software.

    Font Viewer and Cfont Pro.
