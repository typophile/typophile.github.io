		<div class="commentbody"><p>As originally developed, didones were size-specific (as indeed were all styles at the time), and that is the key to their sophistication: their delicacy is fine-tuned to each size, with purposefully small leeway for error in printing. If that takes higher quality, more time-consuming press-work, it may indeed be expensive and hence upscale, bourgeois and aristocratic, but ﬁne printing is not per se class-speciﬁc, it is the direction in which technology marches..</p>
<p>If anything, didones were over-sophisticated, as remarked by Richard Austin in his Imperial Foundry specimen of 1819:</p>
<blockquote>“The modern ... printing type at present in use was introduced by the French, about twenty years ago: the old shaped letters being capable of some improvement, it was judged expedient to re-model the alphabet to render them more agreeable to the improved state of printing…”</blockquote>
<p>He went on to address the issue of fragility:</p>
<blockquote>“…for how can it be expected that types cut nearly as thin as the edge of a razor can retain their form for any reasonable length of time, either to produce good work, or remunerate the Printer for his labour?</blockquote>
<blockquote>“The hair lines being now below the surface of the main strokes of the letters, the Printer, in order to get an impression of all parts of the face, is obliged to use a softer backing, and additional pressure. This … militates against all good printing; for in forcing the paper down to meet the depressed part of the face, it at the same time takes off the impression of part of the sides, as is evident from the ragged appearance of printing from such types.”</blockquote>
<p>Surely the difﬁculty in printing such types properly, and the complexity of their construction (with varying height of different glyph parts, according to their degree of delicacy) constitutes a sophisticated, i.e. complex, design?</p>
<p>The didone style was developed for ﬁne letterpress typography, and subsequently adapted for more general job work and other technologies, in which it does not sit quite so easily. It’s difﬁcult to work with, but not impossible. No risk, no reward.</p>

And just because something is more difficult to work with does not make it more functional. The other thing -which Bert alludes to- is that style is appreciable in proportion to size; a Didone is less of a Didone the smaller you get, and below a certain threshold is not a Didone at all.</p>
<p>Héctor: Of course. In fact there&rsquo;s no such thing as &ldquo;highest possible legibility&rdquo;. But a designer needs to know what he&rsquo;s breaking, how and why. For example in Patria I&rsquo;ve made the &ldquo;s&rdquo; (among other glyphs) too wide in terms of what I think is optimal readability, but I did so to promote a certain style. That&rsquo;s not the same saying &ldquo;I made it wide coz I like it and that&rsquo;s all that matters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I disagree. I have original 18th and 19th Century books in small size Didot types, and they are unmistakably Didone style. I think you are making the mistake of assuming that Didones are characterised by high contrast between hairline and main stems, but that characteristic is itself a function of size derived from a particular construction. The whole point of a Didone is that the hairline weight remains fairly constant independent of size, while the main stem weight varies according to size. So of course smaller sizes have lower contrast, <em>but that is precisely because they are Didones.</em></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@John: You are right of course, but only in so far that non-metal type lost that distinction… Apart from commendable recent efforts like the ITC Bodoni ‘numbered’ opticals, almost two generations were subjected to one-aspect didones for all sizes.</p>
<p>Another point I have to make: photoreproduction was not very kind to didones and such. The latest technologies in printing, like computer-to-plate and high res setting have made it possible to regain the field lost since the second world war.</p>

In the early 1990s, I achieved optical scaling in didone setting by mixing Bauer Bodoni at display and deck size with the sturdier Bauer Bodoni for body text. Later, in 2008, I published Scotch Modern, with several “optical” sizes.</p>
<p>However, the most impressive digital didone must surely be Hoefler’s Didot of 1991, for Fabien Baron at <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em>. Here it is still going strong 20 years later, leveraging the “constant hairline” property in mixed-size display setting, which is a key element of the magazine’s design:
