body: "I hate asking for help when it comes to finding a suitable font for my identity/resume.
  But the time has come where soon, and for unfortunate reasons, I can finally afford
  to buy something that compliments my mark. I've been using Gill Sans (I know...I
  KNOW!...)\r\n\r\nBut nothing I've found seems quite right. I want a geometric sans-serif
  that's versatile enough to work on my resume as well. I'ld like the typography next
  to the mark to read in UC or Caps/SmallCaps \"EVAN BROGAN or Evan Brogan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's
  the mark:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EflashSymbol_6073.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere
  was something about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle|Eagle]]which
  I liked, but the Uppercase G simply will not work, and I'm not a fan of the lower
  case A. And again there aren't enough weights.\r\n\r\nSome other ones I saw were
  [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro|Contax Pro]] (almost perfect,
  and enough weights, but that uppercase R just kills it), [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/itc-kabel|Kabel]]
  (not serious enough), [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/litera/|Litera]] (too geometric,
  in fact, with its perfectly rounded forms, and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-415|Geometric
  415]] (also very close to what I want but something seems off--maybe the contrast?).\r\n\r\nNone
  of these work quite right. I'm spent. Any suggestions?"

  body: "Hmm--I think that font is too choppy. Like Kabel it doesn't seem formal enough.\r\n\r\nI
    surely see the mark has a bit of a problem with that arrowhead, although it's
    never bothered me enough to change it any further, nor have I figured out how
    I would. But in any case as long as you mention it I'm curious how you might do
    so.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty happy with it so if I can fix it I shall, but for those
    others reading this, right now a font to complement is my greatest need."

    as the mark gets smaller.

  body: "Formal might not have the exact connotation. \r\n\r\nTry, authoritative.
    Clean and professional. Nothing too fancy or too fun.\r\n\r\nSomething that's
    I've also been looking for is the intersection of stems on letters like V & A
    coming together to form a point(to match the pointyness of my mark).\r\n\r\nI'll
    get back on this mark later this week--I've found my vector version differs from
    my jpgs...which may harken back to an unfortunate loss of data. The vector DEFINITELY
    has a left angle longer than the right. I corrected for it and produced the one
    we see here--which as you can see, the left angle is actually shorter than the
    right...What I'm thinking is, is that my typophile avatar was done before I corrected
    for it.\r\n\r\nTry shrinking down the original image I attached and tell me if
    you still see the problem."

    looks a little right on the large scale and a little left at smaller scales--so
    it must be optically center! I think it does look better than it did before.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your astuteness, Frode. It's all in the details, of course.\r\n\r\nNeutraface
    No 2 is on my wishlist, and something I definitely thought of. Little expensive
    at this point. When I can, I probably will go that route. Maybe in the meantime
    I'll pick up a few weights of Contax Pro.\r\n\r\nAt some point I'll begin posting
    my next problem--how to typeset my name next to this square. I love it as a mark,

    few weights of Contax Pro would be $80 (2 weights) - $120 (3 weights) whereas
    Neutra No. 2 is $150 for display (6 fonts) or $175 for text (8 fonts). I wouldn't
    waste my money on a font I didn't love, especially when the cost difference is
    that little."

  body: "I second what Frode says about your mark. It catches my eye every time I
    saw your avatar (in the sense that there\u2019s something wrong with it)\r\n\r\nI
    think you chose a very tricky form and despite the \u2018plain\u2019 look of your
    mark it is full of optical pitfalls.\r\n\r\nFor example, besides the vertical
    arrow on the slanted stem, which gives the whole shape a broken look, the thickness
    of your horizontal stem is (optically) far thicker than the diagonals.\r\nAlso,
    the horizontal line seems to sit way too low, since the head of your arrow optically
    reduces the lower part. This bottom-heaviness reduces your logo\u2019s dynamics
    and doesn\u2019t correspondent well with the \u2018propulsive\u2019 shape of a
    slanted lightning, IMHO"

  body: "Well yes the horizontal is a tad bit thicker because the arrow is going to
    be so weighted. The zig-zag looks way too fragile otherwise, and this looks better
    than that from my explorations. I might try narrowing the horizontal slightly,
    but the previous explanation still applies. A slanted arrow is simply not what
    I'm looking for, either.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say anything is \"at such a late stage;\"
    the mark has been needing a suitable typeface for a while, and had been in the
    process of designing for quite a long time. My issue was whether to keep the thing
    in a box or simply to reverse colors from what you see here (which would make
    typesetting a bit easier).\r\n\r\nBecause this is more of a feeling for me than
    anything I can state concretely, I'll graciously accept the input, but that goes
    in a direction I'm just not happy with. The logo grew out of how I sign the E
    in my name (one reason that slanted arrow would never work for me, and another
    reason why the whole thing sitting low is just fine with me). Whether or not one
    ever made that connection is of little importance--I don't really expect one would.
    The important thing to me is that I can see myself in it. What more can one ask
    for in a personal mark?\r\n"
