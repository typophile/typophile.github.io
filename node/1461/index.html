<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Inspired by ATypI, I'd like to get a list of things (items, notes) together that pinpoint the gaping holes that exist in the education of design students, specifically (and only) about what it means to own type. For instance, the most obvious being that just because it is on your machine doesn't mean you own it. <br> <br>Let me state that this is not the place for discussion. I wish to start another thread for this. Not yet, but soon. I'd first like to form a general picture.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, <br> <br>I agree with you completely. <br> <br>Get this--In my first typography class, the teacher actually distributed a cd with the entire Adobe type collection, as well as hundreds of others from various foundries. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I thought it was interesting that (name withheld) said she (basically) has a "don't ask, don't tell" policy in her typography class regarding where students get their typefaces. <br> <br>The other interesting tidbit was that Bill Davis from Agfa/Monotype said it took a long time to convince FAST (a British anti-piracy group) that fonts were software that deserved to be protected. <br> <br>I've been thinking about this, too (it's a long drive from Vancouver to Portland :o). I have many more comments, but I'm not sure how to keep this from being a discussion. I look forward to your future thread. <br> <br><i>Post edited by Thread Moderator.</i></div>

<div class=commentbody>Jay and everyone -- Let's just have the discussion in here. I can tell that it will be difficult to just post lists without actually saying anything. I had that problem myself. <br> <br>Another thing, let's keep names out of this if it involves a personal negative slant. Meaning a person, not a company. My point is not to create a witch list. <br> <br>I had one foundry owner actually tell me at ATypI, that students shouldn't be held responsible, but that they should simply start buying type, and owning their type, once they begin in the professional world. <br> <br>However, could I ask within your posts that you <b>make bold</b> the main points (or list items).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe the letterror guys could build a font that self-destructs when you get your diploma. That's not too much to ask, is it? <br> <br>Today's student is tomorrow's font customer. But I agree - more emphasis needs to be placed on owning the fonts you use. Ultimately it's in the hands of the University to drive this point home. Foundries can't be expected to give out free student licenses, but have there been any success stories around <b>student licenses with reduced pricing/limited-use EULAs?</b> <br> <br>Another issue to add to the type education of students: <b>Understanding the relationship between a font license and the # of computers it can be legally installed to.</b> Many professionals are fuzzy on this as well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jared -- how about pre-destructed fonts for students? Reflect the "a", rotate the "e", etc... IOW, create fonts that are perfectly usable for the teaching of typography, but not usable in a professional setting. A CD could be provided to the teacher, along w/ a canned message about how destructive piracy is. <br> <br>Yes, people could download a pirate copy of fontographer and "fix" the fonts ... but that requires a whole lot more volition than just burning a CD. "I didn't know it was wrong" wouldn't be a valid defense if someone was caught.</div>

<div class=commentbody>An interesting idea, but one that I fear might not fly - as students are using the type to create portfolio projects, which eventually end up in front of a potential employer when they're fresh out of school. As a student, I'd prefer to do the typo-flipping myself, if it supported whatever typographic concept I was designing. <br> <br>I like the idea of watermarking, though. But what's the appropriate way to go about it? <br> <br>Most of the issue boils down to educators pushing the ethics of using fonts. I can't remember who said that every design student should be required to design & build one font before graduating - that will teach them to think twice before pirating fonts. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Jared -- is that an issue? Many of my student projects had "lorem ipsum" for body copy, rubbed down from letraset sheets. (Some of them in Souvenier!) <br> <br>JPF -- exactly so. It's like leading a bunch of children to a candy store, then giving them a stick to chew on. It would be a sin to restrict students to 10 typefaces, but it's impossible for them to purchase fonts on student budgets, and it's illegal to "share" them. Since the probability of getting caught is nil, guess what happens.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany -- <br> <br>I'm still trying to get my thoughts into bullet points. Here's what I have so far: <br> <br><b>Education (a):</b> I love the plaintive cries of the people sued by the RIAA:"I paid for Kazaa, how can using it be illegal?" Do people actually understand that "sharing" fonts is illegal? <br> <br><b>Education (b):</b> If most people can't (or don't bother to) make their tenses agree in their writing, how can they be expected to care about proper typography? "What's wrong with Ariel?" Getting people to care about the essential role of good typography in written communication is necessary before you can get them to care about the value (therefor ownership) of fonts. <br> <br><b>Carrot:</b> It'd be really nice if people would stop stealing fonts, but what do we offer as an incentive? Warm fuzzies are great in Church or around a camp-fire, but I don't know that you can use them to motivate people in the real world. Teaching ethics is essential, but I also think there needs to be a tangible reward for complying w/ IP laws (i.e. actually purchasing fonts vs. "borrowing" them). <br> <br><b>Stick:</b> Let's face it, if you know you aren't going to get caught, are you going to steal candy from the unguarded candy jar? Especially if it's a magic candy jar, that automatically re-fills each time a piece of candy is removed? I think the RIAA went <i>way</i> over the top ... but if they hadn't gone that far, would they have gotten so much ink? There needs to be some realistic possibility of getting caught if IP laws are going to have any effect. <br> <br> -/-/- <br> <br>I keep going back to Bringhurst's comment in his AtypI keynote speech:"...software in its natural state is invisible." The task is to convince font users that something invisible has value. If something has no value, how can it be stolen? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello. My name is Tiffany Wardle and I am a Typoholic. <br> <br>----- <br> <br>In many instances below, when I use the word "you", I'm talking to the populace in general. <br> <br>Jay -- I'm not sure I understand your <b>carrot</b> idea. Do you mean to say that type user's should be rewarded for not stealing fonts? I disagree with this. The reward is the fact that you haven't stolen property from another and you now own (or rather have licensed) another typeface. And I'm afraid again it goes back to how you were raised. I'm sure our parents and guardians didn't say to us, "no one is looking, go steal some candy because I'm not buying it for you." <br> <br>Hrant just posted, "How can you do that when the religion of Capitalism teaches just the <br>opposite?" <br> <br>We can rationalize all we want, but type designer's spend time on the type they produce. Capitalist's understand that time is money. Something that took time to produce must be worth something. And for those of us that consider ourselves to "know great type (or design) when we see it", it is unfair of us to want great looking type for free. Or worse to think we deserve great type for free. And worse still to say we deserve X amount per hour and then have the nerve not to pay for a $40 dollar typeface. <br> <br>----- <br> <br>We should start a 12-Step Program For Font Addicts. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, I'm not condoning font piracy, what I'm saying is that the core is rotten - you can't build anything of real value on it. Capitalism (which however like any system doesn't exist in a pure state) teaches the consumer to value physical things. Culture loses out. Type is mostly culture. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't think there is only one "core". I think every human being has their own "core" as well as their own abilities to choose right from wrong, or to think for themselves. Yes, I suppose it is easier to just "go with the flow", but what a boring world this would be if we didn't have people that actually think for themselves. Designers are human. No matter how much black and titanium they manage to surround themselves with. They have brains. Especially if they have the ability to run a business.

<div class=commentbody>No way - I always maintain that people are generally decent at heart. <br> <br>But they're also <i>human</i>, and generally susceptible to corruption, through TV (and even formal education). <br>People are largely products of their environment, and this environment is not conducive to cultural progress. <br> <br>I'm not saying all of us should become martyrs.

<div class=commentbody>Ok. I don't disagree with that. Human's are susceptible to corruption, but that is a statement about education. So, therefore, if someone is susceptible to corruption, it stands to reason that they might also be susceptible to incorruption. Or at least given the tools, through education, to become more or less incorruptible. We are humans, we are not, nor will we ever be perfect. But, we can learn right from wrong, make the right choice, and improve ourselves. <br> <br>------------ <br> <br>When I say education, I'm not only thinking of students. I'm thinking of font users in general. So, it is one thing to offer student's type licenses for less money, but what happens when they go out into the "real" world. Have they been given the wrong idea about how inexpensive fonts can be? <br> <br>-- <br> <br>And what do you all think about free fonts? Genuinely free, licensed as such. For instance, those you can find at Astigmatic?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't see why students shouldn't be expected to pay for fonts. Don't they pay for textbooks and other supplies? They buy paper, brushes, t-squares, computer equipment -- why not fonts? I think student pricing is a good idea -- make it possible for them to purchase the fonts, and by the time they graduate they'll be used to the idea that fonts cost money, just as all their other equipment does. <br> <br>Perhaps design schools should have a "starter" set of required typefaces (just as they require certain textbooks and other supplies). <br> <br>BJ, I like your "Fonts Are People Too" campaign idea. I can see it as a web graphic (like the <a href=http://www.gag.org/about/ask_first.php target=_blank>"Ask First"</a> campaign to combat artwork piracy), t-shirt, etc.</div>

If the only reason to stop is a negative ("If you don't stop we will sue you"), it might stop a few people, but it will also engender a lot of ill-will and drive the practice underground. (Something I wonder about, but have no info: how many people have read the news articles about the actions of the RIAA and said:"Kazaa? What's that? Cool! Where can I find it?") <br> <br>Stopping the bleeding won't be easy: there are too many fonts out there, and they can't be recalled or disabled. Most students, and most start-up designers, exist on a bare-bones budget. Encouraging them to spend money for fonts ("Hmmm, Meta or Beer? Wow, that's a really tough choice!") is going to be very difficult. <br> <br>The carrot doesn't have to be expensive. This is not a fully thought out action-plan, but here's a scenario: Provide design teachers w/ a CD full of exploded fonts (discussed above). Enclose on the CD bios of the font designers, descriptions of the fonts & suggestions for proper usage, & a discount coupon for unexploded versions of the font. Font designers get visibility (for marketing purposes, and to put a face on the victim of font piracy); students get new, interesting fonts to work with, teachers get tools & opportunity to talk about piracy & why it's a Bad Thing. <br> <br> <br>>We should start a 12-Step Program For Font Addicts. <br> <br>Why? They taste good, they are good for you, and they don't cause cancer! <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The education of "font users" is one thing, but it seems to me that alot of design schools are trying to get by on the cheap. <br> <br>The design department should decide on a group of fonts that the typography and graphic design courses will use. They should buy the appropriate licenses, put them on a central server, and use Font Reserve or another such font manager to manage them on the network. <br> <br>Require all students to purchase a notebook computer with the appropriate software and core fonts pre-configured. Along with a wireless network card of some sort. Apple works with educators on this point. Students use the core fonts for projects and can access the centrally managed fonts from the server if they need them. <br> <br>I just started teaching an undergraduate digital lettering course at Parsons School of Design, and this is pretty much how they run it. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with the school licensing concept. It'd be nice if foundries offered highly discounted site licenses for education facilities for the sole use of students. <br> <br>Our school had an OK library of faces, and we were encouraged to purchase our own faces as we wanted them. <br> <br>Do realize that art students are constantly buying materials as it is. So, I can't blame then for not forking over $100 for a typeface to set a headline in their fake magazine comp. In addition, art departments don't tend to get the same corporate donations of software and equipment that the more prolific (in terms of making money in the real world) departments receive.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I didn't say "highly discounted". <br> <br>The school design department negotiates licenses (discounted or not, depending on the foundry) to create a "professional" type of library for the students taking the courses given. <br> <br>This library should be diverse enough to allow students to complete the majority of their work, if not all of it. If a student really needs that special typeface that all the cool art directors are using. They can licensed it on their own for the full price. <br> <br>That way they get the 'real world" experience of balancing their desire to follow their design heros into the next trend, with the bottom line of being limited to what they can afford. <br> <br>It seems to me that the real education should go to some of those department chairs to authorize this kind of 'font expenditure".</div>

<div class=commentbody>Meredith: <br>>Perhaps design schools should have a "starter" set of required typefaces ... <br> <br>Adobe offers its "Type Classics for Learning", 400 fonts for $99. A good deal any way you look at it, from a type designer's standpoint it has 2 problems: 1) It's from Adobe, which pepetuates the concept that fonts are "system software", put out by the Big Software Companies; and 2) Nick Shinn has called it "Dumping" by Adobe: they can afford to take a loss on certain fonts to build up market share. <br> <br>James: <br>>It seems to me that the real education should go to some of those department chairs ... <br> <br>Hmm. That brings up another subject: how many schools teach anything like "computer ethics?" Because this is not just a font issue, this is an everything issue. If students were given the option between buying a $100 textbook or paying $15 for a pdf of the textbook, what would they do? They'd copy the pdf from a friend. <br> <br>I like the idea of a school-owned library of fonts for use by the students. Usage could be contingent on the student agreeing not to pirate fonts?</div>

<div class=commentbody>>alot of design schools are trying to get by on the cheap. <br> <br>I think James is hitting it right on the head here. I've been trying to get my school to buy a decent font collection - even if only for two or three "type specific" labs - for nigh on three years now. We just had a good instructor quit over the lack of type and the beaurocratic hoops you have to jump through to [not] get it. <br> <br>And the closest we got was our bookstore selling the dubious FontSite CD. :-/ <br> <br>>forking over $100 for a typeface to set a headline in their fake magazine comp. <br> <br>I also agree with darrel on this point. If a student won't even fork over $400 or so for the entire Adobe Design Collection, there's no way they'll fork over the cash for a single font. Not when their PC comes with TNR and Arial. <br> <br>IMHO, the real issue lies with the schools - not with foundries. I think the schools should be held responsible for buying decent font collections (i.e., providing resources for the students) - rather than the foundries having to undervalue their products.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>student licenses with reduced pricing/limited-use EULAs? <br> <br>>Perhaps design schools should have a "starter" set <br> <br>We have had a student "P22 Type-Lab pack" in the works for a little while. We are pretty close to releasing it. The specifics will be announced soon, but essentially it is a pre-selected collection of 22 fonts licensed for 25 seats at a price that is not "dumping" but definitely a decent deal. It would be offered only to school labs. The fonts would not be "exploded" or crippled in any way, but rather named in a way that made it clear they were part of the lab's resources. We also have yet to finish the modified EULA, but even more important right now is the text files that explain the history of the fonts. I think there is some good discussion here about the educating students (and designers) about proper font usage and licensing. I would like to add additional explanations of the licensing issues to our "read me" file (but who actually reads those?.) <br>Any design instructor who would like to contact me directly about our EDU pack, please do, The final details have yet to be hammered out, and I would be glad to entertain feedback on this. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The general attitude is one of entitlement as <br>many students (I didn't say all) are "poor" and <br>feel the fonts should be theirs because <br>they could never afford them. <br> <br>This however holds little water.

<div class=commentbody>Hmm... I'm still thinking on the free fonts thing. If people are willing to do the work for free, that makes it a hobby, not a profession. But some people build boats as a hobby, others are professional boat builders. <br> <br>I can understand that some fonts are worth developing for the sheer fun of it, but they aren't worth the extra effort needed to finish them to a "sellable" state. <br> <br>I'm wondering why there is such a jump between free fonts and fonts that cost $20 per face.

<div class=commentbody>Just read this (not fonts, but file sharing in general): <br> <br><a href=http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0%2C1412%2C60613%2C00.html target=_blank>http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,60613,00.html</a> <br> <br>This is a sample of what I thing of as "carrot and stick." The carrot is that students get access to broadband. In order to get the access, they have to agree to abstain from illegal file sharing. If they try to file-share, they get smacked with the stick -- immediately. If they try again, they get smacked harder. If they try a third time, they get kicked off the network. <br> <br>The second page has a link to the Electronic Freedom foundation, <a href=http://www.eff.org/ target=_blank>http://www.eff.org/</a> . It's kind of disheartening; since we (designers, producers & vendors of type) are interested in the reduction of software piracy, we aparently are in league with "... governments and corporate interests worldwide [who] are trying to prevent us from communicating freely through new technologies, just as when those in positions of power controlled the production and distribution of -- or even burned -- books they did not want people to read in the Middle Ages." <br> <br>[Sigh] <br></div>
