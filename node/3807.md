  &#34;ij&#34; ligature &#40;x0133 Unicode&#41; an atomic element considered linguistically
  distinct from the sequence i-j &#40;as &#34;ae&#34; is in Icelandic, I think&#41;,
  or is it simply a typographic ligature &#40;as are the &#34;fi&#34; and &#34;fl&#34;
  we know so well in English&#41;? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Brent'

  body: I&#39;m not a Dutch expert, but I&#39;ve been told that yes, it&#39;s a real
    character &#40;like ae and oe&#41; rather than a typographic nicety &#40;like
    fi and fl&#41;. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Yes, it is atomic. When letterspaced, it should appear as in R IJ N N, and
    when set vertically as in <BR> <BR>R <BR>IJ <BR>N <BR>N

  body: see <a href="http://rudhar.com/lingtics/nlij_en.htm" target="_blank">http://rudhar.com/lingtics/nlij_en.htm</a>
    for a discussion. The status of this letter is not well described. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    like to add that the main reason I see why it is not much used, is because most
    type writers &#40;and most computer keyboards&#41; do not support it or through
    a difficult key sequence. Neither the upper case nor the lower case character
    is present in iso-8859-1, the character set we&#39;re supposed to be happy with
    in the Netherlands :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Most people simply type ij, but this poses
    a problem in sorting. <BR>

  body: 'Let me ask a somewhat related question: <BR>I&#39;ve read &#40;I don&#39;t
    remember where&#41; that Dutch can mark syllable inflection through the use of
    the acute accent &#40;sort of like italics for emphasis, but for single vowels&#41;.
    Is this true? If so, why is it not used much? And would it mean we&#39;d need
    to have a &#34;j-acute&#34;?! &#40;If the &#34;ij&#34; is indeed atomic.&#41;

    acute optically centered above them.

    &#42;could&#42; be three acuted in raw.

  body: Hrant, that is just how I was taught to do it, and there is something very
    satisfying about writing it. But then I&#39;m not Dutch. Do you know of where
    I could see a sample of Pascal with the ij lig?
