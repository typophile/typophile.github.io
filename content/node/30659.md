  font. I watched the film the other night and loved the typeface too. The sample
  ktz found did look hand drawn - but I think there must be a mechanical version,
  check out the attached sample I came accross. Can anyone have another go at identifying
  this for us?\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\nDom"

  body: "Upon first glance, I'd say it's a custom Futura (based on the A, U, L, N,
    F, E, T, and R) but the S is closer to a grotesk than a geometric, and the M just
    looks strange.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Thanks Lex. The M is my favourite character. Not so sure about the dot on
    the letter i mind you. I still think it might be a font as opposed to a basterdised
    version of Futura since it was probably made in the 60's and I wouldn't have thought
    they'd muck about with existing fonts in those days as much as people to today.

  body: "No, I dig the wilfulness of the I and the wrongness of the M, I love this.\r\n\r\nI
    really doubt it is futura, to me the L and the E look too condensed, the S is
    different, the C is different, the numerals don't work either, I wonder why you'd
    change a font this much when it wouldn't seem like too much trouble to produce
    your own. \r\n\r\nI really like this, did I say that already?\r\n\r\n--N"

    Thanks for link to Bande \xE0 part Stephen. Maybe he collaborated consistently
    with a specific typographer, they kind of feel like they were designed by the
    same person?\r\n\r\nDom"

  body: I think the Mann got it. It's just right, down to the numerals. All you need
    to do is snip the 'M' and add a dot to the cap 'I's.

  body: "jeez, talk about WAY late to this conversation \u2014 wish I had known earlier!\r\n\r\nThis
    typeface was actually completely hand-drawn, though, may have been based off of
    another typeface from the era. That being said, I haven't been able to find any
    evidence that it was nor have I been able to find any evidence as to who actually
    did draw this typeface for the film. Going out on a limb, thus far my guess is
    that it was either Godard's editor Agnes Guillemot, some random, uncredited genius,
    or Godard himself (which I'm not discounting).  \r\n\r\nI'm actually in the midst
    of creating a typeface inspired by the these titles in masculin-feminin (in my
    free time, so it is taking a while). During my research, I found out that Godard
    was actually the nephew of Maximilien Vox\u2014who was still alive during the
    production of these films, so perhaps he played a role as well. I got in touch
    with Godard's production company in search of the truth, but have yet to hear
    back....but will keep trying.\r\n\r\nAttached an images from my typeface that
    is in the works...hopefully coming sooner rather than later!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/agnes_5_4626.gif]"
