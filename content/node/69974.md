  has noticed that there are two characters not displaying correctly when setting
  text in Azerbaijani.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the pic you can see the text that I copied
  from a website in blue at the top. The text is then pasted into the metrics window.
  The two missing glyphs are at the beginning of the text: /uni04D8 and /afii10846.
  The glyphs are replaced by question marks in my typeface, but also in any open installed
  font like Arno Pro or Helvetica World.\r\n\r\nThese characters are in the Windows
  Cyrillic Asian codepage, but which available codepage supports that character set?\r\n\r\nBasically
  - how can I get it to work properly?\r\n\r\nThanks for any replies."

    using the Cyrillic Schwa codepoints, but on the website they probably use the

    replace the existing /uni04D8 and /afii10846 glyphs or be added to the character
    set - I don't suppose it would do any harm to have all four?\r\n\r\nBTW - where
    did you get that information? is it on a codepage, and if so, which one?"

  body: "That would depend on which languages/scripts you intend to support.\r\n\r\nIf
    a font supports Azerbaijani in the Latin alphabet, it should include 018F and
    0259. If it supports Azerbaijani in the Cyrillic alphabet it should include 04D8
    and 04D9. If it supports both scripts, it should include all four. If the font
    doesn't otherwise contain cyrillic glyphs, including 04D8 and 04D9 would be rather
    pointless.\r\n\r\nThe information is all available from <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/charts/\">the
    Unicode Consortium</a>.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    I can't really just add the two extra characters and hope for the best. I would
    really need to add the whole Latin Extended B codepage. Which I hadn't planned
    to do at all!\r\n\r\nDo I just suggest using the Cyrillic keyboard instead of

    Ha ha, that's funny Nick \u2013 I seriously doubt it, but my client is Romanian
    (and they pay incredibly promptly!), while their client (I presume) is Azerbaijani.\r\n"

  body: "I wouldn't think in terms of unicode blocks, but rather of *languages*. After
    all, the set of languages included in any given unicode block is rather arbitrary
    and there's no real reason to allow that to dictate your language support choices.
    If your client is (indirectly) Azerbaijani, you'd want to ensure you include the
    latin and/or cyrillic characters necessary to meet their needs. That certainly
    doesn't include all the characters in latin extended B or IPA extensions. Schwa
    (018F/0259) is the only character in these blocks needed to support Azerbaijani,
    and since the web page you show above is clearly in the Latin script, you'd definitely
    want to include this.\r\n\r\nA cyrillic keyboard would only be appropriate for
    Azerbaijani written in cyrillic (which the client would likely want as well) --
    in which case you'd need to to include the standard cyrillic characters along
    with schwa (04D8/04D9), \u0492 (0492/0493), \u0408 (0408/0458), \u049C (049C/049D),
    \u04E8 (04E8/04E9), \u04AE (04AE/04EF), \u04BA (04BA/04BB), \u04B8 (04B8/04B9).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
