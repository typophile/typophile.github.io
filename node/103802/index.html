		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, but on reﬂection I’m not sure diaphanous is the right description—I just had a quick look at the link above, on my iPhone. On further examination, most of the page designs are quite ﬂat and solid, although the use of Helvetica 35 does have a bit of a “see through” quality.

Perhaps the use of such a light typeface is because “now we can”, with the high-res screen.

That was certainly the case for the implementation of Helvetica 35 twenty years ago in print, when direct-to-plate output enabled high res printing of thin types at small size, without the attrition that occurs in photographic pre-press production.

Yes I think that was his intention. 

A significant percentage of iPhone users are female, so a less masculine look certainly isn't out of place. Some of the type seems a little light to me, but it's hard to judge from screen shots, we'll need to see how they look on an actual iPhone.

> most of the page designs are quite ﬂat...

Definitely a move toward "flat design", which is a current trend in interface design, although interestingly Apple has also added a 3D effect. The phone's sensors know when it's being rotated and they rotate the background in response, creating the effect that the icons are floating in front of the background. You can see the animation effect here:

If I had seen iOS 7 previews a few months ago, I would have held off on upgrading to an iPhone 5. If it actually ships like this I may run for the hills. Helvetica is anti-legibility enough without going out of their way to make it worse.</div>

Regarding the 35 weight, I was always taught that the more you notice the features of a font, rather than the words and the feeling of the words, then the font has failed. Helvetica is supposed to be one of the most transparent, "don't look at me" fonts in existence, which is why I assume it's been chosen as the font du jour. But using the light weight kills that premise.</div>

You must be referring to this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalkboard_%28typeface%29

I have to doubt that Apple didn't make a clone for ethical reasons. But most of all, the proper way to do this is commissioning original custom type, like MS has done. But oh, I forgot, Apple is pretty cash-strapped these days... With all its faults, MS still respects type -and reading- more than any other large company I can think of. And that's what type designers should hold up as model behavior - as opposed to Luisel Ramos.

I guess even the smartest people are not immune to the blinding light of brand loyalty.

You're a human who errs, just like me. Your disregard for the typographic good MS has been doing versus the typographic pillaging Apple has been doing is clear proof of that. And if you think I'm the only one who believes that, that would be another way you err, another way your hubris is misplaced (as it always is for any human).

And, yes... Hrant, I agree with you completely, there is no way to commission a font like Comic Sans, one just has to wait for that lucky day, (or pick from the 1000s of such fonts available). But Helvetica, that's a different clone altogether. 

I also agree that some customer loyalty is blind, but I'm a type designer, and I look at these issues with a certain certainty I'm sure is beyond the usual blindly loyal customer. Your Ive thing is also quite distasteful. He's another person in a long lone of same, you don't know, but pretend too, oh so well. Faced by him, you'd run.</div>

I agree, and also shy. I don't think he's ever gotten on stage to make a presentation at an Apple keynote; instead they always show a video of him. 

> he had to work with Jobs for a decade

True but Steve Jobs' wife said once that Steve was always careful not to say anything "hurtful" to Ive. My guess is that Jobs thought that Ive was too shy to take the withering comments that Jobs was famous for.

		<div class="commentbody">The only way there's not at least a hint of denial here is if one simply hasn't seen the deluge of discontent. I certainly agree that people go out of their way to complain (yes, especially about a UI) and I'm all for abrupt shifts for the better. But this is quite a bit more than the usually expected negative whining; people who would normally give Apple the benefit of the doubt aren't being able to do that any more. And actually I think that's good news.

But really, I'm not fixated on public opinion here - I could even grow to like those gaudy gradations that designers [are taught to] hate. I just believe that the appreciation of how type works is totally lacking; letterforms are being treated as just another decorative element, not vessels of language. This is the classic Modernist delusion, which results for example in the infamous gray rectangles I hope most designers now know to avoid.

Let me ask this: would it be shocking if Ive really doesn't get typography? But I don't believe in demonizing individuals; it's the "process" that gives a celebrity a job he can't handle that's the real culprit.

		<div class="commentbody">Certainly bigger targets cause more people to take shots. But, again, it's the <em>kind</em> of people complaining that's telling (and encouraging for the future).

And I don't think being flippant helps anything. It reminds me of the ~2 day period when, if you asked Siri "What's the best smartphone?" it would reply "Nokia Lumia 900", but then Apple hijacked that and got it to reply things like "Are there other smartphones?" :-/  Denial, flippant or not, is not honorable. Apple is just another underhanded, greedy corporation. It's not special. And that's my point. The reason <em>I</em> complain is that casting Apple as some sort of savior saint -a perception no other tech company has ever had AFAIK- does a disservice to everybody.

But really, it's all about context: at least on Typophile, our loyalty to type should take precedence over loyalty to a brand. Denying that iOS7's typography is a regression only helps Apple shareholders, and only in the short term.

		<div class="commentbody">It's easy to forget that many Apple products got bad reviews from bloggers when first released. For example:

• When Steve Jobs unveiled the first iMac, many bloggers were shocked that it didn't have a floppy drive (very unusual back then) and there were many outraged articles even at Apple fan sites.

• That antenna problem with iPhones a few years ago led to many angry editorials, but it eventually blew over and the phone sold well. (I had one of those models and never had problems.)

• When the iPad was first released, there were numerous editorials that no one would buy it because "iPad" sounded like a sanitary napkin. Seriously, some people were really upset; some of those articles can still be Googled. People also said it was ugly, or was just an oversized iPod Touch. But it went on to be a huge success.

I agree that the new interface needs some work, but it's a beta for heaven's sake. And bloggers know that outraged articles about Apple get hits. Let's see how this all pans out when the tweaked version is released in the fall.

		<div class="commentbody">Good points. However the antenna problem -something Nokia and Blackberry had actually made public technical knowledge long ago- shouldn't be minimized, especially since it was another Ive form-over-function manifestation; and it's certainly ironic that his pretty design ended up having to be hidden under gaudy third-party covers. Also concerning the antenna: it ended up exposing the deceptive way the iPhone's signal strength indicator was set up. It's all an issue of trust, and I for one can't get myself to develop any...

One other thing: I don't at all think market success equates to social merit.

Now, if the release version of iOS7 is typographically improved, I mean improved <em>enough</em>, then to me that's actually even better than getting it right from the beginning, because it means Apple is listening.

And if your gripe is Helvetica, that's valid. But that said, I don't think any underhanded, greedy corporations were brought to their knees due to choosing to use Helvetica.

It popped up circa 2000, often oversize and gradient-happy, on a lot of beauty products, hair salons, day spas and so on, certainly here in Stockholm. In fact, that's what I'd think of too when seeing that weight of Helvetica, just as the regular (and especially medium) one evokes swiss design or simple 60s signage.</div>

I would hate to read a large body of text set in it but that is not an issue as most web content I look at is not rendered in it and I read iBooks in Georgia, Iowan or Athelas. Most things I read on screen are set in Verdana or Georgia and they are just dandy (for me)!

What is currently bugging me is the very weak design of the battery symbol. I have no problem with flat design (done well) but at the moment it feels like there is an art director with a bunch of designers and developers interpreting a brief but with very different ideas about how to do that. It is in beta, granted but when I am in the camera, mail or note apps I feel like I am on completely different devices, sometimes at odds with each other. That lack of cohesion bugs me a lot.</div>

For me, I’d like to be able to catch the date with as little as effort as possible, say, from the bottom of a purse in a dimly lit room while looking through the bottom portion of my glasses which creates a bit of distortion. Out of curiosity, why did you select ultra light and not bold?

Re battery, outline/space between the outline and the colour seems too thin. Again, with less than perfect vision, it blurs together. Should be an absolutely easy instant glance. Have a look at the battery icon on your Mac OS (I am on 18.8.3). There are curved ends to elude to three dimensions. If you don’t care for 3D, and want to go flat, go flat and ditch your rounded corners entirely. Presently you appear to be sitting on the fence and have not made a confidant decision in to go in either direction.

Chris, why are you discussing this as if it is my choice? I did not design the UI and I do not work for Apple. I supplied a screen grab from the iOS7 beta running on my iPhone5 with a black background to show (anyone interested) what that contrast is like compared with publicity shots available elsewhere. I could not care less how this effects <em>your</em> ability to view the screen from the bottom of your handbag, take that up with Apple.

I have no say in Apple's UI design choices but display accessibility in general (excluding my personal requirements and preferences, which is all I have commented on) is very important to me.

<blockquote>Have a look at the battery icon on your Mac OS (I am on 18.8.3)</blockquote>

Impressive beta access :-) I am currently only on 10.8.4 and spend more time than I would like looking at the battery icon and percentage, which are better than iOS7 but still far from pleasing.</div>

You have the wrong end of the fence but that aside, if I was designing a UI, this is the direction I would take with the battery icons, along with optional text to indicate either the percentage or time remaining.

James: In fact, there is a new typographic feature in iOS 7 called "Dynamic Type". The claims include "automatically adjusting font-weight, letter-spacing and leading for each font size." So this "Top Level", UI stuff, with subtle weight changes "on request", seems like the tip of an iceberg we can all find coolness in, assuming we're users. 

Overly light type is so serious a problem in other places, it's been spawning reading studies at the speed of blight. So, maybe this development can once again lead the way to efforts elsewhere.</div>

Hey, you know what would be a popcorn-worthy, heartrending light-show? If somebody harped on Apple to get them to commission a proper custom solution from Font Bureau...

Sad to watch this self-subversion of intellect.

And that's not all, the spec is using <em>"points"</em> to refer to type size! which is perhaps moving screen type sizing away from this foobar ;)

I'm not even a big fan of that style of type, but it's still leagues ahead.
