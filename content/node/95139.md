  body: "Hey Gabe,\r\n\r\nI'm a fan of Christian Schwartz, the designer of Giorgio
    Sans, and admired the typeface when it was released. The distinctive R and relatively
    closed S stayed with me.\r\n\r\nMarc"

  body: Finally, got the answer. It's MK12 Chadwick, as easy as go to [[http://telephoneme.tv/|telephoneme.tv]]
    (official website) then click on the "DOWNLOAD FONT" button under big title! So
    it's definitely an exclusive type for this film.
