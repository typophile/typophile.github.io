  themed. Any Indonesia/Bali ideas?

  body: "Usually, for things like this, lately people have tended to use typefaces
    like Ondine or even (shudder) Papyrus.\r\n\r\nSo, when it comes to the dull boring
    choices that have been overused, some other choices are\r\n\r\nSlogan\r\nNeuland\r\nLegend\r\nMistral\r\n\r\nFor
    an <em>authentic</em> choice, though, some Googling located [[http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-55992.html|Padma]],
    by Masuraj Sudana.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Padma-Typeface/798617]]\r\n\r\nis
    another link.\r\n\r\nFor Indonesia, there's FTF Indonesiana Serif Sketch by [[http://fizzeticatypefoundry.storenvy.com/|Fizzetica
    Type Foundry]], and Tanah Air Beta."

  body: If you really want to go the route of using a Latin script typeface to evoke
    a non-Latin culture, then my vote would certainly be for Padma. Note, however,
    that none of the types suggested in this thread are appropriate for continuous
    text, so you's want to limit something like Padma to headlines and other display
    use, and select a Latin text face that harmonises well with it.

    face too, just much more subtly. Looking at Padma (which I also like) I was immediately
    reminded of Papassissa's \"Dr Jekyll & Miss Hyde\":\r\nhttp://www.typefacedesign.org/resources/A5specimen/2012/ElenaPapassissa_Dr%20Jekyll%20and%20Miss%20Hyde_Specimen.pdf\r\nhttp://www.typefacedesign.org/2012/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    available to license.
