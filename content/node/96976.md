  this forum. I can't figure out the font of the logo here, it looks very familiar,
  but I can't remember the name. I hope someone can help me. I need to recreate this
  logo in a higher resolution and I don't want to trace the logo if I can find the
  font :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! :D\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fsglogo_5834.jpg]"
