body: The tag line is Jacoby Black but what&#39;s the font used for Shark Tale?. At
  first I thought it was Swiss 721 Black but the S indicates otherwise... any help
  would be most appreciated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/54874.jpg"

    I have to agree with you on that one Yves.

    is so my kind of logo - it WORKS. Shame the graphic design\r\nestablishment ridicules
    this type of thing. FedEx logo my tailfin.\r\n(I might lose the teeth though -
    especially since in the case of\r\nlo-fi rendering they'd look like the shark
    has wobbly lips...)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    does the potential look of a logo affect the actual choice of name. This would
    be a great case of that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "In more shark logo news: I don't know if it's the official logo, but the
    new CBS series \"Shark\" uses a light Futura with a slightly tall \"A\". To me
    it's borderline Toosubtlitis; a Benguiatish asymmetrical \"A\" would have been
    more memorable (if less impressive to fellow members of the graphic design establablishment).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
