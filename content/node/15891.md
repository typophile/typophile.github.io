    target="_blank">Rockwell Condensed</a>?  Actually it looks like something between
    the regular form and the condensed one.  Maybe some stretching involved?

  body: I don't think it's a font. Those things were around back in the metal type
    days and I don't think the little buggers would stand up to letterpress printing.
    I think the best you can do is find something similar, like Aachen Medium.

  body: "<em>Monotype fed me some false information. ;-)</em>\r\n\r\nThat page is
    pretty funny. Several of those are <strong>not</strong> what they say they are:\r\n\r\n-
    The TIME logo is custom drawn. Definitely not Times New Roman, despite the name.\r\n\r\n-
    Before they switched to a custom version of Myriad for their branding, Apple had
    a custom version of ITC Garamond called Apple Garamond. It was more condensed
    than ITC Garamond, but less condensed than ITC Garamond Condensed.\r\n\r\n- The
    National Geographic logo is custom, though it's based on Times New Roman.\r\n\r\n-
    Mobil has their own custom font, sort of a cross between Helvetica and Avant Garde
    Gothic."

    right. Forgot about that. It's ironic that it was produced for Apple by Bitstream
    which is no longer authorized to distribute it.\r\n\r\n<em>Always read the not
    so small print.</em>\r\n\r\nGood point. When I first saw that page a year or so
    ago, I do recall seeing that, now that you mention it."
