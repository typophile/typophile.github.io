It's a fat sans with some definite Eurostile influences.

I think it's safe to assume that the B, G, and g need the most work (and you will most likely find more).

Please excuse my lame sample page.


thanks!

Weights of straight strokes in your capitals need attention. The verticals of D and P (and maybe also B and R) are too thin. X, Y, Z are light, lighter, and lightest. Crossbar of H is heavy (match L).

The lowercase is in good shape, even the g, I think. It might be nice for the crossbar of the f to be a little heavier, but not necessarily. I like the short ascender of k.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not a pro so you might want to forget about this, but the top horizontal stroke of the a (is there a name for that) seems to be a bit to long to me. It's like an overshoot. Because the bowl of the a more round (less squared) than the rest it needs more overshoot.

		<div class="commentbody">Your capital G needs more whitespace, so I suggest you make it wider. All together it looks good, but I think you should make more weights. I'm having the same problem with expleus right now, because makng more weights for the same design is just really boring. I like your lowercase g by the way. Hope you wanna have a look at expletus.</div>

Thanks for the comments, Jasper. I shortened the "a" a bit. I totally reworked the G. I also did some more work on the 5. It still doesn't look right, though. I wasn't sure what your suggestion ("For the 5 I'd try to make the line of the inside of the bowl continue in the vertical stroke next to it.") was getting at.

I'll definitely be working on other weights, but not until this one is closer to completion.

thanks!

		<div class="commentbody">Jasper,

Good idea about the 5. That was actually the kind of the way I originally had it, before the font went in a more Eurostile direction. I then moved away (somewhat) from the Eurostile direction, but the 5 was still showing it. It's gone now. I think the 5 still needs more work, but it's getting there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Blocko is now Corsair. Check out the new PDF in the original post. I've done a lot of work on a many of the previously seen characters, and I've also added a bunch more, as well as punctuation. I haven't done a ton of work with spacing at this point, and no kerning. I'm mainly concerned about shapes, widths, and weights at this point.

And input is greatly appreciated.


thanks!</div>
