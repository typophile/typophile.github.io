  body: someone else also said the same day that PUA were okay in decorative fonts
    to allow users of apps that aren't unicode savvy to access all alternates. PUA
    aren't appropriate for fonts that are meant to set text. At least that's how I
    understood it...

    PUA aren\u2019t appropriate for fonts that are meant to set text. At least that\u2019s
    how I understood it\u2026\"\r\n\r\nIt was me who said it :) PUA should be avoided
    when it's really important to preserve true character information in a continuous
    text. A font like Zapfino Extra that isn't used to typeset long texts but its
    purpose is rather to make \"text collages\", is fine to use PUA. After all, the
    designer will most likely use some ornaments, calligraphic extensions and other
    non-text elements in it. It really doesn't matter if the final result isn't totally
    searchable, because in a typeface like Zapfino, it's the GRAPHIC effect that counts.
    \r\n\r\nIn short: if form is more important, PUA is fine. If content is more important,
    avoid PUA. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
