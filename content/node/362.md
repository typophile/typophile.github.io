  to their ritual of catching trends a year or <BR>two late, Quay and Sack now mimic
  Takard&#39;s Bliss.  <BR>Funny to see a Tankard ad just 2 pages later. A pity  <BR>it&#39;s
  for the new Shaker weights or one could have in  <BR>their lap a handy printed comparison

    Monoline help revive interest in the super ellipse? Surely it&#39;s a good thing

    <BR>Anyway, that&#39;s news to me too. I knew about the geography difference,
    but thought they just had a long-distance thing going on. &#34;My cable modem
