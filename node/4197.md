body: 'Hello, <BR> <BR>Just wondering if any of you knew what this was. The movie
  was released in 1984 &#40;Temple of Doom&#41;. It&#39;s from the titles. Is there
  a suitable digital version around? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s related to the this
  post for the type on the poster. But I wanted to be thorough and check. Here&#39;s
  a link to that old post: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/13951.html"

  body: It looks like a cousin of Steile Futura, Tasse &#40;Font Bureau&#41; or Topic
    &#40;URW&#41;. A quick check at MyFonts didn&#39;t turn up that alternate N for
    any of those faces, though. <BR> <BR>Another, more recent face along the same
    lines is Emigre&#39;s Solex

  body: I think you were right about Tasse Marc, because it does have an alternate
    N like this, and an alternate rounded A. You can see the N and A <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10663172097593320&amp;fontname=Tasse"
    target="_blank">here</a> in the words &#34;COMMUNITY OUTRAGED&#34;. It is shown
    more clearly in the Font Bureau Type Specimens book. While Solex has an S like
    this, it has neither the N nor the A. <BR> <BR>Of course, this has been slanted
    graphically, since Tasse has no oblique face.

  body: Both Tasse and Solex were created long after this movie was released. The
    inspiration for both of these was Steile Futura/Topic &#40;both are names of the
    same Bauer foundry face&#41; which had these alternate characters in the roman
    styles. It appears that the alternate characters were not included in the existing
    dital versions.  <BR> <BR>Interesting that they used a face released in the mid-fifties
    for a film set 20 years earlier.

  body: Kinda sorta. Glad it was useful. <BR> <BR>Mark, I&#39;d always thought that
    Futura Display was just another name for Steile Futura/Topic, <BR>but <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ftbauer/futura-display/familytree.html"
    target="_blank"> these fonts</a> by that name are quite different. An entirely
    different typeface?

  body: Same designer, different typeface. It&#39;s funny, I&#39;d never noticed the
    similarities between Futura Display and Steile Futura/Topic before. I think this
    was because I only knew it as Bauer Topic for a long time and didn&#39;t know
    Renner did it. Incidentally, Futura Display was released in 1932.

    <BR>What I really was after was the relationship between them, given the <BR>clear
    similarities. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the info, Mark.
