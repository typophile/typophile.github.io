body: "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nI was curious if anyone had an opinion on computer displays...\r\n\r\nI
  am shopping for a new monitor, and would like something with superb color accuracy,
  as well as excellent, crisp, type rendering.\r\n\r\nSo far, I am really liking the
  NEC 27\" Spectraview (http://www.necdisplay.com/p/desktop-monitors/pa271w-bk-sv).\r\n\r\nI
  have also looked at the Apple Cinema Displays, but I do not like a glossy screen.\r\n\r\nAny
  opinions would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nJustin"
