    easier to sell the stuff to people &#40;especially all the insecure ones -the
    &#34;rest of us&#34; as Apple calls them- that are afraid of computers&#41;, nevermind
    that they&#39;ll suffer in the long term, once they graduate beyond retard mode.

    as I loathe MS, XP does work very well. From what I know the newer MacOSes &#40;unlike

    <BR> <BR>Hrant: you make XP sound downright intuitive! My experience with it is
    anything but. And branding Mac users &#34;retards&#34; will not win friends and
    influence people. If you want to use all your digits, simply hold down the control
    key when you click with a one button mouse. It performs the same function as right
    click. You are clearly ignorant of the platform but are more than willing to trash
    it. <BR> <BR>I am not a mac elitist and would rather not debate the whole issue
    because frankly, it&#39;s dull. But I will state again: It is a matter of preference.

  body: Hmm. So what do Windows users use their left hand for? ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Seriously,
    I&#39;ve got a three-button mouse &#40;with scroll wheel&#41; on my Mac. The scroll
    wheel is the thing I most appreciate. I can never remember what the middle button
    is programmed to do, and it takes relatively difficult contortions to press it
    anyway &#40;probably a connection there&#41;. The right button is nice, but control-click
    is just as easy. Sometimes I accidentally hit the left button while holding down
    the right button, a mistake that can&#39;t happen with a one-button mouse. In
    general, I find the multi-button mouse a bit less comfortable to use since you
    have to hold it with the thumb and two fingers instead of the thumb and three
    fingers, and the remaining two fingers must be more precisely placed. But I&#39;m
    totally hooked on that scroll wheel. <BR> <BR>The idea that a one-button mouse
    is for those with half a brain is ridiculous. If anything, it would engage both
    right and left sides of the brain more fully, since you need both hands for certain
    mouse operations. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s necessarilly better, but it&#39;s
    not necessarilly worse, either. Just different approaches with advantages and
    disadvantages on both sides.

    Mac to PC when Apple was still Steve-Job-less and never looked back, but the new
    OSX-Look would have driven me away for sure. And even on XP, you can&#39;t really
    like the look unless you switch off a lot of effects, hack the bootscreen, change
    the icons, the colours and basically make th system look the way you want it.
    On Win2000 I used WinBlinds to customize the look, on XP I just hacked it a bit
    and that is quite enough. The simpler the better. I argue that an Operating System
    for professionals &#40;not the Home-versions, mind&#41; should be as lean and
    efficient and most of all customizable as possible. XP and OSX are overloaded.  <BR>

    one was the worst, but the current lozenge-shaped one isn&#39;t too good either.
    My favorite was the pre-iMac tear-drop-shaped mouse. It was comfortable and responsive.
    The recent ones are nice to look at, but there is definitely too much geometry
    and not enough ergonometry.

    of. As I said, I&#39;m using a multi-button mouse with a scroll wheel. The scroll
    wheel is the thing I miss when I use a regular Mac mouse, not the extra buttons.
    I wouldn&#39;t mind a one-button mouse with a scroll wheel. Even better would
    be if I could also use it to scroll horizontally. It&#39;s really annoying when
    I get to one of those oddball sites that scrolls horizontally and I have to scroll
    using the scroll bar. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Interestingly, Apple recently got a patent
    for a mouse with a dial on it that can scroll both directions. <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/columns/devilsadvocate/2003/20030425.shtml"

    <BR> <BR>My complaints with Apple&#39;s current lozenge-shaped mouse are that
    the click is too stiff &#40;even at the lowest setting&#41;, the top end of the
    mouse where you click is too large &#40;at least for me--I have smaller than average
    hands&#41;, and it&#39;s trickier to pickup and move the mouse in the middle of
    a drag operation since nearly the whole mouse is a button. Plus, it doesn&#39;t
    have a scroll wheel. :-&#41;

    find the scroll wheel works best for smaller, less continuous amounts. For going
    through pages and pages of stuff, it gets rather inefficient.  <BR> <BR>One thing
    you may have noticed on that MacObserver page is that not all Mac users are happy
    with the one-button mouse. But, as you yourself have often pointed out, people
    don&#39;t always know what&#39;s best for them. ;-&#41;
