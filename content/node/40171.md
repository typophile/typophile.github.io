body: This is about packaged files that I received from my art director. When he packaged
  the font DIN and I open it, the info says that it is 0 kb and there is no file extension.
  I can't load it in Fontbook or Suitcase. Any suggestions? Thank. Oh and if this
  is posted somewhere else please let me know. I am new on this board and haven't
  really browsed around too much.

  body: If they are Mac suitcase files, then, most likely, the resource fork (part
    of the file) was lost. In Mac font suitcases, this is where all the data is stored,
    which is why the files are 0 kb. This can happen if the files were transfered
    to some non-Mac file system. Non-Mac file systems cannot "see" the resource fork
    and it doesn't get copied.

  body: 'One other thing: If the font suitcases were emailed, you can lose the resource
    fork that way, too. The best solution, if the fonts are to be transfered over
    the internet, is to compress the files using StuffIt or use OS X Finder''s "archive"
    feature to create a .zip file containing the fonts. When the fonts are uncompressed
    on the receiving end, the resource forks will be intact. (This is all assuming
    the computer on the receiving end is also a Mac.)'

  body: I've had problems with .zip files losing their resource fork. I've since only
    used .sit and had no problems.

  body: My advice is the same as Mark's and Tiffany's... Have them use StuffIt on
    the font files before e-mailing or switching to a non-Mac platform.

  body: 'I think the .zip option only works if you do it from the Finder compress/uncompress
    command on both ends. If you make the .zip file using some other utility, it probably
    won''t work. '
