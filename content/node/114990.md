  body: The font is Chorus Girl and the only source I'm aware of is on the CD bundled
    with the <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Victorian-Display-Fonts-CD-ROM-Electronic/dp/0486999564/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394897721&sr=8-1&keywords=24+fonts+victorian'
    target='_blank'>24 Victorian Display Fonts CD-ROM and Book </a>.  Dover stopped
    making and selling these several years ago, so I've linked to one possible solution
    (just make sure the CD is intact).

  body: "I stand corrected. This is an inept Victorian design, rather than a modern
    mish mash. Looking at the full alphabet, I see no reason to modify my critical
    appraisal. It's still a somewhat standard Latin with discordant coat hooks pasted
    on -- presumably so the chorus girls have someplace to hang their costumes after
    the show.\r\nDon "

  body: "I agree, Don. Spot-on appraisal.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Matt. The font was a
    bit manually stretched (so as to allow for easier hanging of costumes)."

  body: "Might help if you gave some hint as to the nature of the image, logo, menu,
    old book etc and an approximate date.\r\nAt first glance this looks like a \"Latin\"
    type such as Etienne http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/etienne/ Latin CT http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/latin-ct/
    ITC Barcelona http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/barcelona/ or Spike http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/quadrat/spike/
    with a shadow line and coat-hook ornaments pasted amidships. \r\nThis is not to
    say that someone has not packaged this mish mash as a font. Could have been done
    by a Victorian typemaker with little imagination or a similarly changed modern
    designer.\r\nCompare it with the somewhat similar, but much better designed Algerian

  body: "Please don't get me wrong, I AM a fan of Victorian ornate typefaces when
    they are imaginative and well executed. But this one is so uninspired and clunky
    that it gives a bad name to the whole genre.  \r\nDon"
