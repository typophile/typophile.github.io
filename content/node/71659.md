  downloaded about 100 fonts from DaFont - the majority were poor; some were good;
  some were excellent. But according to some designers, free fonts never cut it. \r\n\r\nWhat's
  your opinion on this? Is it nearly impossible to find good typefaces which are on
  par with commercial fonts, or not?\r\n\r\nIf anyone could put up links to good free
  font resources, I'd be grateful.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm waiting for your responses."

    Libre Fonts]].  Maybe not quite what you're looking for, but a start.  And this:
    [[http://typophile.com/node/14652|FAQ Free Fonts]].  Perhaps the first list has
    too few and the second list has too many?  You can also check out [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/index.html|exljbris
    Font Foundry]], which contains free and non-free typefaces often praised on typophile.
    \ I'll turn it over to someone more knowledgeable than me now.\r\n\r\nst"

  body: "I don't think you can generally say freefonts are good or bad. There are
    some excellent fonts out there that are free, some good display faces. And there
    is a lot of crap. What is often said is that you get what you paid for it. I don't
    neccesarily agree with this. I think sometimes freefonts can be useful, for instance
    for single use headlines in magazines, or for banners. And designers like Jos
    Buivenga give away some weights of their fonts for free, and they are brilliant.
    \r\n\r\nAs for freefont resources: this is hard as most offer illegal fonts as
    well, and no proper information on licencing. Fontsquirrel.com is quite good in
    this respect. And fontspece.com is OK as well. But always double check, and avoid
    websites like fontyukle and 1001fonts, as they offer lots of illegal and probably
    corrupted fonts."

  body: "For basic display use: If we start by removing the free fonts that are rip-offs,
    the ones with messy outlines, no (or bad) kerning, uneven spacing, uneven weight,
    none of the necessary ligatures, no overshots, no optical corrections and the
    ones that doesn\u2019t support basic Western European you still have a few left.\r\n\r\nFor
    more complex use: If you also remove the ones with no more then one weight, you\u2019ve
    narrowed it down to a handful.\r\n\r\nFor screen use: Remove those who does not
    preform well on screen \u2026\r\n\r\nNext: Remove the plain ugly ones.\r\n\r\nAnd
    there\u2019s also how well they actually preform. No amateur could afford the
    testing that went into a professional problem solving typeface like Terminal Design\u2019s
    [[http://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/|Clearview]]. "

  body: "Like Linux, free fonts are usually only free if your time is worth nothing.
    For example, if you like the fonts on The League of Movable Type\u2019s sites,
    you first have to start downloading them and figure out which ones are actually
    finished. Because most of them aren\u2019t. If you want to use the stuff you find
    on DaFont, you have to sift through the ninety-plus percent that are just student
    projects based on movie, comic book, or album logos. Then you have to narrow it
    down again, sifting for the ones that were actually drawn, spaced, and kerned
    correctly as opposed to just being spaced and kerned with no human intervention.
    Etc., etc., etc.. I would recommend just downloading the exLibris free fonts and
    not even bothering with the rest."

    problem with that analogy is that Ubuntu installs a lot quicker than Windows 7.\r\n\r\nBut,
    yea, one should consider the total cost. If you're spending time sifting through
    DaFont's offerings, that could easily cost more in time that a quality commercial
    face does in dollars. "

    [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/|Font Squirrel]].\r\n\r\nAs for my own opinion as
    not a pro but a serious, interested onlooker, I believe <em>everything</em> has
    its place in the realm of graphic design; the hard part is making educated choices
    (because choices are always hard and education doesn't just fall on our lap) and
    making everything work. You could make a career and a name for yourself, if you
    so chose, just using free fonts. Hey, I believe someone already did, grunge style.\r\n\r\nI
    think there's a lot more room for error than hardcore typophiles (myself included,
    note) might acknowledge. If you have a vision of what you're trying to create,
    then everything should come relatively easily and all the rules of classic typesetting
    need not (well <em>not necessarily</em>) apply."
