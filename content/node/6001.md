  body: 'an English Translation.. <BR> <BR>Often you have wondered why a type that
    has the resistance of a text typography and its sober structure does not work
    well? <BR>A variable exists that is not seen, but that it is very, but very important:  the
    counterform.  <BR> <BR>The &#34;fish effect&#34; happens when the counterform
    commits of the round types is excessively greater compared to external &#40;space
    between characters&#41;.  This happens in the types that respond to geometric
    proportions of the type rather that to the optical proportions. <BR> <BR>The &#34;fish
    effect&#34; is a disagreeable effect that causes that the words are longer &#40;space&#41;
    that what the brain would have to catch, translating this in sensations of early
    satiety of reading and precocious boredom.  Perhaps, when we see the typography
    in great we did not notice the great differences between the counterforms, but
    when we began to drain these, the perceptual difference begins to grow radically,
    and the points more and more begin to be heavy that the lines. <BR> <BR>In typeworkshops
    of underware they are explained some passages like avoiding the fish effect, occupying
    technical of optimization of the proportion.  <BR> <BR>They have felt that passes
    something similar when they read futura?  Any doubt or commentary, the debate
    begins:'

  body: Almost seems like an issue exclusive to kerning; I mean, when you design a
    round object as round as some of those it seems like you&#39;d just have to accept
    some aberrations.  Again, seems like kerning is the culprit--can&#39;t the problem
    be fixed by pulling parallels farther from each other than the mathematical distance
    between curves?

  body: 'I think anybody would agree that the White &#40;better than &#34;counterform&#34;,
    for a number of reasons&#41; is important. Balancing the weights of the white
    and black in a bouma is critical to reading - but there&#39;s also something else:
    the whites can be too modular. In fact, when they follow the black perfectly,
    <i>and</i> the black is too modular, then you get a huge loss of differentiation,
    and readability falls through the floor &#40;since information comes from contrast&#41;.
    Set the word &#34;tobacco&#34; in Avant Garde and see what I mean. <BR> <BR>But
    this is not limited to highly constructed fonts, like AG or Futura. In more covert
    way, chirographic fonts suffer from the same problem: because the two edges of
    the black are made harmonious, the white effectively follows the black. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    why Legato is such a hugely important development: it breaks the anti-readability
    codependence. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Part of the problem is when you have fonts with nearly circular &#34;o&#34;
    glyphs like your example.  The circle is very hard to escape; it has a bullseye
    effect.  This stops the reading rythym abruptly.  When you put it next to a bunch
    of tightly spaced verticals, you get a dark spot, particularly if there are lots
    of acenders &#40;like &#34;illi&#34;.  Even if you letterspace a lot, the &#34;o&#34;s
    still grab your attention.

  body: Legato is a wonderfully balanced mixture of influences, and manages to get
    the best reading results from those I suppose. I see pieces of the previous Balance,
    and extremes from both sans-serifs and epigraphy, all melded uniquely. I never
    liked Avance, but a serif study on Legato would rock &#40;and I suppose Bloemsma
    will do it&#41;. <BR> <BR>But I still don&#39;t understand what you mean by &#34;chirographic&#34;.
    Can you make actual examples?

  body: 'Claudio, although no design exists in a vacuum, I think you&#39;re seeing
    things maybe you <i>want</i> to see. Legato is based on a pretty progressive theory
    more than anything else - it&#39;s a constructed font&#42; that aims to create
    bonding between glyphs, essentially by breaking the dominance of the Black. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; This is in fact it&#39;s only -but important- weakness. Bloemsma needs
    to break free of Modernism to get to the pinnacle. In this respect Bilak is on
    a better track. <BR> <BR>Chirography: I don&#39;t know about giving examples &#40;since
    almost all fonts have both chirography and typography in them&#41;, but I guess
    the best way to define it is that it exhibits the effects of wrtiting by hand,
    especially using a broad-nib pen. Jan Middendorp apparently sees chirography in
    Legato, but as far as I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s an illusion: using stroke contrast
    as a feature is one thing, deriving it from the way a broad nib pen makes marks
    is another. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: '&#62;But I still don&#39;t understand what you mean by &#34;chirographic&#34;&#60;
    <BR> <BR>Chirographic is like Caligraphic &#40;more flat pen than pointed pen
    though&#41;.  Broad nibbed pens were held at a constant angle &#40;usually 30
    or 45 degrees depending on the style&#41;. When a stroke was made--the &#34;O&#34;
    is the best example--the narrowest part of the stroke was off center of the vertical
    &#40;to the left on the top and to the right on the bottom&#41; causing a slight
    appearance of axis rotation &#40;see Palatino&#41;.  Garamond has the off vertical
    axis but it looks more &#34;Typographic&#34; than Palatino, which looks more &#34;Chirographic&#34;.
    Zapf had a very strong calligraphy background.  When he lectured to my sophomore
    year typography class, he would write quite beautiful Roman letters on a blackboard
    using the side of a piece of chalk held at an angle like a flat-pen. <BR>What
    used to be called &#34;Modern&#34; type faces, like Bodoni, had the axis of the
    thinest part of the stroke at the vertical.  Today the term &#34;Modern&#34; can
    be confusing.  The term &#34;Modernism&#34; refered to by Hrant is certainly different.  Ask
    him, but I think he is refering to the 1950-60s era and to fonts like Helvetica.
    <BR> <BR>Another difference is in proportions. The classic Roman proportions were
    prominant in older letterforms where the &#34;Modern&#34; proportions try to give
    the illusion of most letters &#40;not M, W, l, or i&#41; being visually equal
    in width.  The terms &#34;appear&#34; and &#34;visually equal&#34; are quite important
    since almost no glyphs from even &#34;Modern&#34; fonts are actually equal in
    width. <BR> <BR>ChrisL'

  body: 'I&#39;m not the doyen of the term or anything &#40;for one thing, I got it
    directly from John Hudson&#41;, but to me &#34;chirographic&#34; isn&#39;t necessarily
    related to the broad nib pen - it can be based on the ballpoint pen just as well
    - the important thing is the organic/physical_tool participation. And the reasons
    to differentiate it from &#34;calligraphy&#34; are that: the idea of &#34;beauty&#34;
    is not a requirement; and the term &#34;calligraphy&#34; has too much baggage,
    like the stuff people see on dipomas, etc. As an example, many of Zapf&#39;s fonts
    are calligraphic, while Gerrit Noordzij&#39;s are not, but they&#39;re still strongly
    chirographic. That&#39;s why GN bags on Zapf for producing artsy stuff only fit
    for hanging on a wall, while I think they&#39;re both just playing at different
    ends of the same sandbox. And Licko and Crouwel are playing on the other end of
    the same playground &#40;Modernism&#41;. The real world is outside. <BR> <BR>As
    for &#34;Modernism&#34;, I have a pretty unorthodox meaning for it. For one thing,
    I see the Ancient Romans as having planted the seed, and the Enlightenment as
    having made it acceptable, and the 20th century is merely when it entered the
    mainstream in a formal manner. I don&#39;t feel too guilty using a somewhat &#34;custom&#34;
    meaning since -as you imply- the term is heavily overloaded anyway. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Thanks for the clarification.  The &#34;beauty&#34; or lack of it then is
    the telling distinction.  Of course many can argue what beauty is &#40;other than
    anything to do with truth and roses :-&#41;
