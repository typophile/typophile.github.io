  <BR> <BR>This design will hopefully be engraved on a ring one day soon.  There is
  also a good chance it&#39;ll be used for &#40;print&#41; invitations. <BR> <BR>I
  am concerned about the legibility on the right half.  It&#39;s difficult for me
  to be objective after staring at the design for so long... <BR>   <BR>Any feedback
  would be greatly appreciated!

  body: great idea Hilary ... <BR> <BR>i read Hillary &#43; Akele <BR> <BR>the Hillary
    part seems a bit scrunched when compared <BR>to the Akele. You could extend the
    LA cluster so the <BR>counters are more open. <BR> <BR>You might get something
    more wedding-ish if you went <BR>more scripty ... but it&#39;d be more of a fit
    challenge to engrave  <BR>on a ring.

  body: Thanks for the feedback guys! <BR> <BR>Andriy - I&#39;m now concerned about
    the legibility on both halves ;&#41; The names are supposed to read &#34;Hilary
    &#43; Kaye&#34;. <BR> <BR>bj - Thanks for your input!  The entire word reads a
    lot better now!  I modified the &#34;e&#34; as well, but that area is tricky.

    <BR> <BR>Something &#34;scripty&#34; would definitely be more appropriate than
    this heavy metal look.  I&#39;ll try sketching something new...

  body: I didn&#39;t have any problem reading the hilAry, but the Kaye is difficult
    to see. Like BJ, I read an &#34;a&#34; at the beginning. You&#39;ve got your work
    cut out for you in hiding that first &#34;e&#34;. The Kaye is was easy for me
    to read once I lost that &#34;e&#34;.

  body: I say hilary right awawy, but not kaye. <BR> <BR>Have you considered making
    the entire phrase an ambigram &#40;as opposed to each individual name&#41;? No
    idea if that would make it easier or harder...

  body: I agree with darrel&#39;s advice. <BR> <BR>Using the first two letters gives
    you the flexibility to make the wedding mark more symbolic, personal without it
    needing to be completely understood by those, well, outside of the union. <BR>
    <BR>Would give you the freedom to crunch the letters up more into a sigil. A more
    alchemical representation and yet, modern.

  body: To better hide the &#34;e,&#34; make it a capital &#34;E.&#34; I think that
    will improve legibility on both ends. <BR> <BR>The &#34;a&#34; in the middle of
    &#34;Kaye&#34; could just as easily be an &#34;e.&#34; I find that usually, the
    most reliable approach to a reversible two-tiered &#34;a&#34; is a sort of backwards
    &#34;s&#34; with serifs. <BR> <BR>&#34;Hilary&#34; reads just fine, but it might
    read even better if you shorten the crossbar so that it doesn&#39;t quite touch
    the &#34;L.&#34; The &#34;A&#34; will survive this.

  body: I think it would help a lot if you make the E Caps. You could add the same
    flourish to the bottom of the K as you have on the top. Then conitinue the crossbar
    of the K to make the middle arm of the E (When its flipped over.) Make sense?
    Might work out. Looks great though.

  body: "What program do you use to draw your ambigrams? I'm interested in them as
    well, but haven't yet found a good program.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I believe if
    you made  your script more curly and elegant, the \"e\" attached to the \"y\"
    could be touching...and would fit in with the curly style. Sort of like the Edwardian
    Script font or something like that."
