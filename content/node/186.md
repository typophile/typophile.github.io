    its timeless uniqueness and likeability <BR> <BR>2. Linotype Frutiger Condensed
    <BR>For its 100% clarity. Perfect for signage. <BR> <BR>3. Verdana <BR>I need
    a good font for my browser -- and we were allowed to bring our G4, remember? <BR>
    <BR>4. Linotype Univers Condensed <BR>I may be the sole inhabitant on the island,
    but sooner or later I will have the need to publish a catalogue or a list. Univers
    Condensed will come in handy. <BR> <BR>5. PMN Caecilia <BR>At the moment I can&#39;t
    stand the sight of it. But this typeface is &#42;so good&#42; that I simply must
    bring it. <BR> <BR>6. Lexicon <BR>I have never used this font. I have never owned
    it. By choosing it to this forum I hope that some yuletime-spirited guy at Ensched&eacute;
    will &#42;give&#42; it to me. In return I shall study it closely. <BR> <BR>7.
    Tate Gallery Corporate Typeface &#40;Wolff Olins&#41; <BR>God, it&#39;s beautiful!
    Recently I asked about it in Typophile Forum Type Identification Board. One of
    you guys said it resembled both VAG and DIN. <BR> <BR>8. Minion <BR>As good a
    text face as any when treated right. <BR> <BR>9. ITC Bodoni <BR>I guess I can&#39;t
    do without a good Bodoni. <BR> <BR>10. Parisine <BR>I greatly admire the work
    of JFP! "

    Akzidenz Grotesk, Baskerville, Bodoni, Caslon &#40;Adobe, Berthold, or Caslon

    <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; The reason for the &#39;deadline&#39; seemed obvious, but
    I guess not because we went from &#39;greatest&#39; faces to &#39;favorite&#39;
    faces. If you are posting a &#39;greatest&#39; list, then you want lists that
    are not influenced by others, thus everyone posts at a certain time. Favorites,
    it doesn&#39;t really matter. So by all means post, this year, next year, whenever.
    As you can see, the &#39;strict&#39; deadline was not a deadline at all. &#40;By
    the way, the first post was made on Dec. 6.&#41; Personally, I&#39;m learning
