  post at the one I've had for awhile.  Thanks to prodding from Yves, I'm up to one
  a week <a href="http://lasquetipress.blogspot.com">here</a>....

    one, which is pretty much every Tuesday -- that's not exactly what I'd call \"maintaining\"
    the one here.\r\n\r\nBut I do have the pix up for tomorrow's entry already up
    on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/lasquetipress\">Flickr</a>....  ;-)"
