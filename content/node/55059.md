body: "Hey guys, \r\nI was wondering how do typeface licensing work for schools? are
  there any specs for licensing typefaces for school projects?\r\nas students, do
  we have a license to use typefaces that we get through school in school projects
  only? are there any complications at all? am I breaking the rules if I use typefaces
  in school projects, therefore not making profit out of them?\r\n\r\nI hope this
  hasn't been discussed before, thanks\r\n\r\nPS. It's my first post"

  body: "Hey Javier\r\n\r\nThe school usually purchases (volume discount) site licenses
    for all of its software \u2013 fonts included \u2013 and any such license specifies
    the number of machines (onsite and/or offsite) that the software is for. By machines
    we mean computers, servers and printers. \r\n\r\nAs a student, you will be covered
    by the license agreement if you are working on school machines during school hours
    on school assignments. School projects are \u2013 by default \u2013 not-for-profit
    assignments, so no problem there (winning cash prizes on big design competitions
    might be the only exception to this).\r\n\r\nAs Guerrizmo says, where it gets
    messy is when students copy fonts illegally from the school library and take them
    home to do commercial assignments. Most instructors I know warn students against
    this."

  body: "Thanks Ben, \r\nstill a question tho, we get laptops through school that
    come with a default package of type families loaded on it. I am assuming those
    would still cover licensing, or not?\r\n\r\nAlso, i have participated in national
    competitions competitions with projects made in school. Should I turn them down
    or do something about it?\r\n\r\n "

    licensing the school has arranged.\r\n\r\nNever turn down a chance to compete;
    especially if you can crank out national competition standard stuff with default
    typefaces."
