Yep, I think the spacing "PAS" and "SAGE" could use some work (PA and SA combinations too tight), also to my eye the italic Q and S's looks distorted - is this the true italic?

I like well made tattoos. But I can hardly imagine, that one is not having regrets about a tattoo like yours later.

I agree with Nick. (I like the quote, too.) 

Just be aware that it <em>is</em> tempting fate/life to get large, light, geometric letters tattooed on a uh, morphable area of the body. It makes for a very nice texture; but make sure you're comfortable with the fact that even if you don't gain weight, it won't always look like it does in your nice mockups but will sag and wrinkle. Skin gets old and looser, and tattoos get lighter and blurrier. If you're fine with that, good.
That said, I would consider making the name bigger, and/or looser (in terms of spacing). In the layout it looks good in terms of proportion, but it might just be too small/dense/detailed for skin.
Also, please get a tattoo artist who really knows what they're doing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think a geometric typeface is a good choice on this part of the body. Keep in mind that your belly will change over the years, it's kind of unavoidable. And a distorted Futura will look horrible. Plus, it's really, very hard to make perfect rounds with such thin lines on skin, and there is always a possibility for the ink to spread a little... Consider choosing a typeface that will aesthetically handle this kind of problem. Also, the quote says that wise people are also a little crazy - imho, Futura is really not the best choice for the idea. At last, the line seem pointless and 80's, and the name of the author is, again imho, useless.

		<div class="commentbody">I've been pondering about getting a type tattoo for a while as well and I'd just like to point out that tattooing isn't a very exact art-form. The little details that make the letterform can easily disappear, no matter how experienced and/or talented the tattoo artist might be. Skin stretches and while the letters might look good with your arm in a certain position, it will probably look (very) warped when you move around. Also the above mentioned blurring of tattoos may cause problems, especially with such thin lines.

Type tattoos can be cool, but it's important to keep in mind that tattoo artists are not typographers and skin isn't a piece of paper. A tattoo can never be a perfect copy of your design and vector-sharp edges will blur with time. When I was designing my own tattoo, I had some unrealistic expectations on how the result should turn out. After talking to various tattoo artists, I came to accept the fact that I can't have complete control over the tattooing process. One of the studios I visited actually had a sign on the front door stating that they won't make tattoos for graphic designers – I don't know exactly why, but I think it has something to do with the fact that perfectionists and control-freaks are notoriously hard to work with ;)

Just my two cent's worth.</div>

Going smaller with everything will help things on this front. I'd also increase the pt. size of the name as it could easily turn to an unreadable blob at that size, weight and tracking.
