  be this large type? It's from <a href=\"http://triborodesign.com/index.php?article_id=1\">Triboro</a>
  who has been known to make their own fonts, but this isn't at all like their others.
  Definitely in the Kis/Janson realm, but not Hoefler Titling.\r\n\r\nThe other type
  is Chronicle."

    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/|Display]]) on these samples,
    I guess we could considerer it's the custom typeface they're talking about and,
    as you already suggested, very close to (or even based on) Chronicle..."
