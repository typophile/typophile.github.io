<div class=commentbody>The Eighties are back! <br> <br>I'll have to think about that one, Jonathan. As <br>far as I understand it, basically Postmodernism <br>was a reaction against the overly clean and <br>neutral Modernist style with it's all-Helvetica <br>(or similar 'neutral' sans serif) typography and <br>subdued 'less-is-more' composition and graphic <br>design. <br> <br>Postmodernism proclamed 'less-is-a-bore' and <br>reintroduced classicist elements with added <br>extravaganza: combining typefaces and distinctive <br>period-styles (Ahhh... Bodoni mixed with VERY <br>loosely tracked Futura all-caps <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> ). <br> <br>Typography-wise the most visible and well-known <br>examples might be the 'typefaces' <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=neville%2Bbrody" target=_blank> Neville Brody</a> <br>originally designed for The Face (and those of his <br>copycat <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=david%2Bquay" target=_blank> David Quay</a>) and stuff found in the first <br>issues of <a href=http://www.emigre.com/EMagView.php target=_blank> Emigre Magazine</a>. <br> <br>I hope I'm not making a fool of myself because <br>this is all at the top of my (bald) head, yaknow. <br>If you need other examples, I can do some research.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmmm :/ I didn't <i>really</i> answer your question, did I? <br>Here goes nothing: <br> <br>As far as type design is concerned, I think a <br>post-modern typeface is one that borrows traits <br>of typical period faces and reconfigures them in a <br>contemporary way, for example Neville Brody's <br><a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/industria/ target=_blank> Industria</a> or <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/arcadia/ target=_blank> Arcadia</a> which refer to the 30s and <br>Quay's <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/bordeaux-roman/ target=_blank> Bordeaux Roman</a> which is a narrow redesign <br>of a Bodoni-style modern face.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Post-modern type is ill defined, and usually an abused term. On the other hand, the valuable core of the movement does contain a lot of promise - but people are not letting it grow beyond childhood. <br> <br>The me that core is the truism that a system can never understand itself. It rejects the naive control-mania of Modernism, and moves to the East, for fuzzier -but much more human- communication. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>As for quotes: Brody's early designs were actually <br>political statements, directly inspired by the <br>disastrous Thatcherism of the Eighties, which he <br>considered being so detrimental to Great-Britain <br>that it reverted back into a state similar to the <br>depression-era Thirties, hence the 30s-style <br>geometrical lettering and the graphic deconstruction <br>of his lay-outs.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>>It's just that I immediately associate post-modernism with the eighties post-modernism which I grew up with <br> <br>One of the problems with post-modernism is that it means different things in different contexts (which could itself be a very post-modern thing) <br>In most cases it is a reaction against modernism, but modernism as a movement in the arts, for example, might be a well defined and relatively recent thing, whereas social and political historians talk of modernism as the whole shift towards rationalism following the enlightenment. <br>Someone might say, for example, that Marx's attempt to uncover patterns in historical development was a typically modernist activity, part of the modernist project to understand the world from a rationalist perspective and to set all knowledge into a grand scheme of life, the universe and everything. <br>A post-modernist might criticise this percieved approach, arguing that reality can't be shoe-horned into neat theoretical patterns. A post-modernist approach might be to argue that the world is (as hhp says) too fuzzy to fit into the modernist perspective. <br>One of the problems with post-modernism is its natural position hiding behind the coat-tails of the king's new clothes. I'm sure it would be possible to say worthwhile things from a post-modern perspective, but too often its a cover for lazy thinking, which is immune to criticism because any complaints are obviously from a rationalist, modernist angle, which is just incapable of understanding the post-modern view. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> too often its a cover for lazy thinking <br> <br>Exactly. Or even hooliganism. <br> <br>PoMo will mature only when it starts trying to understand the boundaries between the knowable and the unknowable. The problem with Modernism is that it's as mature as it can get (as a philosophy, although inherently never in application), but in terms of humanity it's only half the picture. Obviously, I'm a post-modernist! :-) Modernism is for kids. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Robert Bringhurst discusses postmodernism in "The Elements of Typographic Style". <br> <br>He classifies such faces as ITC Esprit (<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-esprit/ target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-esprit/</a>) and Nofret (<a href=http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90082.html target=_blank>http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90082.html</a>) as "Elegiac Postmodern", and he classifies such faces as Emigre's Triplex (<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/packages/144211/ target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/packages/144211/</a>) and ITC's Officina (<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=Officina" target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=Officina</a>) as "Geometric Postmodern". <br> <br>He also lists Photina (<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/photina/ target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/photina/</a>) and ITC Veljovic (<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-veljovic/ target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-veljovic/</a>) as examples of postmodernist faces. <br> <br>He also discusses such faces as Electra (<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/electra/ target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/electra/</a>), Fairfield (<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fairfield/ target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/fairfield/</a>) and Caledonia (<a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/caledonia/ target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/caledonia/</a>, <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/new-caledonia/ target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/new-caledonia/</a>) as being precursors to (and, in the case of the digitization of Fairfield specifically, a transition to) postmodern type design. <br> <br>As a sort of definition or list of qualifying characteristics, he offers this: <br> <br>"POSTMODERNIST (late 20th century): frequent parody of Neoclassical and Romantic form: rationalist axis; sharply modelled serifs and terminals; moderate aperture; italic subjugated to roman. (There are many kinds of Postmodernist letter....)" <br> <br>I might also suggest the books, "A History of Graphic Design", "Typology", "Typography Now", Typography Now Two", "Twentieth Century Type Designers" and "Twentieth Century Type", as possibly helpful resources. <br> <br>Good luck! <br> <br>David</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Emigre <br> <br>Emigre -the old Emigre- is in fact the bastion of that laziness/hooliganism: countering the "rules" just for the hell of it, as a juvenile reaction, at most hoping there's something on the other side, sans real insight, sans real commitment. That's why it didn't really catch on - it refused to grow up, through critical introspection and objective analysis. A new movement can start chaotically, but can only sustain itself through discipline. <br> <br>The good news is that there's a new Emigre now, and looking at some recent font releases, maybe, just maybe they're on the golden PoMo track now (although all I for one really see so far is faint signals). If that's the case, it sure would be nice for them to admit -and analyze- their confused past. What's scary of course is that intelligent PoMo wouldn't sell very well at the moment. Well, intelligent <i>anything</i>, really... <br> <br>> humanity is key <br> <br>One thing I would elaborate on that though is this: humanity isn't just formal humanism. The heart of any merit PoMo has (or could have) is the acceptance that humans are only half conscious. A serious, selfless perspective on communication is severely limited by restricting "humanity" to chirography, base animal emotions, or anything else: as much as possible needs to be considered, although necessarily imperfectly. And that's where Modernism implodes: it suffers from the classic Western chimera of Total Control. Give it up, people - it'll never work. <br> <br>> Bringhurst <br> <br>Like most any other scheme, I find his classification useful, but imperfect. Two places it fails: <br>1) It treats type design as an Art, and that's less than half the picture. <br>2) Being based on existing culture, it cannot really cover anything <i>new</i>. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>OK, I don't want to drag this back to politics again, but as postmodernism has been debated to death in that arena, some lessons from those debates might inform a discussion of postmodernism in typography, so here goes... <br> <br>>>I'm definitely a post-modernist <br> <br>When you say something like this in a philosophical context it can have 2 meanings: <br>1.'I believe in the principles I understand to be encompassed by the term post-modernism' <br>or <br>2.'I think we live in a post-modern age' <br> <br>You can hold both of these beliefs at the same time, or neither, or agree with either one while refuting the other. <br> <br>Would clarifying your position advance this discussion? <br>Has typography reached a post-modern stage? <br>If the world we live in is post-modern, what are the implications for typography and design in general? <br>(Perhaps the idea of a buch of plumped-up, self-serving graphic designers charging a fortune for their work is a thing of the modern era - you may scoff at bright yellow TNR on a royal blue background, accompanied by a selection of crappily cut-out clipart, or at arial and comic sans, but perhaps the democratisation of design and the stripping away of modern ideas of taste and composition are an inevitable feature of our post-modern future. <br>'Employ someone?

<div class=commentbody>1. I think Life is PoMo. <br>2. I try to harmonize by being PoMo myself. <br> <br>Typography -like anything else- results from what the duality of material comfort and peer acceptance dictates. At the moment, those two are almost identical in the West, which is of course what facilitates all this destructive egocentricism. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you David for your though post. <br> <br>I am interested in what are the ideologies of post-modern type design. And what triggered this style. Are then any particular schools of thought within post-modernism? <br> <br>If anyone finds any quotes justifying post modernism type design or attacking it I would be very greatfull. <br> <br>Also, it would be fantastic to have a quote from Jean F Porchez on your views on Modern and post-modern type design.

<div class=commentbody><i>I am interested in what are the ideologies of post-modern type design. And what triggered this style. Are then any particular schools of thought within post-modernism?</i> <br> <br>I would be more inclined to see Post-modernism as a way to <i>look</i> at type rather than to <i>design</i> it. To move away from rigid definitions and clasifications and towards something more open. <br> <br>M. <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Jonathan, the most public PoMo battles were certainly those in the pages of Emigre magazine. You will find quotes up the wazoo in there. In fact, if you buy their nice recent specimen (or get it free with a product purchase), you'll see it peppered with vintage bites. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
