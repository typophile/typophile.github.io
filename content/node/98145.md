  and Present State of Virginia, in Four Parts.\r\n\r\nNot the 1940-whatever edition
  put out by UNC press, the 1705 edition, with this imprint\r\n\r\nLondon: Printed
  for R. Parker, at the Unicorn, under the Piazza's of the Royal-Exchange.\r\n\r\nEven
  though what I've got to look at are distorted photocopies, I freely admit that identifying
  old foundry fonts lies outside, nay, far outside my skill set. & that at that time
  in England, the types could have come from anywhere. Well, they're not German. France,
  Italy, and Neiderland are still in the running. They are quite condensed for the
  time, and the varying slopes of the ascenders in the italic remind me of Jannons
  exuberance.\r\n\r\nPart of the point of identifying the font is to point out to
  the customer that no, we can't make it look like that edition, that the types used
  in England at that time weren't particularly \"English,\" (correct me if I'm wrong),
  and if they want allusive typography, they might want to pick a different theme
  to allude to. \r\n\r\nThanks for any help,"

    help if you can provide us with a sample.

    origin. Most of the British foundries didn\u2019t come into their own until the
    1800s."

    you'll need a real historian of type like James Mosley. You can reach him through
    the link at his blog: http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/.\r\n\r\nBut as far as allusive
    typography, Bruce Kennett did a book for the Folger Shakespeare Library's <em>Folio
    Mania!</em>, about Shakespeare's first folio. The first folio is early 1600s.
    He laid out the book in the two column style with italic & swash caps at the top,
    like Shakespeare's actual First Filio. And he used my Williams Caslon Text, with
    my swash letters at the top. This was mixed with photos of pages from the First
    Folio, as well as portraits from the time, etc. I'm prejudiced, but I think it
    worked out really well. You can see some samples [[http://pinterest.com/pin/180284791303277762/|here]]
    and [[http://pinterest.com/pin/180284791303320467/|here.]]\r\n\r\nI think it worked
    out partly because Caslon's point of departure were those types of the previous
    century, such as you probably have in your 1705 book.  \r\n\r\nThe reprint of
    a 1652 book, <em>Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum</em>, also used my Williams Caslon
    Text, again throwing around the swash caps and mixing in the original illustrations.
    Somehow it works, as you can see [[http://pinterest.com/pin/180284791303398671/|here.]]
    They used my font quite often at larger sizes than I intended, but it then looks
    like a result of old letter press ink spread. \r\n\r\n"

    century, but if the client insists on the idea of digital type resembling the
    1705 edition, then based on the title page images at [[http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/beverley/illustr.html]],
    I'd guess the Fell Types (1680s-90s) might be a reasonable approximation. And
    as for your point about not being English, Marini's site indicates that the fonts
    Fell bought were mostly Dutch, with some French italics in the larger sizes: [[http://iginomarini.com/fell/the-revival-fonts/]]\r\n\r\nI
    haven't tried working with them myself, so can't comment on how much reworking
    they might require."

    the text-size \"Fell Roman.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Granjon worked in Antwerp a while.
    And of course, though working in Neiderland, Kis was Hungarian & probably familiar
    with the work of the Venetians. Those old punchcutters moved around.\r\n\r\nWhat's
    always a danger with one of these project is that the half-informed will charge
    you made a bad decision"
