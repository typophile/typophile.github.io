body: I'm trying to limit the height of table cells in Indesign CS2 (Mac). At 8/10
  Indesign automatically gives all rows a height of 1p2, which is far more space than
  I need. If I try to use any less space, the text disappears and I just see a red
  dot in place of it. Am I doing something wrong, or is this just Indesign forcing
  me to use what Adobe's developers thought was a good minimum height for rows?

  body: You can mess around with both the leading and the height of the rows to get
    things in, but yes, you're right in InD wanting to ensure there's some padding.
