  <a href=\"http://www.ilab.org/db/detail.php?custnr=&booknr=305521334&source=&lang=en&ref=/services/catalogues.php\">here</a>
  and shown below?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/liber_librorum_4868.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  interested in the typography of Genesis 1:1\u20132:4a, and would love it if someone
  would supply me with scans of the 42 offerings in the <em>Liber Librorum</em> package.
  Other exemplars are welcome as well.\r\n\r\nYears ago I did a set of typographical
  exercises with the passage as base, using Futura and layering, Stefan Themerson's
  principle of Internal Vertical Justification, variations of font size, weight and
  colour to reflect levels of discourse and patterns of repetition / disruptions of
  strict repetition. Here's an excerpt:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vast_array_5102.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  dream of making a presentation out of this sometime, and direct access to the <em>Liber
  Librorum</em> items would help me out.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    I'll take you to the Clark - that library is an amazing treat.\r\n\r\n* No flash

    at actual size; time is not an issue.

  body: "I can do the opening pages of all, plus one full one if you like (please
    tell me which one). BTW, it looks like the book is 33cm tall, so ~13 inches, so
    with my 3264 x 2448 camera it comes out to 250dpi - is that OK, or would you prefer
    landscape shots of the top -or- bottom of each opening page at a little over 300dpi?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 250 dpi is fine; do portrait shots; do a full one if the turns are more than
    re-iterations of the approach of the opener (I don't know them). Many thanks!
