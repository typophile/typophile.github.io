body: "two questions:\r\n\r\n* first, what is the typographic term for the junction
  of the axis between the two u's (v shapes, normally) of the letter w?\r\n\r\n(see
  uploaded image)\r\n\r\n* is there an easy to find a font (preferably sans-serif)
  for everyday use where the junction of the axis occurs lower than the two stems
  on ether side? I guess the same might be true for a letter M as well. I've gone
  through my font explorer and library and can only find a few examples, like lithos
  but that's not really what I want.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nskipper

  body: "I wasn't aware of a special name, although \"apex\" seems good, a term which
    is used for the <em>A.</em>\r\n\r\nIt might seem strange to call it the apex when
    it's lower than the flanking stems, but it's more concise than \"centre joint\",
    and does suggest the shape."

    simply calls it the \u2018centre vertex\u2019."

  body: I have heard the term crotch, but that might only apply to the bottom part
    of the shape.
