body: I fear I don&#39;t know how to pronounce the names of some fonts. <BR> <BR>Kabel
  in particular at the moment. <BR> <BR>Does anyone have a link or suggestions? I
  assume there are accepted variances based on where you are. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance.

  body: I&#39;d have to guess KAH-bl, based on the German origins. But I&#39;m sure
    that it would answer to KAY-bl as well.

  body: With a couple of exceptions, these are limited to the English upper classes.
    <BR>The only ones of those your likely to find in common use are Marylebone &#40;often
    pronounced marley-bone&#41; and Worcestershire &#40;Woostershear&#41;. <BR>If
    you&#39;re in Oxford you&#39;ll hear Magdelene pronounced as Maudlin, and several
    other Oxford colleges appear to be confused as to how to spell their names. <BR>I
    suspect its a device to enable poor people, and other outsiders, to feel stupid.

    French origins by dropping the &#34;s&#34; sound, wouldn&#39;t you also want to
