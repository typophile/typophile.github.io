  for some especially interesting ampersands. Think beyond mega-swashy scripts (although
  if you know of some interesting ones that aren't Edwardian, Bickham, Nuptial, etc.,
  those are welcome too.) What are your personal faves? Thanks! -ecs"

  body: "I think ampersands are a bit similar to those distructive fonts that everyone
    creates at college, tear up some paper, scan it in, take it into fontographer
    and bingo, a typeface. \r\n\r\nI find it annoying when I see these fonts for sale,
    these are the fonts that one should create themselves. \r\n\r\nI think that an
    ampersand could be created similar to this, they can be taken out of a font and
    used on their own along with other faces. THis way you can create your own ampersand
    the way you want it without the worry of it fitting in.\r\n\r\nAlso it becomes
    a lot more personal which chould reflect the wedding theme a whole lot better.\r\n\r\n"

    I'm in a pre-pre-sketching phase of this. \r\n\r\nMatt, I think calling a whole
    piece of punctuation \"college trite\", to paraphrase, is a bit broad. I likely
    will be creating new type for this project, but I have to start somewhere. Whether
    or not I even use an ampersand is TBD, but interlocking letters that spell \"and\"
    in French is symbolic, even if it does tend to be more of a 'surface' concept
    than complex. "

    part of the English language. \r\n\r\nAnd it's lovely when you start a sentence
    with it (probably just the rebel in me).\r\n\r\nAnd I really hate abbreviations
    in all their forms.\r\n\r\nBut you must set it nicely. So be nice to it and it'll
    be nice to you."

    how you hate the way people use & instead of and in sentences but that is just
    people not understanding how to write. I hate things like if you are writing 2
    things you would write two things. But the ampersand is just the last of a few
    Latin truncations or abbreviations.\r\n\r\nI am kind of fond of '\xA3' truncation
    of the old Roman libra...\r\n"

    regarding this particular character should remain <em>your personal preferences</em>,
    and not a universal rule (take the iPods out of your ears and get a grip, people).
    The basic structure of the ampersand is supposed to reflect the Latin word <em>et</em>
    -- and -- not unlike the Latin term <em>per se</em> (Vince: <strong>not</strong>
    "per <strong>say</strong>") is understood as "in and of itself."'
