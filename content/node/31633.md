body: Can someone please tell me what font is used for the words "outwit, outplay,
  outlast" on the "Survivor" TV show logo? I know that the font "Survivant" is used
  for the word "SURVIVOR" on the logo, but the font used for the words "outwit,outplay,outlast"
  is slightly different. Please help me! Thanks.

    much less.
