    ' burns ' the card and puts next to the table , which is called the Turn. This
    card initiates the 3 round of betting. As in the earlier rounds , the first player
    to the left of the dealer starts by selecting the belt , check or assumes a given
    amount of chips. This happens until all players take decisions and it ends with
    a 3 round .\r\nhttp://www.poker-no-deposit.eu\r\n"
