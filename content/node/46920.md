body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI came across this photo took in Paris during the occupation,
  in 1943. I am very interested in the banners, and I am wondering if anyone has some
  insights about the types used there, especially the \"organisation\" on the right...
  I just can't put a name on this one, I actually don't even know if this is a typeface.
  Looks a bit like Eagle or Neutra, but some stuff won't fit (like the G)... any help?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: This is most likely [[lettering]], not typography. It is sign painting by
    hand and not based on any single typeface. That said, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/house_industries/neutraface_no_2_collection/">Neutraface</a>,
    which is quite similar as you observed, does indeed have this sort of G. See the

  body: "Thanks Stephen,\r\n\r\nI was quite sure that was lettering, but I thought
    this was still influenced by a typeface. Thanks for the heads-up on Neutraface,
    it really is close - but I'm still looking for this large S. Anyone knows about
    the other typeface?\r\n\r\ndr"

    is entirely likely that, on the contrary, there were typefaces from the period
    influenced by the popular sign-painter styles. I believe that is the more common
    directionality for influence before the latter quarter of the 20th century.\r\n"

    the US (Bankers Gothic), or lettering.\r\nIn this example, the greater curvature
    of the horizontal strokes (in S and C) is unusual, and very nice.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well yes, it is actually a good idea for a typeface, as long as we are 100%
    sure it is not already available somewhere - but so far, nothing. I unfortunately
    don't have this at a higher resolution.\r\n\r\nI already have quite a nice amount
    of high res and lower res pictures of bits or full alphabets which have never
    been adapted digitally, I think I will make a website out of them - or a book.
    let me know if this idea is interesting and if you have some documents to share
    (i may as well open a new thread).\r\n\r\ndr"

    a place to share strictly non-digital fonts. My mouth is watering at the idea..."
