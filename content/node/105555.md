  body: 'It''s [[http://www.exljbris.com/museosans.html|Museo Sans]]. Webfonts are
    often very easy to suss out if you have access to the page itself, so one suggestion
    for the future is to provide a link to the source. (In this case: http://www.rubenbrulat.com/)'

    and as usual for this kind of case, it would have been better to provide the [[http://www.rubenbrulat.com|website
    url]]. Most of modern menu are using webfonts and by inspecting code and css,
    answer would have come quicker."
