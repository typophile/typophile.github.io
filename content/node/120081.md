  found this image in an old french book of lettres. I was wondering if it could be
  desaturated and made into a font somehow. I do not have the resources or the know-how
  to do this. If you're able to do this and don't mind, I'd be very appreciative if
  you could send me over the .otf or .ttf file. \r\n\r\nThanks"

    body: 'I did not realize it was that difficult. Thought someone would''ve invented
      a software to plug each letter into or something. I guess it is an extremely
      unreasonable request. My mistake. I''m fifteen and am very new to the world
      of typefaces, but I love the intricacy and the aesthetic made through each font.
      I rescind my request I guess, because I do not have a budget, let alone a 5
      figure budget, to work with. '

    standard font.\r\n\r\nBut, with a bit of work this kind of look could be achieved
    by starting  with a suitable slab-serif  and adding layers and effects in Illustrator."

    there with multiple "layers" to create this effect.

    body: Wow that's awesome! I didn't realize it existed. I saw it in this old french
      book and didn't realize someone had digitalized it already. Thanks so much.

    thought, maybe it is right; it just looks so wrong to me."
