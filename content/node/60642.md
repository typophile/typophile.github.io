    logotype and I wanted to use something that is from that country. I would prefer
    to use a Sans Serif, these are all my preferences. '

    is Dutch, but lives in Berlin. And also any font by Erik Spiekermann."

  body: "Well, one could make an argument about Berthold faces, since they operated
    out of Berlin for 100 years. But they haven't been in the city for a decade and
    a half, and times and styles change. Berlin is a different place that it was 70
    years ago, 17 years ago, or maybe even 7 years ago\u2026\r\n\r\nObviously, the
    FontFont library comes to mind, as FSI is the largest typefoundry working in Berlin.
    But in addition to those good selections, there are other Berlin typeface designers
    and foundries, like primetype (http://www.prime-type.com) or Hannes von D\xF6hren,
    who is young and has quite a lot to offer (http://hvdfonts.com/). \r\n\r\nMy favorite
    Berlin designer is probably Verena Gerlach (http://www.fraugerlach.de/index.php?cat=3).
    Note that she also has typefaces in the FontFont library, as well as at primetype.
    Moreover, together with primetype's Ole Sch\xE4fer, she designed the FF City Street
    Type family that Stephen mentions above. "

    am not German per-se, but am an admirer of the Modern German aesthetic.\r\nThe
    attitude of ISOGLYPH is about humanising the somewhat geometric forms of DIN and
    ISONORM whilst retaining the performance (high words per line ratio) and open
    letterforms for clarity of type used at small sizes and for signage.It is designed
    so it can also be used as text.\r\nCurrent font is bold in nature to be able to
    accomplish the above and has a thinner Titling Alternative inside the OTF.\r\nContact
    me direct if you are interested.\r\n\r\nMichael Hernan"
