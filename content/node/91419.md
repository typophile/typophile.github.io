  designed for a luxury men\u2019s underwear brand (see details below). This is also
  my first post so if I\u2019m missing any needed info I would be happy to add.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIENT\r\nState of Nature is a Hong Kong based underwear
  label that creates premium fashion forward designs for discerning men. \r\n\r\nPROCESS\r\nThe
  aim was to create a brandmark that would visually convey the company\u2019s focus
  on the customer as well as the core values of the State of Nature brand, namely,
  comfort, unity, exclusivity, and premium design. In addition, I wanted to create
  a mark that would stand out from the sea of typical marks by competing fashion labels.
  My solution was to focus on a universal symbol that relates to the diverse nature
  of all men, rather than on State of Nature itself, as a basis for a design. Using
  the world-renowned Vitruvian Man drawing created by Leonardo da Vinci as inspiration,
  I constructed a mark based on its iconic circle and square. The logo is intended
  to embody the relationship of geometry and human physical beauty while representing
  Leonardo's attempts to relate man to nature. Lastly, I created a wordmark to balance
  the more emotional feel of the symbol with a sense of power and stability. \r\n\r\nWORDMARK\r\nFor
  the logotype I chose Verlag as a base due to its personality, geometric look and
  modernist feel. I have two options for the logotype with modified \u2018A\u2019
  and \u2018E\u2019 bars and angled arms on the \u2018T\u2019 to gain some ownership
  without unnecessary ornament. My goal was to convey a sense of gravitas in the wordmark,
  underscoring the strength of a brand based on the canons of proportion. The logotype
  also contains a classical reference within its modern design. Following the practice
  of classical and neo-classical inscriptions, the lettering on the identity uses
  the Roman \u201CV\u201D in place of the \u201CU\u201D in the word \u201CNature.\u201D
  I hoped to strike a point of balance between the modernity of luxury underwear and
  the classicism of the Vitruvian Man.\r\n\r\n[[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12583463/SON_01_Brandmark.jpg|State

  body: "Luxury underwear? Why not just use Trajan? Kidding.\r\n\r\nI like the name,
    the use of \"V\" and the Vitruvian Man\r\nidea. But the circle+square rendering
    seems to have\r\nlittle bits that won't survive - to me you need something\r\nsimpler,
    and playing with negative shapes might click.\r\n\r\nFWIW your logotype reminds
    me of Athleta's:\r\nhttp://brandsarchive.com/public/files/athleta/athleta.jpg\r\nThat
    might be a good thing though.\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm sure you'll get much better opinions\r\nfrom
    actual graphic designers - I myself only\r\nmake typefaces.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
