body: "I've seen some discussion before on here about matching Futura with a complimentary
  body face that is not itself, but it never really answered the question. I don't
  like the look of Futura in lowercase for semi longer body copy.\r\n\r\nI tried using
  some interesting pairings others have like IKEA with New Century Schoolbook, but
  my client doesn't have that earthy, warm feeling to use that. haha. The client is
  a commerical properties painter mostly. If that helps get ideas flowing.\r\n\r\nI'm
  using Futura Medium and Bold(cliche) set in uppercase for titles.\r\n\r\nWhat should
  i try for body? Sans serif suggestions are welcome as well. Maybe i shouldn't be
  so afraid of lowercase Futura, but it just irks me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for the help
  in advance."

  body: "Thanks for Beton Mr. Shinn. I think it may work and the way i use Futura
    these days i'm sure to use it again if i buy it.\r\n\r\nBergh- I have been tempted.
    I think it would be a typographic faux pas to do so though."

  body: "Try the new [[http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/hypatia/hypatia.html|Hypatia
    sans.]] There are alternates and the a and g are more appropriate for short texts.
    \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it's not yet available retail, but I think it comes bundled
    with CS3. "

  body: I recently used Hypatia. The project needed something like Futura, but I really
    didn't want to use it and I'd just downloaded Hypatia (as the selected registration
    incentive with CS3). I did use the stylistic sets to strip it down to something
    closer to Futura, but it still worked on it its own.

  body: I have not used Hypatia, but I keep getting hung up on the lower-case a. Is
    it just me?

  body: 'The lowercase a is very cute, IMO. But, like I said, I used stylistic sets
    which swapped the binocular a/g to monocular. '

    shed some light on the influences. I've come to see it as a little Kabel in the
    mix.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hypa_6511.gif]"

  body: "Wow, that looks a bit odd seeing the unicase (small cap size) alternates
    mixed in with the lower case.\r\n\r\nI had a lot of influences, which I generally
    took pains to not look at while I was working on the typeface. Kabel, Futura,
    Optima, Penumbra, and others.\r\n\r\nNote: Stylistic set #1 turns off the vestigial
    serifs, and stylistic set #2 switches to \"more geometric\" shapes for agty&.\r\n\r\nMore
