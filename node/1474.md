body: 'Hi fellows, <BR>here i have two proposals for a theater play <BR>&#34;Mr. Puntilla
  and his man Matti&#34; by B. Brecht. <BR> <BR>The story is about the life of a finnish
  wealthy man  <BR>who makes trips  around Finland for bussines. <BR>His permanent
  company to those trips is his driver Matti. <BR>Puntilla is a man who has two opposite
  personas.  <BR>On one hand he is a cold bussinesman,  <BR>but when he drinks, becomes
  generous,  <BR>open-hearted and hedonist.  <BR> <BR>The elements i should use are:  <BR>-the
  nature of Finland, <BR>-the feminine element &#40;drunk Puntilla is always  <BR>in
  love and gives wedding promisses to various women&#41;. <BR>-alcohol <BR> <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'Hi Christos. <BR> <BR>Your style is fantastic. These theater companies are
    lucky to have you. At any rate, i think the composition in the first is better
    &#40;color, balance, movement etc&#41;, but I prefer the concept in the second.
    It better shows the duality you talked about '

  body: Christos -- They are both very nice, but the one on the left has the &#34;romance&#34;.
    The mountains could create the line at the bottom, as opposed to have a perfect
    box. One thought. The title and subtitle, could they attach to the left of the
    grey box instead of the top? You could them move them down and balance a bit in
    the middle. Just thoughts.

  body: 'goodmorning and thank you for the response. <BR> <BR>Dmitry: <BR>&#34;i think
    you can put forest from the second variant into it.&#34;  <BR>-it will add too
    much noise i think &#40;and this poster is already too noisy for my taste&#41;.
    <BR>-as for the &#34;more detailed hand&#34; you are right. <BR> <BR>Randy...thanks
    for the encouraging words. <BR>I totaly agree with what you write in the 1st paragraph.
    <BR>As to apply the &#34;left&#34; hand to the 2nd poster <BR>maybe will improve
    the poster but is a matter  <BR>of policy to show it to the client like  <BR>that
    and then propose this adjustment. <BR>Also instead of making the background blue  <BR>and
    the case black i tried to make the case  <BR>grey but the impression was less
    strong. It was <BR>even less with a dark blue background. <BR> <BR>Tiffany--i
    am not sure if i understood  <BR>your proposal but i can explain my decision <BR>about
    the layout: the heavy title keeps the  <BR>horizon line and the left adjustment
    compined <BR>to the loose kerning of the subtitle and the name  <BR>of the writer,
    gives a move to the right which  <BR>follows the movement of the hand. <BR> <BR>have
    a good and shinny day  <BR>&#40;here in greece is still to shiny...lucky me&#41;
    <BR> <BR>...christos'
