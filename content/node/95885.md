body: Hi. I'm looking for some books on the topic of magazine design. I'm not quite
  sure there may be anything like a formal theory of magazine design but at least
  I guess there must be some serious books discussing topics such as covers, layouts,
  photography, etc.

    - Typography in Magazines</em>]] by Laura Meseguer looks interesting, though I
    only looked through it quickly in a bookshop the other day.\r\n\r\nI have had
    [[http://www.thamesandhudson.com/9780500515730.html|<em>The Art Director's Handbook
    of Professional Magazine Design</em>]] by Horst Moser (2003 edition) for many
    years and always found it a useful reference, though my edition is somewhat dated
    now and I do not know if there are any updates in this release.\r\n\r\nThese would
    be good starting points but with the range of magazine's available today and the
    approaches being taken, looking at a range of current editions, particularly in
    graphic design, fashion and politics, can offer the most revealing insight.\r\n\r\nAdditionally
    many magazines now produce digital editions as well as complimentary digital content.
    The website for Purple Fashion hosts a digital edition of the magazine as well
    as other text, photographic and video content. Monocle has developed a boutique
    commercial side, selling clothing, accessories and even a bicycle to compliment
    its specific target audience.\r\n\r\nYou may also find the [[http://magculture.com/blog/|magculture]]
    blog interesting."

  body: "For years before the advent of the personal computer I kept a journal of
    quotations. Most of them are on typography, but there are some verging on theory,
    that are about, or applicable to, magazine art direction and design.\r\n\r\nThe
    first is embedded in this quotation [ see the bold ]: \u201CThe word <em>magazine</em>
    comes from the old Spanish <em>magacen</em> (meaning: a store-house); which comes
    form the Arabic <em>makhazin</em>; which is the plural of <em>makhazan</em>; which,
    logically enough, means \u201Cto store up.\u201D // At the begining of the eighteenth
    century the term <em>magazine</em> was applied, first, not to periodicals, but
    to a special kind of book, a book not willing to stick to one subject only, but
    rambling all over the lot: a storehouse of all kinds of knowledge; a <strong>repository
    of miscellanea</strong>. // Today \u201CMagazine\u201D means a <em>magazine</em>
    only in English-speaking countries; in the rest of the world the term <em>magazine</em>
    is mostly used in it\u2019s original meaning of repository. In Russian <em>magazine</em>
    means a store or a shop; in Germany \u2014 a cartridge-holding part of the rifle;
    in France <em>magasin</em> is either a department store or (as in the slangy expression,
    \u201Cmagasin de blanc\u201D) a house which serves as a repository for young ladies
    of more charm than virtue. // The periodicals of our time, all over the world,
    and regardless of what they are called, are true <em>magazines</em>: that is,
    storehouses. [From M. F. Agha, \u201CReprise: On Magazines,\u201D in <em>AIGA,
    Journal of Graphic Design</em>. VIII, #3, 1985. Reprinted from the catalogue of
    <em>Magazines USA</em> for the AIGA show of 1968.\r\n\r\nWhen I taught continuing
    education courses in Magazine Design at Ryerson in Toronto in the 1990s I liked
    to play with the metaphorical possibilities of the more colourful alternate meanings
    in relation to the magazine design scene of the day.\r\n\r\nI also liked to quote
    Raymond Hawkey\u2019s \u201CGraphic Design in Newspapers\u201D (1960s; Penrose
    Annual): \u201CThe newspaper graphic designer has to be able to understand and
    respect <strong>the essential journalistic function</strong> of what he [pe: or
    she] is asked to do.\u201D\r\n\r\nFrom the great illustrator Marshall Arisman
    [\u201CArt of the Printed Page,\u201D <em>,ID </em>, March / April 1988] I lifted:
    \u201CArt directors, meantime must be willing to regard artists as contributors
    rather than as handy human drawing tools.\u201D Marshall Arisman was a great advocate
    of the illustrator's \u201Cability to visually report, observe and reflect upon
    a wide range of social, psychological and intellectual issues.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis
    ethos was in the air at the time Barry Blitt of <em>New Yorker</em> and <em>New
    York Times</em> fame \u2014 and illustrator of my typophile avatar \u2014 was
    honing his skills on the pages of magazines I was working on.\r\n\r\nOne of the
    most important precepts I tried to convey is from Jan V. White, who wrote <em>Editing
    by Design</em> and <em>Designing for Magazines</em>,\u201D both: Bowker, 1982.
    For a Folio Show Conference seminar description he wrote \u201CAssembling your
    magazine is like making a film; it is a arrangement of impressions presented in
    sequence and revealed over time \u2014 page by page or spread by spread.\u201D
    This is explored in some detail in Chapter 2 of <em>Editing by Design</em> under
    the chapter heading \u201CThe Magazine: Object in Three Dimensions.\u201D The
    books\u2019 examples are quite dated, but the precepts still hold.\r\n\r\nWe talked
    about the use of grids; working with the editorial structure of the magazine;
    typographical palettes or liveries, navigational and tagging concerns to keep
    the reader oriented; following strict formats in departments and exercising greater
    freedom in the feature well; addressing the browsing reader, and graphically and
    typographically facilitating sustained engagement with the story once he or she
    becomes immersed.\r\n\r\nPeter"

    the best possible sources many of which have been pointed out along with some
    great miscellaneous information from Peter.\r\n\r\nI already owned Editing by

    decisions. This might be an approach that would supplement textbook work with
    real-life examples. One such can be found here, for [[http://www.spd.org/2009/12/behind-the-new-york-times-maga-1.php|The

    in town after the first class, which was then Lichtmans, and select two magazines:
    one they were familiar with, and a second they weren\u2019t aware of but found
    intriguing. They were asked to buy the current copies each time they came out.
    At the end of the year they had to write and deliver a report for each on every
    aspect of magazine design we had discussed. This included figuring out the typographic
    grid, identifying the type-faces used \u2014 and their creators, as well as the
    circumstances for the creation of the fonts \u2014 determining the sizes and leading
    for each section of the magazine, determining the editorial structure of the magazine,
    how illustration, information graphics and photography were used, how departments
    and features were treated, etc. Participants also had to devise a multi-page feature
    layout the fit the design parameters of one of their magazines and were mindful
    of the Jan White, Raymond Hawkey, etc. precepts I had taught.\r\n\r\nAlmost all
    of students used the time between sessions to pace themselves, using the topic
    that had been discussed the previous week, and raised their questions at the beginning
    of the following sessions. Some students even called the art directors to get
    information first-hand.\r\n\r\nI thought of the course as a course in magazine
    design <em>literacy</em>. My experience was that there were plenty of good designers,
    but most entry-level people didn\u2019t understand magazines."
