    slightly narrower...

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nBut I can't find that either. Which font house carries PLINC
    Standard Book? House Industries? They have merchandising with that name but nothing
    that looks like a downloadable font.\r\n\r\nIf it helps, here's a description
    I found about the Libeskind book and the font choice:\r\n\r\nFor the text, they
    chose RomanSque and RomanT: two \u201Cconstructed\u201D fonts that are associated
    with computer-aided architectural design. Enlarged, they reveal the irregularities
    of their structure, and as such are a fairly accurate analogue for Libeskind\u2019s
    own work."

  body: "PLINC stands for Photolettering Inc. Some (all?) of their catalogue was acquired
    by House Industries. \r\nI think the constructed fonts \u201Cassociated with computer-aided
    architectural design\u201D are, in fact, from some CAD/plotter program and thus
    in a proprietary format.\r\nAnyway, here are some more info and photos:\r\nhttp://www.faceoutbooks.com/13853/Counterpoint-Daniel-Libeskind\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, it\u2019s better to bump/update your old thread instead of posting a
    new one:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/80206\r\n"

  body: "Thanks a lot for your response! \r\n\r\nI figured out the Photo-Lettering
    connection on my own but their site is still under construction. So I'll hold
    on for that.\r\n\r\nAs to the Faceout Books site, that was my actual starting-off
    point and where I got my initial information! I was intrigued by these stunning
    architectural fonts, and I love the look of the book, so I began to investigate
    and was surprised not to find a single mention online. As if they didn't even
    exist. Puzzling, no? Whereas they refer to them as if they were regular fonts.
    By them, I mean RomanT and RomanSque. Has anyone heard of these, I wonder?\r\n\r\nFinally,
    how does one bump/update an old thread? Now that this one is going, and you've
    been so kind to respond, I don't feel like starting from scratch...\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks again!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Aha... so they're CAD fonts. How does one convert CAD fonts to \"real\" fonts,
    i.e., fonts that will work in other programs? The designers of this book did it,
    so there must be a way.\r\n\r\n\r\nShort of that, which fonts come closest to
