		<div class="commentbody">Interesting, I&rsquo;m not sure it works, on first read I saw MWILO. Leaving that aside, the L seems too narrow; the O looks out of place, maybe you could try using a break like the A or B; the S needs some work, it appears to be tilting to the left. Does the M need that upright, because I think that is contributing to the MW reading problem. I think you can make it work but it will take a creative solution.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the reply Timd,</p>
<p>Yeah I noticed the tilt of the S after posting the image, that is definately something that I need to fix. I don&rsquo;t quite like the S to be honest I think I still need to work on the overall shape. As for the MM/MW thing, It&rsquo;s something that has been worrying me for a bit and I&rsquo;m caught as a cross-roads as to how to deal with it. The original reason why I put in the upright stem on the M was to make sure it wasn&rsquo;t confused for a W once it was flipped, but I suppose that could have proved detrimental.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put up some more variations as soon as I&rsquo;m able. In the meantime any other comments are appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The stacked m&rsquo;s also throw off the balance of the design, making it very left-heavy; when I squint I just see a big blob on the left end. Seems to me to pull this off the lettering would need to be quite light (thin) to provide more white space to loosen things up and thereby lessen the weight of those interlocing m&rsquo;s.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, I have made a few variations on the logo, I implemented Tim&rsquo;s idea of removing the upright stem from the M and also following Jason&rsquo;s suggestion made the letters thinner to increase negative space. For now I am only working on the MMILO part because that seems to be the area that requires the most attention.</p>
<p>I am also toying with the idea of small embellishments to suggest the idea of rotation. See what you think of these: <a href="http://www.mmilolabs.com/imgs/mmilo.gif">http://www.mmilolabs.com/imgs/mmilo.gif</a></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m in love with either of them but there might be something there. I&rsquo;m starting to feel that the font might not be the best, I&rsquo;ll try making something more condensed hopefully that will take some of the weight out of the M&rsquo;s.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">i think the first idea with the two m&rsquo;s is good, but the implmentation needs some work. The name «mmilo:labs» has so much signifcance to it, it shouldn&rsquo;t be tampered with. I would have left the name quite straight, and instead treat the «folded» m&rsquo;s as a separate logo. it has many nice connotations: folded hands, intertwining, holdding hands etc. as it is now, the logo collapses under the wheight of too many good ideas. how necessary is the &lsquo;:&rsquo;?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The old direction was more playful but also more serious feeling in that it was tapping into reductive modernism. The new direction does pop but I think it relies on color too much. Whatever you make I want to encourage you to make sure it works in B&amp;W first and then think about color. I think this one feels like SF, CA in the the early 90&rsquo;s just because I associate the face with that time. BTW - what about just scanning a ballpoint pen or pencil sketch? Or some other one-off method. Whipped cream?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You guys are both right to a degree, I like Dan&rsquo;s thoughts about the logo communicating a clear message but Eben is 100% correct that the message is supposed to be arty &amp; experimental.</p>
<p>Herein lies the problem, I&rsquo;m trying to create a logo that conveys form over function and yet still remains functional. As much as I liked the interlocking M&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s not much point when noone will understand what the logo is sayng. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m trying out different avenues to find what will strike the best balance.</p>
<p>If you guys have any thoughts, or can think of any logos that fit in with what I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish let me know :)</p>
<p>Again thanks for the keen interest guys, I will most definately keep working on this, I&rsquo;m having a blast doing this with your help.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m glad you brought back the initial look. I think they&rsquo;re more interesting than the red&amp;black, which seems to have less personality (though I don&rsquo;t know you, so who&rsquo;s to say the other isn&rsquo;t more &lsquo;you&rsquo;?).</p>
<p>The number of &lsquo;legs&rsquo; is disorienting. My eye has a hard time resolving them into anything, and as a result I read them as ornamentation of a sort, like a visual foil for the &lsquo;i&rsquo; so I read it as &lsquo;ilo:labs&rsquo; now.</p>
<p>I prefer the second one because you have more forms to work with. I&rsquo;d suggest making each &rsquo;m' distinct and using that first leg with the sharp corner twice, once for each &rsquo;m'. Also, the light grey might be a bit too light, depending on how much control you have over its use.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Chris, if you could sort out the m so it is still abstract enough to please yourself but legibable enough to read as an m,  I think you would have a really nice logo! 
That &amp; fix that s! I am looking foreward to the next iteration. BTW - maybe you should work in just b/w and leave the grey &amp; color to later on.</p>
<p>What if gave the m a sort of Lead-in on the left side, almost like a serif in the text m. Or you could take your &lsquo;a&rsquo; make a copy, flip it horizontally &amp; have a kind of ram&rsquo;s head m that uses the roundness of the other letters again. Actually I made some m&rsquo;s just for fun. If you want I will post them for you. Really there are a ton of creative ways to make your m.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the verticals at the start of the logo are distracting, you could make a ligature of the mm (possibly sharing the last and first vertical of each m). The ram&rsquo;s heads are an interesting approach although it is probably too far round, the il ligature, for example, the dot of the i is not centred on the vertical. That s is looking good I wonder if a sharper change of direction at the top might be necessary, I don&rsquo;t see the point of not having the same terminal on the l of labs as most of the other characters. Definitely worth persisting with this look.

<p>As for you posting your example here Eben, you don&rsquo;t even need to ask buddy, post away. speaking of the logo, I think most likely I&rsquo;ll end up sticking to 6A. I like the extra flourish on the &ldquo;m&rdquo; in the 1-4 series but I feel that it makes the design look a little too &ldquo;girly&rdquo; and limits design potential (no offense to the ladies out there :P).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Good Point. MMILO is an abbreviation of my full name. As for the kind of work I intend to put up on the site, it&rsquo;s pretty varied. I&rsquo;m mainly interested in web design and vector based illustration, but I dabble in Flash programming, typography, conceptual illustration and digital painting. That&rsquo;s why there is a &ldquo;labs&rdquo; suffixed on to the name because the site is mainly about me experimenting with different ideas.</p>
<p>The website has three goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Outlet for general experimentation</li>
<li>Showcasing some work</li>
<li>Putting up a portfolio so I can hopefully find some sort of employment after my degree is completed.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry I was vague about what I was trying to accomplish, but I hope I have given enough of a back story now for people to get a better idea of what the concept behind the logo is.</p>
