body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm working on rather experimental font - each glyph
  consists of many horizontal stripes (individual paths/contours) \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_5887.png]\r\n\r\nIs
  there any way to re-arrange thier hierarchy/order?\r\n\r\nFor exmple the top contour
  would be #1 and the last one #23 ? (or otherwise)\r\n\r\nI've figured out  how to
  display their numbers (ctrl + F7) but how to change their order?\r\n\r\nThumby and
  time consuming solution would be probably \"cut and paste\" in the right order but
  I'm looking for something more effective.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated,\r\n(v)"

    some clicking, but it's working fine.\r\nI'm not experienced in scripting at all,
    luckily the number of glyphs in my font is not that high.\r\n\r\nThe whole sorting
    \"problem\" is probably not that big deal - I was rather concerned about potential
    interpolating issues.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n(v)"

  body: "In the mode you\u2019ve probably been already, the one you set the starting
    points from, right-clicking on each contour should give you a contextual menu
    with some very basic contour-ordering commands. But it won\u2019t be very effective
    either. I haven\u2019t done much FontLab scripting in particular, but looking
    at your contours, just finding the lowest <em>y</em> coordinate in each contour
    and sorting the contours by this value should do, algorithmically.\r\n\r\nIs there
    a reason why do you want them sorted? Because the only reason I myself can think
    of is the file size, as the bigger the distances between points, the bigger the
    numbers that need to be stored. In case of a TrueType binary, for example, the
    threshold is at 256 font units, above which storage requirements for a particular
    distance double, but that\u2019s still mere two bytes. Machine movement of some
    kind?"
