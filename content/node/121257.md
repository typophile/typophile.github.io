body: "I'm trying to identify the font used in \"new hope\". I think it may be Gotham,
  but the bar on the \"e\" seems to be the same width as the rest of the type. If
  this is bold, and if it is Gotham, I have seen the bar on the \"e\" thinner when
  it is set to bold, black or ultra. \r\n\r\nIs it a typeface other than Gotham? \r\nIs
  it possible that the designer adjusted the bar?\r\nAre my eyes playing tricks on
  me? \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any help in ID'ing this font, thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/new_hope_3830.jpg]"

  body: Looks like Gotham to me as well, Medium weight I'd say. Logo /e crossbar looks
    thinner than the rest of the /e, just like you spotted on Gotham.

  body: Thank you Ryuk. I don't see how the /e crossbar is thinner, maybe I don't
    have as good an eye. After some research this morning, I started to think it may
    be Avenir. Thank you for the help, it is appreciated.

  body: Also thought instantly to Avenir but if you want to match 'COMMUNITY' word
    with a single typeface, Gotham is the only one I know that could fit both lettering
    at the same time mainly because of /M pointy and above baseline centre vertex,
    a specific earmark of Gotham.
