  a text that will take me from beginners' exercises to working on some serious letterforms
  before sending me out on my own. I've decided I want to get that sense of how the
  strokes go from thin to thick and vice versa.\r\n\r\nOh, something I've been meaning
  to ask about ... I'm a lefty. Do I have to jump thru hoops figuring out the reverse
  of instructions from one of these books? Or is it just the same moves with the other
  hand?"

  body: "Pilot Parallel are good starter pens (in fact pretty good full stop) since
    the nibs are created with two parallel plates, rather than a more recognisable
    nib, I would imagine they would suit a lefty as much as a righty.\r\nhttp://www.studioartshop.com/acatalog/info_672_1.html\r\n\r\nIt
    seems Rotring have dropped their lefthanded range, but there maybe something on
    ebay or in a dusty stockroom somewhere, the righthanded versions are lovely to
    use but a little sterile in the quality of their line, depends what you want from
    your calligraphy.\r\nhttp://www.blotspens.co.uk/acatalog/Calligraphy_Rotring_Art_Pens_22.html\r\n\r\nOr
    there are specialist lefthanded sites \u2013 I don\u2019t know about the quality
    of instruction and pens but they are written with the lefthanded in mind.\r\nhttp://www.anythingleft-handed.co.uk/acatalog/master_class_calligraphy_set.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.anythingleft-handed.co.uk/acatalog/left_hand_calligraphy.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.clas.co.uk/lefthanders.html\r\n\r\nBy
    the way has anyone used a Yoropen? They look like fun, I am sure I saw a similar
    product designed for a competition by Seymour Powell.\r\nhttp://www.yoropen.com/\r\n\r\nTim"
