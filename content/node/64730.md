  a subtable (0x10b20)\"\r\n\r\nI'm learning and trying to understand from past posts
  here what (a) I've done and (b) what can be done, but I'd just like to ask another
  question.\r\n\r\nWhat does the Red Numerical Value in the Kerning Pairs list represent?
  (trouble I'm guessing)\r\n\r\nAnd if that is a red flag for trouble, what's the
  best way to fix. The kerning seems right, but it's red?\r\nI've looked through Manuals
  and looked around here.\r\n\r\nAny wisdom in layman terms would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nDJ"

    These may be intentional as when, for example, the pair T\xE8 might have a value
    that differs from the class kerning of [T\u2026] class to [e\u2026] class."
