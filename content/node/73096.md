  or non-readable?\r\nDoes they look to you more like some ligatures or recognizable
  letters \"B\" and \"D\" ?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BD_3488.png]\r\n\r\nThanks."

    in overall layout and whole concept.\r\n\r\nA couple of people told me that /B/
    and /D/ would look very strange and not enough recognizable as those letters.
    So that started bugging me more and more.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kofer_font_4259.png]"

    two characters just as a single curve? (ie, not separate strokes; keeping that
    characteristic curl at the foot, but then running straight on into the bowl?)"
