  it isn't strictly a 'Type ID' question, but others seem to have started similar
  topics here so I guess I'm in the clear.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a book cover which
  takes (adapts, really) its title from an old, pulpy/poorly printed boys adventure
  book called \"Tom in the Andamans\".\r\n\r\nI'm looking to set the title for the
  book in a similar face, but it looks to be a hand-lettered job.\r\n\r\nSo could
  anyone suggest equivalents or near-matches for the type in the attached sample?
  I'm more concerned with the parts of the title in caps, less so the italics. The
  off-centre O and swash on the S are of particular interest.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/andamans-typesample_4704.jpg]\r\n\r\nA
  little worried that not much like this will have been digitised to be honest, but
  it's worth a try...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\npat\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think I might go with Hadriano \u2013 while not a perfect match, it does
    retain much of the feel of the original. Already own Goudy Heavyface, and I'd
    considered it earlier,  but it just feels too rigid...\r\n\r\nThanks all for your
