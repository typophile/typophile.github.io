  It's an extract of lettering from an NHS No Smoking booklet I got sent to my business
  address. I'm sure I've seen it somehwhere, but it's eluding me... anyone care to
  take a guess?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nSteve"

      I'm surprised this typface is not more popular... I think it is a good challenger
      to meta and din in a number of applications.\r\n\r\nKindest regards"

  body: "Happy to help. Consider <a href=\"http://vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/Example+About/\">Apex
    New</a> if you're planning to purchase. It's an improvement over the original.
    From the author:\r\n\r\n<em>...All weights of the type have been revised, and
    everything heavier than Book has been completely redrawn. The bold weights had
    previously \"closed up\", especially at smaller sizes; the new bold weights are
    more open, with subtle contrast...</em>\r\n\r\nPerhaps Chester Jenkins, who is
    known to post here, could offer more info?"
