  my new Vista 64 bit.\r\nI've long used Extensis Suitcase to install and uninstall
  all sorts of fonts, with no problems whatsoever. Recently, I migrated to Vista 64-bit,
  and Adobe CS4.\r\n\r\nI seem to have no problem installing and uninstalling True
  Type fonts via Suitcase 11, but when I install Type 1 fonts, it says the font is
  installed (there is a little yellow bullet next to the font to indicate that all
  is well), but the Type 1 font doesn't actually get installed into Windows. Naturally,
  it does not show up in Photoshop's font menu either.\r\n\r\nI also tried using several
  other font managers (AMP Font Viewer, Bitsteam Font Navigator), but with exactly
  the same results. I have no problem installing/uninstalling True Type fonts, but
  not Type 1.\r\n\r\nI then tried to manually install a Type 1 font, using Windows
  itself. That installed fine, and the font now showed up in Photoshop's menu. However,
  I now can't uninstall it.\r\nWindows' native font utility tells me the Type 1 font
  is uninstalled, but it still shows up in Photoshop's font menu. I can't get rid
  of it.\r\n\r\nCould anyone possibly tell me what's going on? Are there gremlins
  in my computer?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\nD."

    website.\r\n\r\nI use Bitstream Font Navigator, but it won't even pretend to install
    Type 1 fonts. I get an ATM error. TrueType and OpenType are fine."

  body: "A little searching brought this up from an Adobe Technote:\r\n\r\nType 1
    fonts don't list in Creative Suite 2 and 3 applications (Windows XP Professional
    x64 and Vista x64)\r\nIssue\r\n\r\nType 1 fonts installed in the Fonts control
    panel on Windows XP Professional x64 or Windows Vista x64 do not list in the font
    menus of Adobe Creative Suite 2 applications.\r\n\r\nFonts display as expected
    in other Windows applications (for example,Character Map, Wordpad).\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nMove
    copies of the Type 1 fonts to the Common Files\\Adobe\\Fonts folder.\r\n\r\n   1.
    In the Fonts control panel, select the Type 1 fonts that you want to move.\r\n
    \  2. Select Edit > Copy.\r\n   3. Open the Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Adobe\\Fonts
    folder.\r\n   4. Select Edit > Paste to copy the font files into the Adobe\\Fonts
    folder. \r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\n\r\nType 1 fonts installed in the Fonts
    control panel on Windows XP Professional and Vista x64 do not list in the font
    menus of Adobe Creative Suite 2 and Creative Suite 3 applications. Creative Suite
    applications can access Type 1 fonts installed in the Adobe\\Fonts folder.\r\n\r\nOpenType
    fonts from Adobe, both TrueType- and OpenType-flavored (.TTF and .OTF) display
    and work as expected in Creative Suite 2 and Creative Suite 3 applications when
    installed in the Windows Fonts control panel."

  body: "Type 1 fonts come with two files (at least): a PFB file that contains just
    the outlines, and a PFM file that contains metrics and kerning. It seems one of
    the two is deleted/moved/managed and the other stays put. I can imagine your system
    getting upset about that.\r\n\r\nInstalling/removing fonts under XP (my system)
    copies and deletes both files at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to use the
    fonts exclusively for CS4, you can locate the CS4 Fonts folder -- somewhere inside
    the CS4 shared stuff -- and put the Type 1's there. They won't be manageable,
    though."

  body: Dima, have a look at this thread -- [[http://www.adobeforums.com/webx?128@@.59b61a73|Unable
    to install Type 1 fonts in Windows XP]] -- on Adobe's User-to-user forums. It
    might we related with the problems you're having.
