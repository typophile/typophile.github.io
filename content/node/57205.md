  I've read that it is a measure of the fonts em, but in a practical sense, it seems
  to be more a measure of the font's height. I am using Illustrator for measurements
  - comparing a 14pt line with various 14pt fonts, and it seems to be match the font
  height (decender to ascender/stem) with a bit of leading included (Amount varying
  from font to font). This seems quite counter-intuitive as this surely means that
  when adding leading, you are adding it to an already-leaded font.\r\n\r\nThanks."
