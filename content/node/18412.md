  After creating outlines and preparing OT features when I generate font it shows
  me TTF font file icon. As a test I take standard Windows OT font, import in FontLab,
  make no chages, generate as OT TTF font and the same result - TTF icon insted of
  \"O\" OpenType font icon. \r\nBut when I generate OTF (PS flavored) file everithing
  OK with icon.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAkhra"
