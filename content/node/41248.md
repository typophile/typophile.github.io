  but I can't be sure as I don't understand it :)\r\n\r\nIt appears in this sentence
  about bad dictionary layout:\r\n\r\n<em>Vores egen erfaring er, at der findes ordb\xF8ger
  af h\xF8j kvalitet, som har et s\xE5 uroligt <strong>l\xE6sebillede</strong> og
  en s\xE5 lille skrift, at brugen er vanskeliggjort.</em>\r\n\r\nwhich comes from
  this paper: http://netordbogen.asb.dk/Lit/Hermes/H04_02.pdf\r\n\r\nI can see that
  it comes from \"read\" and \"picture\" but beyond that I can't make heads or tails
  of it.  If anyone could explain what it means, I'd be much obliged."

    here in the meaning <cite>reading metaphor</cite>. As far as I can see (from it's
    other uses), <cite>l\xE6sebillede</cite> refers to a specific reading situation
    or context (including the reading material), so it could be translated to <cite>readability</cite>
    (as opposed to legibility)."

    writing as being 'troubled' or 'concerning', citing that the words are so small
