  body: "I'll be interested to see if anyone can answer this. It seems like something
    Hermann Zapf could do, but I can't find a font of his like this. The duplicated
    letters seem to me to be identical, so it suggests that it is a font, but it looks
    like a new one to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Your faith is touching, but some things may not be commercially available,
    even if they are fonts. I have not found much that I can say is even very close
    to this, and I have been looking, believe me.\r\n\r\nSo far the best alternatives
    I can suggest are <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/scrivano/\">Scrivano</a>,
    by Ricardo Esteves Gomes, and then what at first seems like an odd choice: <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/post-antiqua-be/\">Post Antiqua</a>,
    an old calligraphic typeface from 1932, by Herbert Post. If you add serifs to
    this it resembles the inscription lettering better than anything else I have seen
    so far.\r\n\r\nI am still looking, but the fact that this is all you have gotten
    for answers suggests that this just isn't a font that anyone knows.\r\n\r\n- Mike
    Yanega\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My last suggestion (for now) is Canada Type's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/messenger/\">Messenger</a>,
    which is a mix of two old calligraphic typefaces. If you backslanted this, using
    some of the alternate forms, the feeling would be similar, if not the specific
    details.\r\n\r\nI just don't think the answer will turn out to be a commercial
    font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    trying to help. \r\n\r\nBrioso looks exquisite, and so does Messenger. Never seen
    either one before, thank you for the introduction."
