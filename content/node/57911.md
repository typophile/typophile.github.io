  body: "That's a ridiculous request, you expect people to hunt down the book for
    you?\r\n\r\nThat said, it seems to be a cut of Baskerville, most likely the metal
    Monotype variety. Even so, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/baskerville/\">Bitstream</a>
    seems to be the closest digital version (the narrow y and the shape of the question
    mark are markers), although <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-new-baskerville/itc-new-baskerville/\">ITC
    New Baskerville</a> also seems close."
