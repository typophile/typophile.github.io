  Apple's use of fonts down the road.  \r\n\r\nSenior vice President Scott Forstall,
  who many thought might be the next CEO when Tim Cook eventually retires, has lost
  his job. The Apple press release puts it more delicately \u2014 \"Scott Forstall
  will be leaving Apple next year and will serve as an advisor to CEO Tim Cook in
  the interim\" \u2014 but his duties have been reassigned to other vice-presidents
  and it's likely that he's being kept on for a few months as \"an advisor\" just
  for contractual reasons.\r\n\r\nForstall was senior vice president of iOS Software,
  and his duties included overseeing software interfaces.  Jonathan  Ive (Apple's
  senior designer) will now be in charge of interface design. It's been previously
  known that Ive and Forstall had very different views on interface design.\r\n\r\nTime
  will tell if Ive makes any typeface-related changes now that he's in charge.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Scott-Forstall_4614.jpg]"

    am not sure what you mean by that. I use a Mac for personal work but my employer
    is PC all the way. My work PC renders type very poorly compared to my Mac. I have
    done every thing I can think of to optimize type rendering on my work PC but it
    is still nowhere near my Mac for quality. Granted, I am but a small cog in a big
    machine and don't have full admin privileges, but really, it you have to be a
    rocket scientist (with full admin privileges) to get decent type rendering out
    of your computer your computer has room for improvement. \r\n\r\nJust sayin'.
    \r\n\r\nI'm betting Ive doesn't give enough of a darn to do anything drastically
    awful... Not that I have a clue, but who cares about type? Actually... External
    antennas up the hoo-ha all day long, but type? Not even half as sexy as external
    antennas.\r\n"

  body: "Apple ordered to re-write 'inaccurate' Samsung statement\r\n\r\nApple has
    48 hours to re-write a statement on its website relating to its design rights
    dispute with Samsung, UK judges have ruled.\r\n\r\nApple was forced on 18 October
    to publish a message making it clear that Samsung had not infringed the iPad's
    registered design.\r\n\r\nHowever Samsung complained the statement Apple had posted
    did not comply with the court order.\r\n\r\nJudges agreed and have told Apple
    it must be removed within 24 hours.\r\n\r\nA new, compliant version must then
    be posted.\r\n\r\nMichael Beloff QC, representing Apple, told judges that the
    company had thought that it had complied with the court order.\r\n\r\n\"It's not
    designed to punish,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It's not designed to make us grovel. The
    only purpose must be to dispel commercial uncertainty.\"\r\n\r\nHe asked that
    the company be given 14 days to post the replacement - but the request was firmly
    denied.\r\n\r\nLord Justice Longmore told Mr Beloff: \"We are just amazed that
    you cannot put the right notice up at the same time as you take the other one
    down.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robin Jacob added: \"I would like to see the head of Apple
    [Tim Cook] make an affidavit about why that is such a technical difficulty for
    the Apple company.\"\r\n\r\nApple told the BBC it did not want to comment further.\r\n'Horse's
    mouth'\r\n\r\nSamsung complained that the notice posted by Apple was \"inaccurate
    and misleading\" because it added comments about other rulings in Germany and
    the US that had gone in the iPad-maker's favour.\r\n\r\n\"This has received enormous
    publicity and has perpetuated confusion as to Samsung's entitlement to market
    the Galaxy tablet computers in issue,\" a Samsung lawyer said in a written statement
    to judges.\r\n\r\n\"It has created the impression that the UK court is out of
    step with other courts.\"\r\n\r\nThe UK's ruling applies to the whole of the EU.\r\nSamsung
    Galaxy Tab 10 A UK judge said Samsung's product was not as \"cool\" as the iPad,
    and would not be mistaken for it\r\n\r\nThe court order is the latest twist in
    an ongoing legal saga involving the two companies.\r\n\r\nApple brought the case
    to the UK courts, alleging that Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10 had infringed the design
    of its iPad.\r\n\r\nBut in July, Judge Colin Birss disagreed on the grounds that
    Samsung's product was not as \"cool\".\r\n\r\nHis ruling meant that Apple was
    denied the opportunity to impose a sales ban on Samsung's products.\r\n\r\nApple
    was unsuccessful in appealing the ruling, and was ordered to place a notice on
    its website, newspapers and magazines explaining that Samsung had not infringed
    its designs.\r\n\r\nThe intention, judges said, was not to make Apple \"grovel\",
    but to remove \"commercial uncertainty\" surrounding Samsung's products.\r\n\r\n\"A
    consumer might well think: 'I had better not buy a Samsung - maybe it's illegal
    and if I buy one it may not be supported',\" Sir Robin said.\r\n\r\n\"Apple itself
    must (having created the confusion) make the position clear: that it acknowledges
    that the court has decided that that these Samsung products do not infringe its
    registered design.\r\n\r\n\"The acknowledgement must come from the horse's mouth.\"\r\n\r\nfrom

    they will be crap again.  In ten years I bet the stock is down to $10, and the
    company opens their designs up to other manufacturers as they did in the PowerPC
    era.
