  body: Wow, you guys are fast. Thanks for the suggestions, ITC Ronda kind of looks
    like what I&#39;m looking for. Can anyone suggest any freeware fonts, though?
    I&#39;m not doing this as a professional project, but just kind of a quick thing
    I wanted to whip up for a compilation CD I&#39;m burning. <BR> <BR>BTW, for some
    great Japanese pop punk music, check out The Pillows &#40; http://sl4.zapto.org/allmusic/The%20Pillows/Happy%20Bivouac/
