    there are many more. That doesn't mean your friend can't stick with their concept,
    they just need to find a way to distinguish it from all the other bubble logos.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    they could make the accent on the A more of a feature, for example try having
    the bubbles growing out from the top of the A. The bubbles have been done, but
    I'm sure they can be explored a bit further to create something more original."
