  body: It looks like one of the better handwriting fonts I&#39;ve seen. <BR>Wish
    I knew what it was.

  body: The individual letters match <a href="http://www.fontfiles.com/Fonts/Detailed/660.html">Riverside</a>,
    however, Riverside isn&#39;t &#34;squished together&#34; right - maybe one of
    you experts can help me here - I think the correct term is kerning ... right?
    I am learning a little more every day.

    in the word &#34;Aida&#34; in the logo on the left and in the photo.  They don&#39;t
    appear to match.  '

  body: Wow.... <BR> <BR>I did not think this would go this far.... <BR>Somebody who
    is typesetting for Aida Candies asked me if I knew the font. She already recreated
    their logo part, so we simply needed the name of the font so that she can re-typeset
    the rest. <BR> <BR>I guess this is the power of Typophile.... Thank you everybody!
