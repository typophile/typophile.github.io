body: "I'm on a project in FrameMaker, and the client wants MetaBook-Roman for all
  the text.  I paid for two separate downloads:  a TrueType/OpenType version, and
  a second purchase of the Type1/Postscript version (for Macintosh).  The second one
  almost works, but not quite.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM:  MetaBookLF-Roman is a plain, sans
  serif font. No Bold or Oblique style options.  MetaBoldLF-Roman is always bold,
  no oblique available. I cannot select specific words or phrases and emphasize their
  importance by styling them as bold or italic.  I can choose the Underscore style,
  but that's not the emphasis I prefer.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:  Buy a third version of the
  font for $229 and hope it provides the style options I'm accustomed to.  \r\n\r\nQuestions:
  Does anyone know where I can buy the $229 version?  Can anyone report that the $229
  version does allow styling to be imposed manually?\r\n\r\nI really don't understand
  the trimmed version of my post.  Hope it all gets through. Thanks, and if this is
  the wrong question for this audience, never mind.....  --Scottie"

  body: "I really hesitate to answer, because I don't know FrameMaker at all. I thought
    it was a pretty sophisticated program, and would support OpenType. But whatever.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is confusing is the statement that the client wants only ROMAN. You mean they
    won't accept italic, but would accept a sloped roman? If that is true, and if
    FrameMaker won't allow you to slope the roman (even as a PostScript command),
    I'd think you are out of luck, as FontFont doesn't make a \"sloped roman\" Meta,
    just an italic.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways to emphasize words, of course -- letterspaced
    small caps being one, but all have their downside."

    body: "Your answer is helpful. One factor in all this is that Adobe has stopped
      developing FrameMaker for the Macintosh.  The Mac version I have is 7.0, and
      there's a Windows version 7.2.  I don't know whether the fact that I'm on a
      Mac platform makes a difference.  I have tried the OpenType version of MetaBook,
      and it does work in Frame, EXCEPT for the apostrophe and quotation mark characters.
      \ Perhaps because I have smart/curly turned on?\r\n\r\nI see now that the only
      way to get what I want is to spend the $229.\r\n\r\nThanks for your response
      to my question.  --Scottie"

  body: "Not sure why you bought a Postscript version for Mac when the Opentype version
    works on both Windows and Mac.\r\n\r\nMeta is available at fontshop.com. All you
    purchased is one weight, the roman. The Bold and Italic are separate weights because
    the designer(s) have to redraw all the characters for each weight, requiring extra
    work and thus justifying charging separate prices for each weight.\r\n\r\nThe
    $229 price is for a package of weights, typically between 4-8 weights. Usually
    the package is cheaper than buying all the weights separately (buying in bulk
    if you will). I would recommend the Opentype version because you will have a huge
    amount of characters in one font (oldstyle characters, lining figures, smallcaps).
    Even if Framemaker doesn't support all the Opentype features that Adobe CS2 programs
    do, it still makes sense for when you eventually upgrade.\r\n\r\nAs for the client
    specifying \"Meta Roman,\" I think they just mean Meta and that most of the text
    be set in Roman. \r\n\r\nMeta Opentype version at $235\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11560.0.0"
