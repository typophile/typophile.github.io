    Is there some special way to id script fonts?\r\nThank you so, so much."

  body: "If you have Photoshop or some other image editing software, create a clean
    black and white version of your image. Try to get the type as solid/black as possible,
    and the background as white as possible without blasting out any details of your
    type. Ideally, the letters should be at least 100 pixels tall.\r\n\r\nFor script
    fonts, you also need to separate/create a gap between the letters so each glyph
    can be recognized by  visual search software. Not really an issue with your sample,
    however.\r\n\r\nwhatfontis.com does a decent job of font matching, especially
    for \u201Cfreemium\u201D fonts. You upload your image, identify the letters, and
    let it do its thing (you need to have at least two letters to search on for the
    free version; searches on one letter alone require registration). The higher resolution
    and clearer the image, the better luck you\u2019ll have. Note that the best match
    may not be listed first.\r\n\r\nFind My Font, available for sale at Findmyfont.com,
    does an even better job of matching, and has a scissors tool that allows you to
    define individual letters in a line of script (no image editing required). It,
    too, works best with a clean black and white image at a decent resolution. The
    best matches are listed in descending order.\r\n\r\nWhattheFont on myfonts.com
    only works for commercial typefaces that Myfonts sells, and even if the typeface
    is offered for sale on the site I find its matching capabilities to be limited."

  body: Thank you immensely for taking the time to give me some wonderful pointers.
    Yes, I have Photoshop, and I do use it. I didn't know about any identifiers except
    whatthefont.com and you're right about its shortcomings. I really am in your debt.
    Thank you, and Happy New Year!
