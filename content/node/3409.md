body: I designed this simple logo for a non profit organisation. <BR>They wanted something
  informal, cheap to produce and 3D looking. <BR>The palm tree is their symbol and
  they operate in an area littered <BR>with art deco buildings. <BR>The logo had to
  be scalable, keeping the same feel from a small <BR>blotch of fax ink to a wall
  size banner. <BR> <BR>I gave up on anything with gradients generated with 3D studio
  or <BR>the likes and ended up doing the highlighs on the oily shapes manually.  <BR>I
  used dark green since it&#39;s a palm tree. It&#39;s already abstract  <BR>enough
  as it is. Just black and green to keep printing costs down. <BR> <BR>The typeface
  is Willow from Tony Forster. It&#39;s from 1990 but it&#39;s <BR>inspired from turn
  of the century arts and craft in Austria. <BR>Not really art deco but everyone except
  folks here think it is. <BR>I came across this font by mistake ramdomly browsing
  on MyFonts. <BR>It was also cheap &#40;$21&#41; although it seems to have doubled
  in price <BR>this past week. <BR>I think it works in this context and the customer
  loved it but what <BR>do I know? I&#39;m really a novice here with most of my knowledge
  <BR>acquired this past year online and browsing books at Borders. <BR>I don&#39;t

  body: Bernard, I don&#39;t know what the first two blobs mean. I would work on the
    palm tree, it isn&#39;t graceful. It would be a great logo for a softball team.
    You also might look at the typeface Mostra, it was based on art deco designs unlike
    the face you are using here.  The face you are using is more of an Art Nouveau
    era. It is a good start, I look forward to see your progress

  body: Maybe my lack of graphic design senstivity is getting me here, but I really
    like what you have so far! Yes, it doesn&#39;t look like a palm tree, and yes,
    it does remind of a paw print &#40;a good association though&#41;, but most of
    all it&#39;s like a really friendly -and tasty- alien plant form. Something you
    would squeeze to get the most delicious juice! It&#39;s not 3D is a cheesy way
    - it just has a nice depth and blobby dimensionality. <BR> <BR>I also like the
    A&amp;C font &#40;just a darker weight if possible&#41; - but the Trade Gothic
    has got to go. I would lose the two smaller blobs too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'I obviously need to redraw the paw print.. ugh I meant palm tree. Thanks
    for the feedback. <BR> <BR>The customer wants the globular look. It&#39;s like
    an oil or water drop that is shown growing into a palm tree or person, but not
    a paw print. They are more interested in something esthetic and unique rather
    than something with obvious meaning. <BR>I think I&#39;ll play around with uneven
    palms for my next attempt. I can&#39;t narrow the trunk otherwise it will look
    like a pot plant. <BR> <BR>I did play around with quite a few classic art deco
    era typefaces but their clean geometric shapes don&#39;t work well with an amorphous
    logo IMHO. <BR>The organic feel of turn of the century arts &amp; craft or Art
    Nouveau &#40;I never figured out the difference&#41; seems to work better with
    oil slicks. <BR>I really like Willow here. It&#39;s borderline too whimsical but
    the organisation helps the homeless and low income residents so it was important
    to make it friendly and non corporate looking. I&#39;m almost ready to throw away
    the logo just to keep the typeface.  <BR> <BR>Scott: Could you please expand on
    why Willow doesn&#39;t go with a 3D shape? Surely you don&#39;t mean adding bevel
    or shadows. What are fonts that would fit the bill 3D wise? <BR> <BR>Hrant: Willow
    has only one weight. I wouldn&#39;t make it heavier anyway since the lettering
    would then stand out too much with respect to the logo. <BR>I had to darken the
    colour of the green for that same reason &#40;using gray for the typeface wasn&#39;t
    an option to keep costs down&#41;. <BR>What type would you recommend instead of
    Trade Gothic? Associating typefaces is one area where I need more experience.
    I&#39;m at the very beginning of developing a feel for it. My background is in
    technology, not visual design. <BR> <BR>Thanks all for you time. <BR>New logo
    to follow in a few hours, that is if I can work through the F1 Grand Prix ruckus.

    of the Viennese Secessionist style. The work of Scottish architect Charles Rennie
    Mackintosh inspired this condensed sans serif style with its rough edges and selection
    of alternative and ligatured letters. Due to renewed interest in the arts and
    crafts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Willow will enjoy widespread
    promotional application. Designed by Tony Forster, one of Europe'
