  font.\r\n\r\nYou know how whenever you went to the skating rink or the carnival,
  the snackbars would always have backlit signs with plastic letters that looked like
  this:\r\n\r\nhttp://i304.photobucket.com/albums/nn191/codytebaldi/menuboard.jpg\r\n\r\nIs
  there a font I could obtain which is identical to this lettering style?  Helvetica
  looks close, but I'm not sure it's a 100% match.  Perhaps someone a bit more studied
  in typefaces could identify the font?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance..."

  body: I don't think you'll find a digital font that matches this perfectly as the
    forms were probably created specifically for these letters. Helvetica comes close,
    as would many in <a href="http://fontfeed.com/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica/">this
    list</a>.
