body: "I did a poor job describing what I wanted in my first post - and I apologize
  for that. So I have included a sample of what I am looking for. Any face that combines
  elements like this, or something similar. Does this exist? I am not looking for
  junky fonts. Its important that it is a well constructed face. \r\n\r\nI would really
  appreciate the input of an expert who wants to share his or her knowledge and help
  me to find something close. Thanks. \r\n\r\nJeff"

  body: Your sample looks like Goudy Oldstyle with Bodoni-like serif at the bottom.
    Hmm. A Venetian old style with certain modern characteristics... <a href="http://emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PVenLi.html">Vendetta</a>
    kind of fits that description.

  body: Mark - you are awsome! Vendetta is very close to what I was envisioning. If
    you know any others that are similar - please pass those my way also. Thanks so
    much for your help.
