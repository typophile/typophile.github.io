    I\u2019d say it\u2019s not a font but lettering, based on Akzidenz Grotesk Medium."

    first time I see that font, but maybe the other font was similar.\r\n\r\nDoes
    somebody know a font what a little bit looks like this (outlined, similar amount
    of roughness, no shadows), even if it's not exactly the same? But the more similar,
    the better, off course."

    type of font, sometimes, and found this. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.wwzapper.com/fontid2.png\r\n\r\nMust
    be a 'real' font, in opposite to the first one I had posted, and it's quite similar.
    Does somebody know this one? Would be a nice second choice. :)"

    and search for \u2018sketch\u2019 or \u2018sketched\u2019 and tons of similar
    fonts should appear.\r\n\r\nEdit: Sketchetik for instance is a sketched version
    of Helvetica, and the Light weight is free. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hiekkagraphics/sketchetik/light/"
