  body: OK, Times New Roman looks close but it doesn&#39;t match any times I have.
    I&#39;m uploading a better version I just got. The upper case &#34;C&#34; doesn&#39;t
    match the time new roman I have.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/53749.jpg"

  body: It looks identical to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/times-new-roman/ps/testdrive.html?s=Cadillac+Fairview&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">this</a> version at myfonts. Only difference I can see is the
    unfortunate kerning between the r and the v and they seem to have enlarged the
    dots on the i&#39;s.
