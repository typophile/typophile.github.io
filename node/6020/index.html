I think the same goes for a text face if I define a goal for it before I start. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I enjoy making fonts, all kinds of fonts and I highly suggest that a type design NEEDS to actually make both kinds at least once.

Different cuts for different sizes are what make a typeface suitable for text and display - and at that point you might say it's no longer the same typeface - you would certainly say it's no longer the same font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you look at the optical progression in ATF Garamond, you'll notice gradual curves below 12 and above 14, but an abrupt shift between 12 and 14. That's because the ATF boys saw that as the cutoff between text and display. Usually I myself would put it between 11 and 12, but considering that Garamond is small on the body, it makes sense. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if you put the 6 point ATF Garamond (enlarged) next to the 48 point ATF Garamond next to Times, and you ask laymen &quot;which two fonts are the same&quot;, you'll get them pairing up the 2nd and 3rd all the time.

And then one day I took a really good look at it (since I had come into possession of a large number of matrices for casting it) and discovered that to my new eyes, it was lovely. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I get a little tired of type police. For the past 20 years or more my attitude has been that there is no bad type, some are just better than others.

Scour the internet and look for the new Ancient Greek (sans) that Dann Carr has cut for a book titled Fragments of Parmenides, printed and published by Peter Koch.

I have seen others do the same kind of thing and the effect is striking. So perhaps this is a little off the discussion, but it IS the use of a display type for text. If you scaled that same display fce down into 12 point and set the same text the effect might be less successful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There have been many comparison studies made by scaling different type-size fonts to a common size to compare weight and stroke. I don't think anyone ever came to common understanding over it.

But there is a qualitative difference between the transparency needed in text versus display design, and this is due to the nature of the intended reading experience: deliberative, where we have time to read a handful of words and we can consciously appreciate the formal details; versus immersive, where the subconsious reading mechanism takes over, because it becomes a performance issue. Readability really only matters when a reader is pushing the limits of perception/cognition - otherwise virtually everything is pretty legible. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; it IS the use of a display type for text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only if you use a peculiar -maybe pointless- definition of &quot;text&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any<!-- raw HTML omitted --> text is &quot;text&quot;, even if it's one word. But a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->useful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> definition of &quot;text&quot; versus &quot;display&quot; entails a consideration of how humans read. It's been shown for example that when a font is too large reading slows down a lot. So to me &quot;text&quot; means a setting that crosses into the subconscious, immersive mechanism. This is where boumas start to matter, and where an x-height can be too large for example, or spacing too loose. This to me is a useful boundary to think about in the text/display discussion. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; If you scaled that same display fce down into 12 point and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; set the same text the effect might be less successful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Exactly, and not just aesthetically, but functionally. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And what does that tell you? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; not always graceful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Exactly.

		<div class="commentbody">It seems to me that generally a text type should be artistically strong enough to work for display, if it is optically scaled (big sizes 'go on a diet' for display). In other words, the letter forms will still be identifiable as the same face at both sizes. It may not be great at display, but it should look pretty darn good. The only exceptions would be designs for very small sizes like Bell Centenial or Biblion, where there are extreme distortions for the sake of legibility at a very small size.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the other way around doesn't work. There are excellent display types that won't work at all as text. There is an assymetry here.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think Hrant is right that the two different kinds of reading are different, and for extended text the typeface must be able to become transparent. If it is so mannered that it cannot become transparent it will fail as text type.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But he is wrong in ignoring that we also look at that same text type in what he calls the 'deliberative' way. We aren't always immersed. We look at the page, the subheads, the first few words more slowly. We go in and out of immersion. That's why the aesthetics and flavor of the text type are important. Ugly is a liability in a text type also, in my opinion, unless it is absolutely tiny, so the legibility trumps every other consideration.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

And yes, this means there's no such thing as a &quot;pure&quot; text face, so ugliness isn't everything - in fact I'm not proposing that a text face designer should make his font intentionally ugly! What I'm saying is that the decisions you take in a text face (because it needs to be highly immersive, something a display face does not need to be at all) automatically introduce an ugliness, so that becomes a feature, not a bug. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think an example is in order: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A common early comment about my Patria is that the dot of the &quot;i&quot; is slightly too big. My reply? Yeeeees. :-) It's intentionally &quot;too big&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->aesthetically<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because the dot is very important in readability. So in that way there's a small &quot;ugliness&quot; there, but one that only really shows up when you're looking deliberatively at the &quot;i&quot; (and usually at an unrealistically large size). However, Patria is still not ugly enough - although I think (and most people agree) that it's highly readable, it's not a &quot;real&quot; text face, the way I myself use the term. Pushing the acceptable limits of &quot;ugliness&quot; is the darkest corner of our craft, one that I hope to penetrate one day. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
