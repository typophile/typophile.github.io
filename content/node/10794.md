    the forms and visualize how you made them. Do you have a method? <BR> <BR>bj '

    I often think of the end user/project before I even start. In the case of Syncratica
    I did several Pieces that will be fused together. I often like the idea of shapes
    that can be rotated or mirrored to create something new.<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/789.jpg"

  body: ' What&#39;s interesting is how naturally these  <BR>letters come together
    in recognizalbe  <BR>ways--even though they are contrary to the way  <BR>we draw
    letters. You can imagine some  <BR>otherworldly system where these work  <BR>perfectly
    naturally. <BR> <BR>Take the K. It&#39;s the wrong way to draw a K.  <BR>However,
    you&#39;ve devised a system with the  <BR>other letters that makes that K a very
    likely  <BR>possibility. Contrast this with your &#34;Kotica&#34;  <BR>which takes
    our common method of drawing a  <BR>B, for example, and forces it into some  <BR>geometry
    where it feels forced. <BR> <BR>Am I the only one who thinks this? <BR> <BR>Good
    luck with it. '

    is simple, and serves to debunk the importance of calligraphy in type design:
    reading and writing are separate things. <BR> <BR>Or, as I&#39;ve become fond
    of saying: <BR>The hand delivers a fluidity that the eye didn&#39;t ask for. <BR>

    <BR>&#40;Now I know what verse to put on Hrant&#39;s birthday card. :D &#41; <BR>
    <BR>This is really an intriguing face -- one of the most interesting experiemnts
    I&#39;ve seen in a long time, and certainly one of the most successful at pushing
    the envelope of glyph shapes. <BR> <BR>You could almost call the &#34;W&#34; a
    &#34;doubledoubleyou&#34;. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t wait to see the full character
    set. Nice work. <BR> <BR>David '
