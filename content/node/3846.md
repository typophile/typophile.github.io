  The closest reference would be 2.4.8 on pages 43 and 44. Here Bringhurst speaks

  several in &#34;widows&#34; of single words in Bringhurst&#39;s book such as on
  pages 116, 103, and 165. In addition on page 180 of Richard Hendel&#39;s &#34;On
  Book Design&#34; I found a total of three! <BR> <BR>What seems right? '

  body: 'In my experience, the single-word last line of a paragraph is generally less
    objectionable to most typographers than the traditional widowed line at the top
    of a page. BTW, I&#39;ve encountered the terms &#34;widow&#34; and &#34;orphan&#34;
    used inconsistently when speaking of these different situations: a short line
    alone at the top a page, a single beginning line at the bottom of a page, and
    a short line at the end of a paragraph. But all deserve a typographer&#39;s attention.
    <BR> <BR>Actually, Bringhurst does address your question directly in &sect;2.4.2:
    <BR> <BR><I>Avoid leaving the stub-end of a hyphenated word, or any word shorter
    than four letters, as the last line of a paragraph.</I> <BR> <BR>But he doesn&#39;t
    offer any additional explication. <BR> <BR>What constitutes an unacceptably short
    last line of a paragraph is indeed often a matter of style. I know book designers
    with varying degrees of tolerance. Some designers I know will <I>never</I> accept
    a single word as the last line of a paragraph, but I think this is an impractical
    stance.  <BR> <BR>In my opinion, it depends upon the length of the final word,
    the line-length of the text, and the size of the indent. I will tolerate a single
    word, but I never accept a single-word last line which is shorter than the paragraph
    indent and usually prefer the word to be at least double the length of the indent.
    When possible, I prefer to see the last line of the paragraph be at least 20%
    of the line length. A shorter line length can accommodate a shorter last line.
    But that&#39;s a loose rule and the &#40;trained&#41; eye is the best judge. <BR>
    <BR>I will accept a single word because often the alternative is less desireable
    -- overly loose lines to push a word or overly tight ones to take it up. I&#39;d
    rather see a single-word last line than bad word-spacing &#40;or, heaven forbid,
    letter-spacing&#41;. <BR> <BR>-- K.'
