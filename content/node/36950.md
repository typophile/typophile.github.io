  body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nA great deal of Adidas campaigns (and other shoemakers)
    use custom proprietary type designs that are not available for license for you
    and me. I'm not sure if your sample graphic falls into this category but here
    are some fonts that I think that look close to it:\r\n\r\nThis looks like a rounded
    version of FB Stainless.\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Stainless\r\n\r\nBut
    you can also have a look at Neo San and Neo Tech.\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=415092&grab_id=0&page_id=3336&query=neo%20sans&SCOPE=Fonts\r\n\r\n\r\nMike
