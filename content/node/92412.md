  containing the word RAINDAUGHTER. Afaik some kind of (professional) weaving loom
  weaved it onto that cloth. I'm trying to get more characters, but for now that's
  all I have.\r\n\r\nEspecially the A with the rounded top seems to be rarely found
  in fonts (at least those that I found ...).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and best regards\r\nSoeren\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/raindaughter_font3_upload_4879.jpg]"

    and\u2014in some cases\u2014they are, but modified enough to avoid copyright infringement
    issues. \r\n\r\nIn this instance, the latter may be the case. The unmirrored serif
    on the bottom of the N is an oddity, the T and the E are somewhat out of place,
    and the A may well be an rotated U with a crossbar added."
