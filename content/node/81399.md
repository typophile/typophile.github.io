  I could not find a \"Favourite Font\" topic anywhere.  \r\nNow this could be in
  part with my inability to search effectively, but regardless we shall continue forward.\r\n\r\nI
  realize that plenty of you who call this forum your home, are designers and typographers,
  and have see your fair share of typefaces through the years.  And through the years,
  there is a very good change that you have grown a liking towards certain fonts.\r\n\r\nSo
  what is your current <em>favourite</em> serif font/s for using when writing a paper/novel/report/etc?\r\n"

  body: "@BrettR:\r\n\r\nOne of the things I've learned about typography is that there
    are many fonts for many contexts. And the first step toward good font selection
    is the ability to categorize both contexts and fonts. \r\n\r\nIf I were looking
    for an answer to this sort of question, I would limit the inquiry to a specific
    class of fonts (e.g., contemporary humanist sans or something that narrows the
    thousands of possibilities). Or maybe you could start with the context, like \"What's
    your favorite font for menus at Mexican restaurants.\"\r\n\r\nI think for most
    designers, a font is just not that interesting without knowing the context or
    classification.\r\n\r\nA good way to see what people are the sales charts at myfonts.com.
    Right now, the hottest new font on myfonts is probably \"Gibson\". It just came
    out and it costs $48 for the complete 8-weight family. All its weights look usable
    (which is not always the case)."

    -- just a grad student/scientist with a keen interest in the type I look at not
    looking like crap...and boy a lot of it does!\r\n\r\nI'm befuddled by the people
    who are advocating monospaced faces for writing. I use monospaced faces for editing
    code, as spacing can be very important in some languages (Python, matrices in
    MATLAB), and you can use appropriate spacing to make the code easier to read and
    understand (I often make all the entries in vectors that have a one-to-one correspondence
    line up, for example). When writing documents with lots of text, however, I like
    to look at something proportionally spaced as I find it is much easier to read
    the text when revising my document. For example, I use Verdana in the text editor
    I use with LaTeX as a compromise -- while other faces may look prettier on the
    screen when editing, Verdana is at least fairly decent, and has very good distinction
    within Il|1 and O0o.\r\n\r\nFor general-purpose documents (progress reports, research
    summaries, homework assignments, etc.) I generally set the document in Minion,
    mostly because it is the only font (other than Computer Modern) for which I have
    gotten reasonably full support for equations working in LaTeX, but also because
    I think it looks nice without being over-the-top. (And in some ways its math support
    [using MinionPro.sty] is actually better because it supports upright and/or bold
    lowercase greek letters, which Computer Modern does not -- then I can adhere to
    ISO recommendations regarding \u03C0 being upright when used as a physical constant,
    and my own preferred convention of unit vectors such as <strong>\u03D5</strong>-hat,
    <strong>\u03B8</strong>-hat and <strong>\u03B6</strong>-hat being upright bold
    and ordinary vectors such as <strong><em>\u03C9</em></strong> being bold italic...but
    that was probably more detail than you wanted in this thread!)"

    I use monospaced faces for editing code\r\n\r\nI think your view is shared by
    most people. Monospaced fonts are used for coding or occasionally for their aesthetic
    effect, in display. Courier is also required for screen plays, and a few other
    places. \r\n\r\nBut in general most people feel that proportional spacing is more
    readable, and I think they're right. \r\n\r\nMinion is a great workhorse font,
    and I admire its great craftsmanship. But for me personally, I think it is a little
    too compressed for maximum reading comfort, and also the punctuation is kerned
    too tightly. \r\n\r\nI recently went through the exercise of setting a few pages
    of the same text in Minion, and then in Williams Caslon. Though Williams Caslon
    is a bit wider and more loosely set, used slightly smaller, it ended up with the
    same material in the same space, but being, to my eyes, a bit more comfortable
    to read. Of course, I am prejudiced as the designer of Williams Caslon, but there
    is a more general point here, which is that using a very compact face, such as
    Times New Roman or Minion is not necessary the best way to fit a lot of words
    on a page. "
