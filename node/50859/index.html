  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey guys, 
It's been awhile since I've created a logo, and have been stuck on this one for my church. The logo on the left is our current logo which I did around 5 or 6 years ago. The 2 on the right are a couple of possibilities that I'm working on. 

The goal of the logo is to signify a bit of a fresh start, and attempt to make the logo / church look a little more approachable and friendly. 

Is it working? Too cliché? Any suggestions?

Thanks!
Jesse</div>

No... it's not a map Sharon, but I can see how it looks like one now. It's an attempt at mixing a lake / mountain landscape image with a person celebrating. I suppose that it still needs some work though :)

		<div class="commentbody">Rounded couple reminds me of olympics. Right most column remind me of a swimmer. I wouldn't relate this logo with church even though it's a very nice and eye pleasing logo. It's just not the right one to me.

Approachable? Friendly? How about open hands? Maybe with a clover it's in nature surroundings. Or a leaf or something. But yes. It won't be logo evolution. More like a revolution.

Anyway. To me it doesn't resemble anything to what it represents. Even worse. It looks like it's something completely different.

		<div class="commentbody">I disagree with litera. It doesn't have to resemble what it represents at all. I saw the landscape/person before I read the post too. Even though it didn't say "churh" to me right away, once I found out that the logo was for a church, I saw a cross and a dove (and I'm not religious, so I don't tend to notice things like that often).

I think it's a fresh departure from the "traditional" church "logos."</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think this is a nice redesign. I agree that the rightward movement of the figure in the right column is more pleasing, though you do complicate the reading of it as the features are inverted from how they appear in the name. Any chance you could rename the place "Mountlake"? ;-)

The typefaces may be a touch sterile but even so I think you have the welcoming mood you're looking for.

The rounded horizontal rectangle called to my mind a TV screen, but that was sixth- or seventh-impression.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I feel that the original midle column was the one that struck me the most.  Blame the directionality on my laft-handedness but I felt that the action pointed towards the right (more dynamic or so I'm told) is better, but the question is, which is more important for a 'worship centre', movement and advancing, or meditation and slowing down?  I feel strong arguments could be made for both, but you have to admit it's far less common to see a left-leaning logo so it might stand out in the mind better.

I never understood the whole 'worship centre' thing.  In my experience it differs from a church because there isn't 'crowd surfing' or 'sprinting up and down the aisles' in church.  Oh that was one scary experience having to dodge sprinters just to get a seat.

I am somewhat turned off by the latest logo because to me, I see a tree, a flame and then the first combination that pops into my head is: Natural Gas / Environmental

Also, I feel that the type choice (please don't lynch me) in the first one will last longer than in the latest one.  I feel that the latest one has a shorter lifespan and will feel 'dated' longer.

I hope you will continue to develop the original middle column idea and see where that leads you as you explore other options too.</div>

The kid the with ladder looks too complicated - what is he holding? and in b/w, it looks like he's climbing to clean some specs off the wall. Good idea, but not the most practical for this use, in my opinion at least.

I think it's kind of got that 50's googie feel to it to (a good thing, it's casual and informal).

What I do wonder though, is if you are using 4 elements to construct the cross, what do the four stand for?  I recall seeing this logo from the Christian Missionary Alliance, where each element represents one of their core values as a denomination.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/emblem30_5816.png]

I don't want to assume your Worship Centre is of pentecostal affiliation, but is there a way that your design could (even if not in a way as obvious as the CMA) reference the number of key points or a significant number just to be consistent.

Four makes me think of the four corners of the earth, that's the first thing that pops into my head, and while looking at your logo, I do think that (I know I'm weird eh?)

Hope this provides some insight and some feedback, keep up the great work!</div>

Innovati, you're correct to think of the 'four corners' analogy here, that was my thinking as well when designing the logo. Also that the four corners come together to form the church, as represented by the cross. 

At first I didn't want to use a cross in the logo because it could be a bit cliché. Now though, we've decided that its a perfectly good method of representing the church, and have figured out a way to 'freshen up' the image. 

I continued sketching this idea out, and here is the progress...

		<div class="commentbody">agreed.  All logos should work in 1 colour, and the gradient ones don't allow for that.  Sure the logo can be spiced up to suit the occasion, but I feel that as a mark the previous incarnation with the separation lines worked better.

I like the concept, and to address your fear of the cliché, I don't think in this case the cross is being used out-of-context or in a clicé way.

The cross will always remain relevant, but where it most cliché is when designers attempt to integrate it into a place where it doesn't belong, at any cost. We've all seen crosses replace 't's in words that don't need it, or incredibly cross-suggestive layouts where it doesn't help the content.

What you've done, create a cross through the joining of independent elements, or creating a cross-shaped-hole inbetween the rectangles so me is a first, you've surely found a new way to show the same image.  Far from cliché in my eyes.

I think the proportions could use a slight amount of tweaking, but I have nothing to suggest other than the feeling that it's not 100% done yet (sorry I can't be of more help)

Keep working on it, I'll stick around to give my 2¢ as long as it's helpful!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ladder idea: very nicely done, but not for this "client" IMO. Hands: no. I liked the leaf direction. But I have to say I really like the overlapping gradients. I prefer the ones without the white cross in the center, where it's more subtle. I could see that being very cool as signage, with overlappying pieces of amber or colored glass. Obviously the cross is central to the church, and this presents it in a unique way. FWIW, I'm in the buckle of the bible belt, and have seen a lot of church-related design.</div>

I think the leaf/flame works best, once you move away from gas companies; I also like the last one: the coming together to form a cross seems like a church-y thing to go with. And the moving man/mountain-lake one works as well, I think.

The ladder one looks like a movie company (I can't imagine why…); it just doesn't say "church" in my opinion; the one with the hands is WAY too obvious, so I'd discard it.

Overall, I think you've done a great job! Good stuff!</div>

It's amazing what a day or two will do to change your perspective on a logo. I was loving the hands / dove thing when working on it, but now think it looks ridiculous. 

Here's my latest concept. Hopefully I'll still like it in a couple of days from now :)

A number of the logo concepts have potential. It seems like a direction is evolving for this logo project, so I will wait to comment until your next round of refinements.

Has Lakemount Worship Center seen, or commented, on any of the concepts? If so, what has their feedback been so far.

Nice work. It is has been enjoyable to watch the process so far.

		<div class="commentbody">The version with the offset outline seems a little less current. But, that could be because I'm old and have used that style before in the last 10 years. :^P I like them both though. Age isn't a reason to avoid using a style.

Edit: I'm waffling. I think I do prefer the version without the outline because it implies a little more elegance. But, on the other hand I could equally say I prefer the other version because the outline and the offset implies a level of casual and openness.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your feedback... I'm sort of waffling on the outline direction as well. Part of me likes it, and part of me doesn't. It might just come down to how it's actually used. 

Can I shift gears for a bit and ask for some advice on the type itself? Is Omnes working? Do any other typefaces come to mind that might work better?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Outline version: no, no, no. Visually the hand symbol is stronger and clearer in the original form. The offset outline is trendy, but will date quickly. It also looks plugged up, and causes you to lose the nice space in between the fingers. Also, I preferred your original rendering of the hand. I don't see any way it would look like a claw. The way the fingers tapered in the original version looked more like feathers, I think you've lost some of the elegance in the new version.

I think Omnes is a perfect compliment to the symbol, with the tapered endings. Nice job.

I think you've gone past the solution in this latest version...

Type works very well with the symbol.
I like the non-outlined version better (as I said already once before).
