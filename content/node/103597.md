  body: "Perhaps someone else recognizes an exact match.\r\nThis is in a style called
    \"Tuscan\" which includes a large number of fonts with variations in the split
    ends shown in your sample. The style often includes the spurs sticking out at
    mid height. Your sample is a logo so it could be modified from its source. \r\nIf
    \ you would be satisfied with something similar a good place to check for commercial
    fonts is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Atuscan/fonts/\">MyFonts
    with tag Tuscan</a>. Identifont has some <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/list?2+tuscan+22+G7I+1+K0X+1+99E+2+GI3+4+JV6+5+EOB+11+324M+12+3284+14+JVU+14+C4Y+15+FWW+15+JV4+16+JVP+16+JV0+18+C4X+20+JVN+20+K2T+21+JVC+28+JVQ+29+M7R+32+L8J+35+2GCK+36+2A76+37\">Tuscan
    fonts not shown at MyFonts</a>.\r\nLetterhead fonts has a <a href=\"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/styles/western.php\">Western
    category</a> which includes Tuscan fonts.\r\nFor free fonts, of varying provenance
    and credibility, you could check  <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=106\">Dafont
    category Western</a> which includes Tuscan fonts.\r\nDon"
