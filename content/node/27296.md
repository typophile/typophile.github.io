  to dinner one night and which has been hanging around the apartment ever since.
  It's a not particularly traditional being a 'tetra-pak' container, but nonetheless
  with its clean and minimal design looks very elegant.\r\n\r\nThe type used for \"TATEYAMA\"
  & TATEYAMA BREWING CO.\" looks as though it could be custom lettering?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nGrant
  Dunlop\r\n\r\nPS The sake in the container was quite good!"
