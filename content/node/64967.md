body: "Greetings,\r\n\r\nHaving had zero response from Quark after 24 hours, I thought
  I might try here in case someone knows about this. \r\n\r\nI am designing a scholarly
  history right now, 256 pages, with about 400 endnotes. I'm running Quark 8.1 on
  a Mac, bringing in a manuscript written in Word (97, I think?) on a Sony laptop
  running Windows XP.\r\n\r\nWhen I bring in the document, all of the superscripts
  change from the arabic numerals in the manuscript, to lower-case roman numerals!
  No variation of \"use existing style\" or \"use new style\" seems to change this.
  I asked the author to uncheck \"fast save\" since I remember this having been an
  issue in jobs from many years ago, but she looked at her tools settings and it was
  already unchecked.\r\n\r\nAnybody know what setting I need to change? I spent a
  long time looking through the Quark user manual and in their knowledge base (and
  also checked here) but couldn't turn up anything. Help!\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nBruce\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Bruce -- Good to see you; it's been a while. Some random thoughts: \r\n\r\nSounds
    like an encoding issue to me. Find out how the author has been entering the superscripts.
    What font is used on the author end? What font are you using on the design side?
    \r\n\r\nAre the resulting roman numerals full-size baseline characters, or superscripted?\r\n\r\nTry
    selecting a bit of copy and use File > Save Text . . . to get the text back out
    and inspect it in a text editor. You might try saving in XPress Tags format to
    see if there are mysterious features being applied to the superscripts in question.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck. "

  body: "Hi Kent and everyone,\r\n\r\nYes, it's been ages since I came by. I'll hope
    to be around more often in the future. \r\n\r\nProblem resolved: I paid my $39
    to get this fixed, and discovered that it is \"a known issue\" with Quark (not
    sure if all version numbers, but certainly 8.1) and Microsoft Word. In the end
    the very nice person at Quark Tech Support had me email her the manuscript doc
    and she made the changes for us, because my collaborator/author was not able to
    do this workaround on her own machine. I'm going to spell it out here in case
    anyone does a search for this problem in the future.\r\n\r\nIn Word, follow this
    path: INSERT > REFERENCE > FOOTNOTES. At that point there's a pop-up dialogue
    labeled CONVERT (or the equivalent). There are supposed to be three choices. However,
    the author's machine had only the top choice active/black and had its radio button
    already pressed, with no chance for us to deselect it. As I recall this top choice
    was \"Footnotes to Endnotes.\" The other two choices were \"Endnotes to Footnotes\"
    and something else that I don;t remember (and her computer is now gone). In our
    situation both of these other choices were grayed out and inaccessible. Hence
    the request from the tech person that I email her the file. \r\n\r\nTo the best
    of my understanding, she opened the file on her own computer with her copy of
    Word, switched the selection to \"Endnotes to Footnotes,\" and apparently that
    did it. When I imported the new file, all of the superscripts were in arabic numerals.\r\n\r\nBruce"

    format for footnotes is arabic. The default format for endnotes is roman. Converting
    existing notes <em>will</em> change the active numbering mode, but ... it's somewhat
    easier to only change the number format:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/notes_5415.PNG]\r\n\r\nI
    didn't react to the original question because, well, isn't this an option in Quark?
