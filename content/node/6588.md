body: 'Hi Centaur fans, <BR> <BR>   I just got my copy of &#34;An Account of the Making
  of the Oxford Lectern Bible&#34;, and am very much enjoying it. <BR> <BR>   Some
  questions: <BR> <BR>1. Does anyone still own the copyright on this pamphlet, or
  has it passed into the public domain? If the latter, I&#39;m very willing to make
  scans available. <BR> <BR>2. Even if I don&#39;t post full scans, do people want
  to see details? I can also post a scan of the Oxford Lectern Bible page reproduced
  in Stanley Morison&#39;s <i>The Typographic Book</i>. <BR> <BR>3. The font used
  to set the Oxford Lectern Bible is in fact 18-point &#34;Bible Centaur&#34;. This
  font is an adaptation of the original Centaur, with some modifications: ascenders
  and descenders are shortened; thirteen lowercase letters are redrawn, mostly to
  make them more condensed &#40;Rogers doesn&#39;t give the full list, but he identifies
  bdfgkljonpqu and maybe y, to which I&#39;d add e and t, which is of course 14 or
  15&#41;; and the Centaur numbers are replaced with Plantin Light OSF. The quirkiness
  factor has definitely gone down; in addition to the numbers, the tail of the &#39;j&#39;
  is now solidly in the classical Aldine tradition. <BR> <BR>4. If I&#39;m going to
  work on this font, my goal would probably be an optically scaled series containing
  both Centaur and Bible Centaur, as well as the large chapter initial caps. How much
  interest do Typophiles think there would be in such a thing? <BR> <BR>5. I&#39;m
  also trying to understand the ethics of releasing and naming revivals, and want
  to make sure to do everything right. My gut feeling is that the name &#34;Bible
  Centaur&#34;, while very appealing for its historical accuracy, cuts too close to
  Agfa Monotype&#39;s valid trademark. Other choices include &#34;Rogers&#34; &#40;by
  which name a version of Centaur was briefly sold by Commercial Controls for use
  on the Justowriter&#41;, or &#34;Oxford Lectern Bible&#34;. Of course, for the last,
  I&#39;d definitely want to work with the people at Oxford University Press. <BR>
  <BR>6. Does anyone know of a library or other collection that has the Oxford Lectern
  Bible and would be open to high-resolution scanning? I see the Donohue Rare Book
  Room at University of San Francisco has a copy, and they&#39;re reasonably close
  by. <BR> <BR>This font has captured my heart in a way that few others have. Originally,
  I was planning on working on ATF Cloister, but now after some study I feel that
  Centaur &#40;upon which Cloister was based after Rogers rebuffed ATF&#39;s effort
  to buy rights&#41; is superior in every respect.'

    <BR>A good optically-scaled Centaur? Are you kidding?! <BR>Not even Monotype did
    a really great job scaling it - I think they only had four masters. <BR> <BR>But

  body: Reinterpreting Centaur at different sizes I think is basically redoing Jenson,
    because Centaur is an interpretation of Jenson.  <BR> <BR>Since Abobe Jenson Pro
    of Robert Slimbach is a very impressive optically scaled version of Jenson, if
    I were you I would want to have at least one very strong idea on what I want to
    do differently from Slimbach before starting. Incidentally, Jenson Pro includes
    a &#39;light&#39; version, optically scaled, which is closer to Centaur than the
    regular version.

    be able to find the original. What about access to the actual metal type? You
    could make letterpress prints and work from those. The advantage is you could
    under-ink and under-impress it to get closer to the actual &#34;outlines&#34;.

    know what Raph&#39;s is, but all I&#39;m saying is that you are going to have
    to do some variation to take into account digital &amp; offset printing vs metal
    and letter press. And that means you are going to have to change things.  <BR>
    <BR>If you change things, then I think it is wise to look at all the other important
    interpretations of Jenson, including Slimbach&#39;s, and be very clear about what
    you want to do differently before you start. I am not saying that a person has
    to stick to his original idea. But if a person starts a reinterpretation without
    as clear idea, I think the chances of coming up with something fresh and good
    are greatly diminished.'

    <BR>Digital Centaur is little used because it is too light at small sizes. If

    and others have faced. If I were going to try myself &#40;which I&#39;m not&#41;

    alternate glyphs and other goodies, and is overall very useful. <BR> <BR>That
    said, Centaur and Jenson are by no means the same font. I&#39;ll let Bruce Rogers
    speak to that, starting with his reaction to seeing the type in Jenson&#39;s 1470
    <i>Eusebius:</i> <BR> <BR><i>This time I had fugitive [underdeveloped] prints
    enlarged to about five times original size [and] was at once struck by the pen-like
    characteristics of the lower-case letters; so with a flat pen cut to the width
    of the heavier lines, I wrote over the photographic print as rapidly as I could,
    thus preserving the proportions, at least, of Jenson&#39;s own characters. ...
    and these, with capitals drawn with a pointed pen over photographs of the original,
    served as models for the first cutting of the Centaur type.</i> -- American Proprietary
    Typefaces, p. 50 <BR> <BR>And, to me, that is the essence of the difference between
    Jenson and Centaur. The letters of the latter are, at heart, drawn by pen. It
    is the stroke, not the outline, which defines the shape of the letter. To me,
    the capitals of the 60pt metal Centaur possess a calligraphic refinement more
    akin to Michelangelo or Trajan than any of the other Jenson revivals. <BR> <BR>Of
    course I have several reproductions of Jenson&#39;s work, and may well do a pilgrimage
    to a museum to view an original. <BR> <BR>John wrote: <BR> <BR><i>As Hrant notes,

    I had a wierd idea of placing the scanner face-down on the surface of the book,

    a new member of typophile. The reason for me to finally enter was the discussion
    of Centaur typeface. Yet, some time has passed ;-) (it is dated 2004) \r\n\r\nThank
    you Raph for the impressive good scans of the Bible. How did you get them? Great
    material!\r\n\r\nI wanted to add that a beautiful Centaur (I believe) was done
    and hopefully still exists during the \u201CValdonega Aesthetic Line\u201D project
    brought to live in the 90\u2019s by the Stamperia Valdonega, Verona or better
    to say Martino Mardersteig son of the great printer Giovanni Mardersteig. We did
    (I was so happy to join this project those days) a version in several sizes (8,
    12, 16) very very close to hotmetal Montotype version. I later on added some characters
    to achieve the first handprinted version (1913/14). I think the face is still
    available there if you want to print from it at the Stamperia because the type
    will not be available on the fontmarket and I think Mardersteig had his good reasons
    for so much work was needed. \r\n\r\nI think he will allow me to show something
    for I done the digitalisation myself and I am quite proud of it, I have to admit.
    We used a very special design technique. I added also a text that explained a
    bit. I was very young yet at those times and I have to excuse for my very bad
    and somewhat striking English. But maybe it could be interesting to add something
    to current discussions if there are any now.\r\n\r\nLast word to Jenson Adobe.
    I do believe Centaur in the original version ist more close to Jensons real style
    than the Adobe font which is to my eyes too round too soft and some letters aren\u2019t
    very nice especiall \u2018g\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019. Although I do admire the
    abstract and nice modern serif treatment in enlargement.\r\n\r\nThanks so far\r\nhope
    someone will talk to me\r\n\r\nPS couldn\u2019t attach the text for he doesn\u2019t
    allow me pdf. Or is there a way?\r\n\r\nStefan[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letters_6226.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Centaur_VAL_hotmetal_5944.jpg]"
