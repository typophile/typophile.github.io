    professional did it. However, I can't find any slab serif to match the combination
    of the 'a', 'E', \"K\", and 'W', which are all key letters I use for my Serif
    Font ID Guide. I've searched both the new and old Big Yellow FontBooks, to no
    avail either.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Using Erik's comment I hunted through the samples in 'Dutch Type' by Jan
    Middendorp. Unfortunately, typeface samples in that otherwise great book are of
    widely varying usefulness and completeness. The only typeface I saw that I thought
    had something of the look of the sample was Just van Rossum's 'Gak Serif', which
    was a custom job for GAK, the Dutch government insurance agency. However, the
    sample has too few letters to see more than the similarity in the serifs for the
    lower case. I couldn't find any samples of it online either. Gak serif is wider
    than the Delta Whiskey lettering, but we know how easily width can be adjusted.
    I'm not saying Gak Serif is the answer, but possibly it is a van Rossum design
    ('shared DNA' rationale used in the Gulliver thread). It seems unlikely to me
    that Delta Whiskey would have custom type designed for them, so I really doubt
    my own answer, but wanted to say what I found from searching that book of Dutch
    Type. One thing that was apparent was there seem to be relatively few Dutch slab
    serif designs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    by [[John Hudson]] and [[W Ross Mills|W. Ross Mills]] of [[Tiro Typeworks]], and
    [[Geraldine Wade]] of [[Monotype Typography]]. Sylfaen is a Welsh word meaning
    \"foundation\"; an apt name since the font stemmed from research into the typographic
    requirements of many different scripts and languages.\r\n\r\nThis version of Sylfaen
    supports the WGL4.0 character set, for Pan-European language coverage. In addition
    to [[Latin]], [[Greek]] and [[Cyrillic]] letterforms, the font contains the characters
    necessary for support of the [[Armenian]] and [[Georgian]] languages."
