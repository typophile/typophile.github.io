  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all, I'm new here, so I'm sorry if this isn't the kind of thing to be posting.

I work doing layout for a small town 'newspaper' (more of a newsletter really), and have recently seen the following course offered near-by:

http://www.skillpath.com/seminfo.html/st/BROCH

I'm interested in attending it with another of the girls from work as I haven't had much to do with design since a couple of basic courses in Uni years ago, and the other lady hasn't done anything at all. The boss agreed it would be good, but then the next boss up said that they didn't like SkillPath as the seminars are not hands-on enough. Personally I think a 2 day design course such as this one doesn't need to be 'hands-on' as such. It's more of a beginners course that should cover the basics and teach the theory behind design, rather than how to physically create design (which is what I think they mean by hands on).

The boss has asked me to put together a few reasons in dot-point as to why this course will be of value to myself and my work mate. The problem is that while I know a little about design I don't know enough to be able to convince someone who knows nothing that a knowledge of design is needed. I get the feeling that, like most people who are not familiar with design concepts and who have Publisher at home, they don't really see the value in knowledge about approriate techniques.

Any advice would be great, I'm sorry for the long rambling explanation, I will try to keep any future posts short!

		<div class="commentbody">I followed the link you posted, and it didn't do much for me. It instantly reminded of "How to burn off 20 pounds of ugly fat in just 5 days." -- In other words, a waste of money.

The phrase "tips the pros use" is one tip-off. If it were a matter of "tips," we'd all be pros. Rich, too. Or the repeated phrase "keep your readers riveted to the page." You keep your readers riveted to the page by the copy, not the design. Design can help organize material for a clearer presentation, but as for riveting, no, you have to go to the shipyard.

More seriously, If your newspaper/newsletter company is a smallish company, I can well understand the boss not wanting to pay for such a course, hands-on or not. If you are going to be with the company a number of years, they might be willing to help defray the cost of some design education, but realistically, unless you are in the advertising department (and it is more of a newspaper than a newsletter), there isn't much in it for them.

None of which should stop you from learning, at first through books, and later, if the interest is there, through formal training if you want. Depends on what you want. I've always believed that school gets you your first job; how you do in that first job gets you your second job. But that's just jobs; education is a different matter.

A good 'design' seminar that you should drag your boss to is one of the Ed Tufte seminars that he does annually around the country. A really great 'aha!' one-day course for those in business that just haven't figure it out yet.

		<div class="commentbody">In other words in 6 hours you will be a productive graphic designer. I went to one of their seminars once. For the $200 I heard a lot of misinformation. The weakest part of the course is the typography information. Go to the library and read a few good books so that you can diferentiate between good and bad design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, thank you both for your comments.

I looked up the Ed Tufte seminars, unfortunately though, I don't think the company would be keen to send me to the States for a course.

The company I work for is a big one and they don’t have any issues with spending the money to send us on a course, they just don’t think this one is any good. I agree with you Charles that it is a very commercial-looking course; however I think there might be some information worth listening to in there. I’m going to be away from work for 5 weeks visiting America (so maybe I could catch an Ed Tufte course after all… ) and my work mate will be taking over doing the “Gibber”. Here’s a copy of the Gibber from last year, before I took over the job:

http://www.woomera.com.au/community/gibber_gabber/2006/10_Nov_06.pdf

My friend was doing the Gibbers back then and she did a great job, especially since she had no formal training at any level, and I believe the lady filling in for me will be the same. You’ll probably notice a few mistakes in there that are obvious if you know what you’re looking for and it’s those sort of things that I’m hoping this course will help us with. As I said it’s the basic stuff we’re hoping to get from the course.

Which books would you recommend? I did a super basic desktop design course when I went to Uni in 2002 I think, but it was a basic course, mandatory for all of the multi-media students (I was keen on computer animation back in those days) but I enjoyed it and I do love putting the Gibber together and find design interesting. 

If your curious here is one of my most recent editions (still with a lot of the same basic flaws, but I think I’ve been able to use some of what I remember from Uni to bring the look up a bit).

http://www.woomera.com.au/community/gibber_gabber/2007/31_Aug_07.pdf

Any and all advice on how to improve the Gibber are more than welcome too!

Thanks again,

Amber</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, Amber,

Here are some books you may want to check out:

On newspaper design:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Contemporary-Newspaper-Design-Typography-Newsprint/dp/0972424032/ref=sr_1_1/104-0871536-9538369?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189571650&sr=1-1"><em>Contemporary Newspaper Design</em></a>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Editing-Design-Designers-Directors-Editors/dp/1581153023/ref=sr_1_2/104-0871536-9538369?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189572467&sr=1-2"><em>Editing by Design</em></a> (This is a 2003 edition... There are also older editions, as far back as 1974's, going for very little money.)

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0275924645/ref=s9_asin_title_3/104-0871536-9538369?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=14857BGWBCQTJH2J0GCZ&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=288448401&pf_rd_i=507846"><em>Elements of Newspaper Design</em></a> (Don't know this one... Just found it on Amazon.)

On grids:

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Breaking-Grid-Graphic-Workshop/dp/1592531253/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-0871536-9538369?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189570580&sr=1-1"><em>Making and Breaking the Grid</em></a>

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grids-Structure-Graphic-Andre-Jute/dp/0823065480/ref=sr_1_9/104-0871536-9538369?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189570283&sr=1-9"><em>Grids: The Structure of Graphic Design</em></a> (a little pricey on the U.S. Amazon, I admit -- maybe it's out of print)

As to your own work, I like the new logo and the use of a serif face for the body text. However, beware of setting body copy across the entire width of a page... The usual advice given is that a column of text becomes uncomfortable to read if you go beyond 10-12 words per line.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Darrel. Buy Tufte's books. You will probably learn more from starting with a couple of books and then do a course. That way you will know a bit more of what to look for/which sort of course would be best for you.

You should get Robert Bringhurst's book "Elements of typographic styles". Though no beginners book it is a great source for looking up information and by many considered somewhat of a bible for typography.

One book great to start with would be "stop stealing sheep" by Erik Spiekerman. It will get you started.
