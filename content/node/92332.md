body: "I am developing a font with ligatures and small caps. I have the Liga and Smcp
  features working nicely by themselves. But while testing, if I convert a word that
  contains a ligature to small caps, the ligature remains and the rest of the glyphs
  are converted.\r\n\r\nHow do I tell the Smcp feature to convert the ligatures back
  to their original glyphs and then to small caps?\r\n\r\nI could turn the ligature
  feature off in my design app before I convert to small caps but I would rather see
  this work automatically. I've see fonts that do this but I am lost trying to figure
  it out.\r\n"
