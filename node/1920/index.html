<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Well, they don't really. The mention of Garamond is frequent (to put it mildly) but there isn't a lot of actual endorsement. <br> <br>Three threads contained actual endorsements of particular Garamonds: <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/11541.html>20 Typefaces to start a designer's career</a> <br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6318.html>If you could only use 5 typefaces</a> <br>and the even more stringent <br><a href=http://>Only One Typeface</a> <br> <br>The results: <br> <br>Stempel Garamond - 3 endorsements <br>Adobe Gramond - 3 endorsements, 1 mention <br>Garamond - 2 <br>Garamond Pro OTF - 1 <br> <br>And that includes a single person endorsing both Adobe and Stempel. <br> <br>Now this is an afternoon of combing threads (about 20 or so out of 148 of them), so it looks like I'm at the point of diminishing return. <br> <br>I'd like to ask some specific questions and see if we can't get a better measure. <br> <br>Which Garamond <br>a. Would you buy for your own type library? <br>b. Would you set a book or long text in? <br>c. Would you set at display size? <br> <br>Be specific. Let 'er rip. I'll tally the results in a few days. <br> <br>Jon</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>a. Sabon Next. <br>b. Sabon Next. <br>c. Sabon Next. <br> <br>An alternate choice for the display size would be 1530 Garamond, but it isn't for sale at the moment. <br> <br>Apparently Adobe may yet release Robert Slimbach's magnum opus Garamond revival, which has been in the works for more than ten years. <br> <br>For me, one of the principal criterion in selecting a Garamond would be the italic. I'd want an italic based on Garamond's not Granjon's. That said, I'm currently reading a book set in Linotype Granjon, and rather like it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was surprised that nobody had mentioned Sabon, Monotype Garamond or Berthold Garamond. <br> <br>I'm not surprised that Stempel Garamond rated highly, but I have to say that I'm not overly fond of it. I think it is just too "chiseled" for my taste as to what I want as a book face. There are even more chiseled looking faces that I like plenty, but not for book text. <br> <br>I would also note that as a typeface design, Adobe Garamond Pro (OpenType) is essentially the same design as Adobe Garamond. <br> <br>Normally I can't comment on unannounced projects, but Rob's Garamond revival is one that we have actually previewed in public. I will say that it is his top priority major project. I can't comment on a timeline, but it's getting plenty of attention and I don't expect it to end up on the back burner again. <br> <br>a) Since I always have all Adobe typefaces, the one I'd go out and buy would be Sabon Next. <br> <br>b & c) Can't answer at this time. Would have to do a more careful evaluation of Sabon Next, and will soon be competing with our new project. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't think Sabon Next is a better choice than AGaramond. It's very contrasty and hard on the eyes. The Display version is just a bit too light at 11 point, but the Regular is way too dark. AGaramond seems just right, at least on my particular laser printer, but you have to use it at one-half point larger size to match Sabon Next.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Oh I should say that in my brief survey, I limited myself to mentions of types <i>named</i> Garamond, not all Garamond/esque(?) types. <br> <br>I think that it's hugely useful to list Sabon Next, and I'm sure others might qualify as Garamonds. For the purposes of the survey, if you do include typfaces that aren't named Garamond, please be specific. <br> <br>Any endorsements of metal Garamonds? <br> <br>Jon</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think you have to do it based on the design at least as much as the name. Sabon qualifies more than many typefaces that are merely named Garamond. For example, ITC Garamond's relationship to the original seems barely more than nominal. <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>I don't think Sabon Next is a better choice than AGaramond. It's very contrasty and hard on the eyes. The Display version is just a bit too light at 11 point, but the Regular is way too dark.</i> <br> <br>Well, you shouldn't be using the display version at 11pt anyway, but if the regular seems too dark this may simply be the way your printer handles it. In print, i.e. offset printed at 2400 or 3600 dpi, the regular is not too dark at all; in fact it can be a little light. I still think it is the best Garamond revival. Of course, I have a soft spot for <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/1530-garamond/>1530 Garamond</a>, but it is probably too authentic for daily use.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Goudy "Garamont" soon to be available at Lanston. Many reasons to look at it. The face is ready for release now. <br> <br>Some think it has too much Goudy in it.

<div class=commentbody>I found strange to decide that a particularly weight of a particularly typeface is too light or too dark after tests on a particular laser printer. <br> <br>For example: to my experience, Apple laser printers give very bold type when HP laser printer give the reverse. <br> <br>And, specially, when the final output is offset litho, on a particular paper, what you've got on a laser printer is irrelevant at all. <br> <br>If I comeback to Garamond question, I can say that Adobe Garamond was my prefered Garamond until I discovered that the general effect is too wide and too Italian compared to original French Garamonds (from the various original books I had in hands from Estienne and others at the Imprimerie Nationale). Then, Stempel one, despite its angular shapes and Berthold Garamond despite not very available today as before, seems booth better. <br> <br>(don't miss Augereau designed couple of years ago, another good one -- but a bit decorative on some forms). <br> <br>I can't comment on Sabon Next for obvious reasons.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I would recommed the only digital Garamond that has decent optical scaling: the ones by Valdonega. They have both a Jannon and a Garamond with 4 optical sizes just for text setting. But for better or worse they're not for sale. <br> <br>But we really need to look at the metal ATF Garamond: every single size was optically scaled. <br> <br>hhp <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Albert Barwick! yes got it! thanks. <br> <br>"complaining" <br>I complain myself that Sabon Next Regular is printed too light on the Linotype specimen. But some friends have say to me that german printers like pale printing (?! the black ink is a bit grey) So, I wait for the second edition due in next couple of days-weeks to see. <br> <br>The Prix Charles Peignot book (composed in Sabon Next too), is better inked to my eyes. <br> <br>What can be wonderful, is too see a book composed with various Garamonds available on the market, each used at their best size. From the "1530" to the Berthold, Stempel, A Garamond, Sabon Next, etc. The result will be appealing to the eyes as old books can be. <br> <br>What about a Founders Garamond?

<div class=commentbody><i>"Albert's laser printer."??? explain please!</i> <br> <br>Albert was complaining that Sabon Next was too dark, but we speculated that this was due to his laser printer. Stephen suggested that dark type can be a good thing, as demonstrated by Fred Smeijer's types, but I think there is a difference between type that is intended to be dark and type that just ends up that way because of a printer.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Narrower 0 than O is not a "convention" to me its just because figures are designed at 90% tabular (all designed on same width). <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> it leaps out from the page or back of a van <br> <br>You mean just the zero? Do you think laymen have the same problem? <br> <br>> narrower width for 0 than O <br> <br>I don't think that's enough, like when you have caps and numbers intermixed (like in a FedEx tracking number). A slashed (or dotted) zero is the least confusible, but it's a bit brutal. <br> <br>BTW, when I said "elegant" I didn't mean aesthetically, I meant functionally. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>And finally I got around to the tally. <br> <br>Adding up the conversation after the initial report the results are thus: <br> <br>Stempel Garamond - 4 endorsements <br>Adobe Gramond - 3 endorsements, 1 mention <br>Garamond - 2 <br>Garamond Pro OTF - 1 <br> <br>and additionally: <br> <br>Sabon Next - 2 endorsements (one specifically for text, display and addition to personal library) <br>Berthold Garamond - 1 endorsement <br> <br>So the standings remain pretty much the same but the really great thing is the mention of many others that we may consider in selecting a Garamond: <br> <br>1530 (Tiro Typeworks) <br>ATF Garamond (metal) <br>Augerneau <br>Founders Garamond <br>Jannon Text Moderne (Storm) <br>Monotype Garamond <br>Sabon <br>Valdonega Jannon (Not for sale) <br>Valdonega Garamond (Not for sale) <br> <br>Thanks everybody!</div>

<div class=commentbody>John, <br> <br>Don't forget Garamont by Goudy, <i>Lanston.</i> <br> <br>I had another look.

<div class=commentbody>So when's this great new Adobe Garamond revival due out, and how will it differ from the current version? Will it be more historically authentic, or geared more toward modern use?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Let's see: <br> <br>- I can't say when it will be out. <br>- It will be completely different from the existing Adobe Garamond, with the two exceptions of being designed by Robert Slimbach and being based on the work of Claude Garamond. <br>- It will be more historically-based than Adobe Garamond is.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just so. I think the new design will co-exist quite happily in our library with Adobe Garamond; each will serve its own purpose. <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gerald: Sorry for that oversight. I had it written down on my notes, but got diverted by speling misteaks. Thanks for reiterating it. <i>...and also Garamont by Goudy, Lanston</i> <br> <br>No, I don't know Jim, but wouldn't mind an introduction or some time to meet.

<div class=commentbody>Thomas: It sounds like you're saying this new Garamond revival is more of a display font if it'll "co-exist" with the current version. I was hoping for a more beefed up and expanded text family, along the lines of JFP's Sabon Next. Do you have any advanced pictures you could share with us?</div>

<div class=commentbody>No, the new Garamond will have a full range of optical sizes, and in many other ways be more complete and extensive than the existing Adobe Garamond Pro. <br> <br>I would love to share more with you all, but I really can't get into more specifics at this time. Maybe at TypeCon or ATypI we can do some big unveiling.... <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>
