  is a fat face that works at any size. Capitals with sweeping curves and sharp unbracketed
  serifs command attention while charming minuscules expose the amiable side of its
  demeanor.\r\n\r\nSybarite is James Puckett's revival of the fat face type that appears
  in the 1829 specimen of Alonzo W. Kinsley's Franklin Letter Foundry. Kinsley's was
  a very short-lived and unprofitable business. It opened in 1825 (some sources say
  1829) and ended in 1832 upon Kinsley's death.\r\n\r\nHigh-contrast typefaces like
  Sybarite have thin hairlines that translate poorly to scalable digital type. A hairline
  thin enough to remain a hairline at large sizes disappears at smaller sizes. And
  a hairline serif drawn for small sizes turns into a slab serif at large sizes. Solving
  this problem requires the creation of optical weights; fonts tuned for a certain
  size range, just as they existed in the era of metal type.\r\n\r\nThanks to James
  Montalbano, who advised on the design of the Roman during a class at the School
  of Visual Arts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dunwichtype.com/?page_id=1623\">Read

    you consider making contextual alternates of the swash italic /N/U/V/W/Y/ with
    reduced terminals, akin to what you did with roman /F/T/?\r\nYour fatface pipe

  body: "I just had to do the alternate italic x. I have never especially liked the
    traditional double-c italic x in fat faces because it is often illegible outside
    of familiar words. I spotted the x in <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/allegro/\">Allegro
    by Hans Bohn</a> when I was reading through Mac MacGrew\u2019s <em>American Metal
    Types</em> and decided to draw something similar. But then I noticed how well
    the double-c x worked in Matthew Carter\u2019s Big Figgins, and that inspired
    me to stop being lazy and work out a double-c x that I was happy with. \r\n\r\nI
    did think about playing around more with the alternates, but that kind of thing
    can snowball out of control, especially if there are accented versions. When I
    researched contemporary usage of fat faces I found that designers rarely use swash
    caps, so I decided it was not worth the stress or time. And there are real limits
    to what I can do with the swash caps because the overall style of Sybarite is
    intentionally stiff. You can see this in the swash V, W, and Y; the ball almost
    seems tacked on at small sizes. To really make the swashes work Sybarite would
    need to be a curvy fat face with bracketed serifs. This is why the historical
    swash K and X did not make it into the final version.\r\n\r\n<cite>Your fatface
    pipe (|) made me smile!</cite>\r\n\r\nI try to make all the oddball characters
    useful in every font. Things like pipes, daggers, and pilcrows are rarely used
    outside of regular and bold fonts. So I exaggerate them into ornamental versions
    of themselves."
