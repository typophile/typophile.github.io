  body: "Well, I'm no expert, but I think that a part of the post-modernism movement
    was pluralism in society, the acceptance of multiple concurrent styles in varying
    directions.\r\n\r\nI don't see that ending, and I certainly see it in the world
    around me.  There will always be certain Milestones in design, be it good or bad,
    that all of the styles have to endure and survive through.\r\n\r\n'Web 2.0' and
    whatever the heck that means anyway, is certainly purported to be a 'design style'
    that people want and misapply.  I'm sure this will be remembered as a failed sidenote
    of design history in the future.\r\n\r\nHope that at least gives you some idea
    that might help you spring off and find some information that could be valuable
    to you.\r\n\r\nBest of luck on your search!"

    It has few questions about my research, it would be great if you fancy to participate.
    \r\n\r\nThanks very much for your comment. I've recently heard about Web 2.0 and,
    I didn't have any idea about it. Your argument is very sensible and I reassures
    my point of view. \r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\nBest wishes, \r\nLaura"

    period that we call \"postmodern design\", to give a name to what came afterwards.
    However, there is an excellent essay/interview with Rob Giampietro that appeared
    in Emigre 65 (or was it 64?), \"Default Systems in Graphic Design,\" which you
    can find <a href=\"http://www.studio-gs.com/writing/index.html\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n(For
    some more comments on Emigre 64, a.k.a. \"Rant\" see the Speak Up discussion <a
    href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/001794.html#001794\">here</a>.)"

  body: "Postmodernism emerged before digital culture.\r\nAs something that is more
    related to the technology of the present era, perhaps Populism--meaning that whereas
    before, design was the preserve of a professional minority, now it is something
    that anyone can do.\r\nPerhaps not in every field of design, but certainly in
    graphic design and typography.\r\n\r\nRelated to this, and the idea of Defaultism,
    is that as with any technological revolution that makes a previously professional
    skill do-able by anyone, automation is a feature of Digitalism, so amateur practitioners
    will stick with the pre-sets, and this most basic mode will be adopted by professionals,
    as they shift their attention to meta-levels of design.\r\n\r\nNot to say that
    Populism wasn't around before--the Last Whole Earth Catalogue (1970) advocated
    a grassroots socio-political revolution riding the technology of photocopiers
    and IBM Selectrix (golf ball strike-on) typesetting. Punk-rock zines followed
    through on that.\r\n\r\n(Fontism.com is presently under construction, as the making
    of fonts is getting in the way of making that a movement. But perhaps it already
    is.)"

  body: "I think we have to watch the art world a bit on this. The whole \"Post\"
    tag is a bit problematic in a way because it is so presumptive. How could art
    be created in contemporary culture that is not post-modern? I guess the answer
    is authentic primitivism, which given the current economic situation may be the
    hot new thing, but then we would have to completely lose the thread of history
    to get there.\r\n\r\nWe also flirt with the idea that artists no longer have to
    produce an object of commerce. Simple actions or perceptions can be art. Do they
    then have to be documented? What are the rules? Maybe this is post-art? If we
    conclude that artists are held up as great primarily to feed institutions that
    perpetuate the elevated value of the individual rather than on the basis of some
    super esoteric measure of skill that requires an expert to define, then the act
    of making art becomes naive, or simply no more revered than any other act. I'm
    totally wanking so I'll stop."

  body: "Laura, I did not mention the term \"post-modern\" as an actually viable or
    reliable expression. Nick is right by saying changes happen on different levels,
    and often the formal and artistic movement express ideas which are also independent
    from them.\r\nI like Innovati's answer, since he sees what are the positive elements
    following the many ideologies we could call \"modernity\". Although it could be
    misleading, it's maybe useful to relate modernity with the industrial revolution,
    but the idea of a fascination with \"modern\" is prone to emerge in any moment
    in history, so I would simply say I use \"post-modern\" to indicate a span of
    time where previous ideas are discussed, while looking for a balance renewal.\r\n\r\n<cite>

    yields better results. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m the only person that has
    found the oddity in the post-modern tag. Everything now produced after 1954 can\u2019t
    all be post-modern. I guess the neo prefix subverts the post power in some way.
    Outsider and naive art can include artists that never made it to a modern sensibility.
    Maybe I\u2019ve just read the word conflate one to many times."

    that over [[http://typophile.com/node/52083|here]].\r\n\r\nWords denoting a time
    period are fine, but when their meaning is synonymous with \"the present\" the
    term is immediately obsolete as time moves on, and then gets silly when appended
    to make it mean \"after the present\" (but isn't \"futurism\" which was a subset
    of \"modernism\" from nearly a century ago). \r\n\r\nWhat do we do when now becomes
    then and we need to describe the next now? \r\nWithout indicating a guiding design
    feature or more general philosophy these words are nothing more than calendar
    markers, and ambiguous ones at that."

    good! I found very interesting the points he make about the use of the ornament
