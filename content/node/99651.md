  body: "a little online research hints that these are fonts available only through
    installation of your printer, and only seen by the printer. it may be that you
    have them on an installation disc or that they are hidden in your system somewhere.
    they seem to be named \"Font11a\" and the like. here's an article that shows some
    of this info.\r\n\r\nhttp://sandstorm36.blogspot.com/2012/09/proper-fonts-for-dot-matrix-printers.html\r\n\r\nnote:
    this is simply a guess, based on the examples provided."

  body: "Yes, this is from an era* when -with few exceptions- fonts were only ever
    stored in the printer's firmware and all the computer sent to the printer was
    ASCII codes (plus some control codes). I remember however that some printers did
    allow you to download custom fonts to the printer - which is how my brother and
    I got Armenian (and Arabic) to print on our Star Micronics NX-1000, circa 1983!
    It <em>might</em> be possible to go the other way and get the fonts out of a/that
    LQ 1050, but of course they won't be bezier-curve fonts, so they can't really
    be re-used...\r\n\r\n* Although for duplicate forms impact printers <em>still</em>
    matter...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
