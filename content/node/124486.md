    that. It\u2019s pure mathematical logic and therefore undeniable. It doesn\u2019t
    require any \u201Cmetal type guy\u201D saying so in a \u201Cmetal type book\u201D.
    \r\n\r\nThe first baseline is at \u201Ctop edge\u201D (0) + x.\r\nThe top edge
    of the second line is at 0 + point size (y).\r\nThe second line\u2019s baseline
    is at top edge of the second line (=point size) + x.\r\nThe difference between
    each consecutive baselines is therefore y + x - x = y (=point size). "

    out a case where this isn't true, in his only example of a metal type sort in
    the newly added spread on setting lead type.\r\n\r\nFor a reference, see Ralph
    W. Polk's The Practice of Printing, or even better, Printing for School and Shop

    that he was looking for a reference for Wikipedia."

  body: Not completely true. Monotype would cast type on a smaller measure on request,
    eg 12 on 11, etc. I have seen references to this in catalogues.

  body: "Well, it certainly is true from mathematical logic when the type in both
    lines belongs to the same font.\r\n\r\nIt can be false, though, if the first line
    is Century Expanded (set on the Standard Line) and the second line is Cloister
    Lightface (set on the Art Line or Script Line). In the case of metal type, the
    position of the baseline within the metal type slug is variable depending on the
    typeface. (I see, though, you specifically said \"in a given font\".)\r\n\r\nIn
    the late 19th century, for the convenience of printers, the major typefaces made
    their types lining by having only three standard baselines - one for classic typefaces
    like Caslon or Jenson, used also for script faces, one for the workhorse faces
    of the day with fairly short descenders, and one for titling faces.\r\n\r\nThe
    differences between these baselines were made to be in whole point increments
    as far as possible - and 1/2 or 1/4 point if not.\r\n\r\nBefore that, the baseline
    was an individual matter, depending on the typeface."

  body: "Bert: True, but that would be specially requested, and then the size of the
    slug itself would be affected.\r\n\r\nMichel: Those citations, although all clear,
    don\u2019t directly address the combination of factors in question.\r\n\r\nYes,
    I should have used the caveat that it is only certain with the same font on both
    lines (although many typefaces use a standard/common alignment). I thought of
    that, and said as much in my report.\r\n\r\nAgreed with all that it seems a simple
    case of logic and understanding, not needing a reference. I didn't use one, in
    the end."
