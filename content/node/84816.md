body: "I'm working on my second typeface, working title is \"Abraham\" for now. This
  will be a real big, bold and solid one, intended for display purposes.\r\n\r\nI've
  been drawing these for a while in cards and posters and bookcovers for example.
  Here are some examples of previous use (these are all handdrawn but I'd like to
  make this into an actual typeface)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5198195522_5c266b3037.jpg\">\r\n<img

  is a first preview of the basic characters:\r\n<img src=\"http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6197/6048988783_1deb70fdcc_z.jpg\">\r\n\r\nIs
  this worth pursuing? I'm considering leaving this all caps and offering 2 or 3 alternatives
  per letterform (more?), so that users can set text that has a real handmade / random
  feel. Is there some kind of way to get open-type software to cycle through these
  alternates? The \"Populaire\" typeface lists that as a feature, although I'm not
  sure how the designer created this... [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/pintassilgo/populaire/]]\r\n\r\nSuggestions
  welcome!"

    on I Love Typography, which you may find useful, and loads of entries on Typophile
    which will help you out with the coding.\r\n\r\nI think you're right to stick
    to all caps, but if you do decide to add lowercase, I'd keep the x-height BIG,
    verging on unicase territory."

  body: On a side note, I'd reconsider Abraham as a name - that sounds to me like
    a stuffy text serif font, but that's just my opinion!

  body: "Hey Dave!\r\n\r\nThanks for the kind words. I kinda like Abraham as it's
    a bit old and rough on the sides (that's my personal feeling of the name though).
    A plus would be that it's going to have a good position in alphabetical lists
    :)\r\n\r\nI'm considering doing lowercase as well, but as you suggested, they'd
    have to be rather big also. Big x-height would be a good thing here I think, so
    thanks!\r\n\r\nWill check out that article (have already read parts of it) and
    look for more info here too. Thanks!"

  body: Hey pals, long time.... I was unable to follow up on this typeface - a long
    story - but I'm back now and ready to move forward. Suggestions both on name and
    font development are most definitely welcome!

  body: "Thanks, good pointers there! Working on those now.\r\n\r\nStill tempted to
    work on lowercase letters as well. As Dave suggested a long time ago I might opt
    for lowercase variants of these uppercase letters, same height as the uppercase
    letters possibly. That would give a user some alternatives when writing without
    me having to sacrifice the display property of the typeface.\r\n\r\nAny pointers
    on kerning by the way? I read up on class kerning - are there new features for
    this in Fontlab these days, or does one still need to write the classes manually?
    (not sure if that is how you are supposed to do it but that's how I did it the
    last time) "
