  question is slightly different.\r\n\r\nWe want to use Courier in our book to distinguish
  programming code, but were frustrated that you can't distinguish some of the characters
  very easily. So I created a variation where you can tell apart 1/l, 0/O, and ~/-.
  All the other characters are the same. (I am surprised that nobody has done this
  before, but I couldn't find anything.)\r\n\r\nWhat are the rules for using/distributing
  this? I assume nobody will care if we use it in print, but what about putting it
  on the web for students to use?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/courierpreview_6617.png]"

    feel like courier still works surprisingly well, and I could switch to courier
    easily.\r\n\r\nI'm glad to see someone doing this. I'm not sure what the rules
    about it are. I'd assume that because it's different in a way that's functionally
    important, it would count as something different, but I really have no idea."

  body: "Andale (and Vera Sans Mono and Menlo, which were our fallback choices) are
    all fine programmer typefaces, but to my eye they are not as immediately recognizable
    when set with other captions (and I don't think they look as nice). We want something
    that is clearly distinct from the sans serif type that we will be using in figures
    and headings, and the Lucida Grande that we are using to indicate menu items....\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comparison_6158.png]\r\n\r\nWe
    don't have to make it public if that is frowned upon, but I just wan't sure of
    the rules. Just seems weird if it is banned, since every computer seems to have
    Courier already.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You could modify an open source version of Courier, such as the one included
    with Ghostscript.  Then there is no question about releasing modifications (you
    just have to follow the license).  The hinting on the Ghostscript font is not
    as refined (it has Postscript curves), but it should be fine for printing.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I like your idea of creating distinguishable characters for Courier.
    \ I understand your desire to have a monotype font that is immediately distinguishable
    from the surrounding text.  Distinguishing Deja Vu Sans Mono from Deja Vu Sans
    for instance is almost impossible."

  body: 'I''ve been on a Courier kick lately after using Vera Sans Mono for several
    years. The first thing I did was to make a modified version like you did. I used
    "Courier 10 Pitch" -- its thicker lines are easier on my eyes. I always have to
    remind myself of which versions of Courier are freely modifiable: Courier 10 Pitch
    and Nimbus Sans Mono have licenses that allow this, but the version of IBM Courier
    that ships with X seems to only allow free redistribution, but doesn''t mention
    modification.'

    funny thing about Courier 10 Point is that the tilde always showed up as a straight
