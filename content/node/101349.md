  \ tee, which has been a minor hit in the lead community. The current design is on
  the woman in the image below.\r\n\r\nA purist pointed out however, that the copy
  block should be upside down, as it's done when type is hand set. Do you feel we
  should offer that as an option as in the mock up on the male below? \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your opinions.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/letterpress-upside-down-alt_4885.jpg]"

    people use a composing stick, but once it's on the press it only depends on where
    you're standing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
