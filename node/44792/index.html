The cut-off "f"s (esp. the biggest one) bother me as they become "t"s, which is confusing. My eye wants to read the white text as "trend"</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments guys. I think the grey could be a great option. Know what you mean about the f's now you say it. I guess my thought was that I just wanted to design it unrestrained and not be held back by anything. I thought that as its a website, nothing else, not a company I didnt have to brand the name at all, and legibility was not that important in terms of logos or anything. I was quite influenced by RayGun music magazine. The whole form over function thingy. But I think I definetely need to work on the large F a bit.

Wordpress indeed. Im knid of new to blogging actually, as you may have guessed :-)
am just figuring it out by reading forums. Will work on the comments.
thanks so much for the comments again.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I actually like your WORK in the portfolio better than the website. Don't really know what it is. Maybe your logo. Not to keen on that now that I see in your portfolio what you can do, but its a straight up nice and easy website. Easy to figure out so I don't waste time on finding my way around - which is very cool.
One more thing. The big fat outline you have on the images in your portfolio kind really irritates my eye - without them - your portfolio would look nice, light and simply and easy to digest.
Looking forward to you blog though...

The only thing, I would suggest is that you put a contact button all over the place. Also I put my phone number on each page. I get people all the time that pick up the phone and contact me right away. After all, you really just want them to contact you.
