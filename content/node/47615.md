  body: "I checked Part 11 of the Script Font ID guide and did not see a match. This
    doesn't surprise me too much, because as we have said many times, this style of
    font can be made from anyone's printing for very little money. There are thousands
    of them on the web, but it could just as easily be a one-of-a-kind font made for
    a business. The closest font I found is a free font called \"Soli\" from [[http://www.pixilate.com/fonts/handwriting/|Pixilate.com]].

  body: "Thanks, I thought this would be a designed font because it looks too clean
    and regular for actual handwriting (at least compared to my standard in the matter
    :).\r\nI find most designed handwriting fonts too calligraphic, maybe not minimal
    or authentic enough\u2026"

  body: "Yes, I understand your point about designed handwriting  fonts, and your
    sample is borderline in my scheme of classifying them. The designed fonts that
    I have shown (in Part 6 of my Script Guide) look more precise and controlled,
    like engineer, draftsman, or architect lettering. I thought your sample was supposed
    to look like someone's 'civilian' printing, but of course it looks like it was
    done by a trained hand. This is why I think it seems likely that this font was
    a custom job, particularly if this sample is from any sort of advertising.\r\n\r\n-
