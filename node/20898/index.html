  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>My questions about Caslon the other night had me comparing various version of Caslon to one another, as well as to other fonts. I hadn&rsquo;t visited Mac Rhino (<a href="http://www.macrhino.com/">http://www.macrhino.com/</a>) in a while, so I thought it might be time to look up a font that caught my eye earlier this year: Tarocco.</p>
<p>I was impressed with the lovely .pdf specimen, and I determined that Tarocco&rsquo;s generous x-height and airy (but not disturbing) spacing would serve me well. I decided to throw Stefan Hattenbach a few bucks and purchased the font set. I must say, that .pdf really showcased the font beautifully. It was quite effective! Boy am I pleased. Seven weights, including sc/osf faces as well as some basic ligatuers. Although I would have liked a few more ligatures and some ornaments thrown in, I figured the former was due to the overall spirit of Swedish design (right?), and the latter due to keeping costs reasonable. What a great value.</p>
<p>My question is about the small caps: Maybe I should know better, but there is no Medium small caps set included. It&rsquo;s there for the Roman, however. I prefer to use the Medium for extended text work because (surprise, surprise!) it&rsquo;s a bit more meaty. I have to use the Roman small caps with the Medium. Is this a normal situation? The Roman (non-medium) small caps seem to work well with the Medium, but I still wanted to know whether this is usually a typographic no-no. Or is my eye still the best judge?</p>

<p>Thanks for your positive thoughts of my typeface Tarocco. This was my first major text face and I&rsquo;ve made more ligatures in my later ones (Delicato and Anziano). My intention was to keep it as an original text face for books. These usually don&rsquo;t carry small caps or italic ditto for other weights than the Roman/Regular one.</p>
<p>Good news about Tarocco though. Very shortly I will have another &ldquo;set of Taroccos&rdquo; released at Psy/Ops Type Foundry. All weights will carry OSF (redesigned) and some newly designed ornaments.</p>
<p>Regarding your question about mixing weights&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s a total &ldquo;No No&rdquo;, but maybe not &ldquo;normal procedure&rdquo;. On the other hand if it looks good with your eyes. I would say it&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;m sure there are many different perspectives on this one&hellip; let&rsquo;s see about other comments?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Stefan,</p>
<p>Once again, thank you kindly for producing such a great typeface for the rest of us to enjoy.</p>
<p>The Roman small caps seem to work fine with the Medium weight, although I realize it&rsquo;s meant for use with the Roman. And that&rsquo;s alright. The Roman looks great as well. I think the solution (to suit my particular tastes) would be to set the leading a little tighter when using the Roman. And I must admit, the finer details of the font show best when using the Roman, obviously.</p>
<p>I look forward to your next set of Tarocco faces. Thanks again.</p>
