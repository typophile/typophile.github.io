  really dumb question.\r\n\r\nI have a stencil font that I quite like, but the creator
  went a bit crazy adding stencil lines into letters that don't need them (such as
  T and K), and it feels inauthentic and distracting to read. \r\n\r\nIs there a program
  I can use to edit the letter shapes embedded in the TrueType font file?  Or is it
  only possible to completely recreate the font in curves and generate a new one?"

    Editing a font requires quite some time (and you have to learn the font editing
    program)."
