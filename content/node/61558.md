  I\u2019m new here. I like fonts and many cool techno records you have never heard
  of. I am currently seeking the name of this typeface in use on the poster of my
  good friend Gabriel Morales. I feel aroused by these voluptuous bowls on letters
  \u2019R\u2019 and \u2019P\u2019. \r\n\r\nCan anybody please help me out here?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Welcome. I have no idea, but I like it too. Looks like a blend between Eurostile
    and DIN. Nice.

    of monospaced fonts. Otherwise, it seems a wider version of Geogrotesque:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque/"
