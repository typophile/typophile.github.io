  the same font as the \"roberto cavalli\" logo. i am doing my own research now (and
  did a search on here to see if this already came up), but i know we have some real
  geniuses on this board, so i would appreciate any help or tips!\r\n\r\nthanks in
  advance, you guys are the best!\r\n\r\nsincerely,\r\nc\r\n\r\np.s. i imagine it
  is most likely a custom-drawn logo, but it is probably based on an existing font,
  right? or how could i approximate it as best as possible? that cool lower-case narrow,
  rounded r, for example,or the e, with the diagonal bar. i am looking through compressed,
  gothic fonts, maybe with a slight art-deco styling to them? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cavalli_logo_5958.jpg]"

    a long way away, though. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roberto_4012.jpg]"

  body: "hey thanks sihep this is excellent!!!\r\n\r\ni think this is very very close,
    at least for my purposes.\r\n\r\ni guess the biggest difference that i can see
    is just the rounded/smooth corners of the original logo, that organic quality
    it has.\r\n\r\n(what is that called btw? when the edges and corners are soft and
    worn in, like old, real type, vs. the hard geometric edges of vector-drawn fonts
    --  like that organic font used a lot now in new york magazine)\r\n\r\nalso, the
    \"t\" is a bit different, the terminal and the crossbar, and the cavalli logo
    is more oval/oblong, whereas this one is taller and sharper, but it is FANTASTIC!\r\n\r\ni
    can also work with the ascenders and make the shorter, and that will help the
    x-height look more similar.\r\n\r\nand you know what, i actually like that thin
    version much better than the real logo!\r\n\r\nand, just to show you how great
    it is, let me show you where i was -- i was way back with bodega sans light! yikes!\r\n\r\nthanks
    again!!![img:sites/default/files/old-images/cavalli_bodega_5748.jpg]"

    Glad that was helpful, though. There\u2019s also Dax Condensed Medium from FontShop
    with a similar \u2018r\u2019 and \u2018e\u2019 but it doesn\u2019t have the same
    retro look.\r\n\r\n\"i guess the biggest difference that i can see is just the
    rounded/smooth corners of the original logo, that organic quality it has\".\r\n\r\nHad
    a quick look at www.robertocavalli.com and think the type has hard geometric edges
    \u2013 those might just be pixels.\r\n\r\n\"what is that called btw? when the
    edges and corners are soft and worn in, like old, real type, vs. the hard geometric
    edges of vector-drawn fonts \u2014 like that organic font used a lot now in new

    those with \u2018Antique\u2019 after the name\r\nhttp://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/p/packard.htm\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=204383\r\nhttp://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/r/romanant.htm\r\n\r\nHave
    also heard \u2018distressed\u2019 used but think this refers to mid-1990s CalArts/Cranbrook
    font-mangling rather than just including irregularities from letterpress or a
    typewriter. You should post the question and get a proper answer from someone
    who designs typefaces. \r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\n"
