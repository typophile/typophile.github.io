body: "i don't think those are fonts that i could buy and use on a computer, but i'm
  looking for anything more or less similar. more so for the angle script than the
  \"blockletter\" (weird sans). thanks for any help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts_3433.gif]\r\n\r\nsorry
  for the small image, i don't have anything bigger. anything near it will do, doesnt
  have to be an exact ID."
