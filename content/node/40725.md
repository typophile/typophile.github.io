body: "I'm working on a newsletter for a band in New Mexico, and we thought it would
  be interesting to use the [[http://www.iginomarini.com/fell.html|Fell types]] for
  everything, at the authentic sizes specified by Igino.\r\n\r\nThe largest size he
  has is the De Walpergen Three Line Pica, at 41pts, with a nice range of sizes smaller
  than that.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to find for the nameplate of the \"authentic\"
  newsletter is a blackletter that the Oxford University Press would have had from
  the same era. I had read somewhere that De Walpergen had come from Germany and had
  cut some blackletter for the press, but it didn't specify what that might be.\r\n\r\nAccording
  to James Moseley's blog at [[http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2006/01/materials-of-typefounding.html|typefoundry.blogspot.com]]:\r\n<cite>the
  establishment of the press and its typefoundry is due chiefly to John Fell (1625\u201386),
  Dean of Christ Church and Bishop of Oxford, for whom matrices were bought in Holland
  in 1670\u201372 and who established a resident punchcutter in Oxford (Peter de Walpergen).
  In addition to Walpergen\u2019s punches and matrices, the earlier materials in the
  collection include matrices for types by Robert Granjon, Pierre Haultin and (possibly)
  Claude Garamont.</cite>\r\n\r\nSo I suppose it is reasonable to assume that they
  had in their collection a blackletter from any of the above sources, be it from
  Holland or from Granjon &c. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a cut that is available
  that might fit the description? Also, it might be a bit much to ask, if you know
  of any \"worn\" blackletters that might match the Fell types?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: D'oh! But you can't buy them individually. I'll take a look and see if I can
    find a close match.

    what is available from the free font movement folks. Not often the best but sometimes,
    in regard to historical interests, quite concerned and useful. The foundries aren't
    always the answer. They have to make a buck. The free font folks obstensibly do
    it for love.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "I've been looking through the Steffman stuff. Blackletter, it seems, is what
    he's contributed. I suppose there's not much demand for authentic revivals of
    blackletter types that died out of common usage a long time ago.\r\n\r\nThe English
    Textura font they have is authentic enough for my purposes, ink spread and all,
    but not at the right display size.\r\n\r\nI'm being stubborn, but ideally, I'd
    like to find a blackletter ranging from 50 to 72 pt. Did they even make textura
    that size? I know they did later, hence the nameplates of newspapers, but would
    that have been available at the same time as the Fell's?"
