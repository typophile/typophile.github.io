  not sure if the current redesign uses it, but this is from 2009.\r\n\r\nIt's similar
  to Didot, Bodoni, Benton Modern Display etc., but I can't quite pin it down.\r\n\r\nSorry
  for the unsharp image.\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fortune_font_4546.jpg]"

    [[http://moderntypography.com/Typedesign/Brunel/index.html|here]] and [[http://christianschwartz.com/brunel.shtml|here]].
    The models for this face, which is a British Modern, are a bit later than the
    models for Matthew Carter's Miller, which is a Scotch Roman. Contact us at info
    (at) commercialtype.com if you are interested in details on how to license this
    family."

  body: "Thanks for the reply. I should've known that it's by Paul Barnes, because
    I had earlier been looking at [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/austin/austin|Austin]],
    where I can see a lot of similarities - especially in the italics. \r\n\r\nBut
    thanks for the info, and I'll get back to you, if I need info on getting a license
    for this one."

  body: "Sorry to contradict my esteemed colleague and partner at Commercial Type,
    but Brunel for the most part uses models that are earlier than Miller. Brunel
    draws most of its inspiration from the moderns that Mrs Henry Caslon started producing
    around 1796, believed to be cut by John Isaac Drury. Some of the punches have
    survived and are at St Bride Printing Library. Miller draws on the Wilson specimen
    of 1812, and the Miller specimen of 1813, though in a looser manner than Brunel
    sticks to Drury. For example the lower case g clearly belongs to Wilson\u2019s
    English No. 1 circa 1789, the model for Mardersteig\u2019s Fontana and David Quay\u2019s
    Wilson. For a more detailed analysis see James Mosley\u2019s article \r\nhttp://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007/02/scotch-roman.html\r\n\r\nOf
    course the reality is that Scotch Romans and British Moderns are quite close,
    and Miller and Brunel share much of the same DNA, which Mosley covers so well
    in the English Vernacular (Motif 11) "
