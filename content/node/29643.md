  interview at the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague, The Netherlands. I think I'm
  going to be alright, but I haven't got the slightest on what I can expect. I've
  got a good portfolio I think. I have lots of sketches in there, not just final products.
  I heard admission commitees like sketches. Apparently the creation process is more
  important than the final product, which I think is rubbish... but hey, if they want
  sketches, they'll get them.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise, I don't know what will happen,
  and I'm quite nervous. I suppose most of you have attended some form of formal art
  education in the past, so I was wondering wether anyone of you had any suggestions
  or pointers?\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nWouter Spaak\r\nNijmegen, The Netherlands"

      is a variant on the old fence post method.\r\n\r\nCreate build up by having
      a clean and tidy case, start with one of your best pieces (the initial drop),
      and then spread the next best works equally throughout (the smaller hills and
      loops). Then end with a jerk - a piece to leave an impression with the reviewer.
      \r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: Also a question on volume of my portfolio... Though I've gathered some fifty-odd
    pieces I'm actually content with, I've only included fifteen or so works in my
    portfolio, mainly because I didn't have enough time to write a detailed description
    for fifty pieces before it went off to the printer's. Is fifteen enough, or should
    I just have entered everything?

  body: "Get in contact with current students and ask them about the admissions department.
    Its a great way to find out what the people working there want to see (or not
    see!), for example, if they're going to expect you to have some good figure drawings
    in the portfolio it's best to know that ahead of time. \r\n\r\nHere in the states
    most schools want to see twelve to twenty pieces, and it's usually a good idea
    for at least half of them to be at least 18\"x24\" in size. \r\n\r\nLastly, don't
    show anime/manga styled work unless it's outstanding. Art school admissions departments
    throw away piles of anime/manga portfolios every day because they get so much
    of it, and art teachers don't like teaching kids who believe that line art is
    the ultimate achievement of human civilization."
