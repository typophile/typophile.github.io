body: May sound like i'm contradicting myself when I say I want to find 5 typefaces
  that are very different but go well as a set. I have been tasked to create a set
  of rules for a group of shop owners who will be given the choice of a typeface to
  display their shop name. The collection of shops will be under one roof and will
  form a market. The market also has a slightly more modern twist. I want to create
  some cohesion but retain individual uniqueness. Any thoughts?

    myself.

  body: There may be a high turn around of tenants so to draw a bespoke face for each
    and every one would be unfeasible (to the clients pocket anyway). We want to be
    able to hand over a kit of parts so the shop owner, if they don't already have
    a brand, can create their own with typeface selection, colour, patterns, finishes
    etc

    more fancy, I would find a suite of Jos Buivenga\u2019s new Geotica and my own
    Reinstaedt quite lovely:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Geot_Reinst_5964.jpg]\r\n.\r\nIf
    it\u2019s to be more cool and sans, take a look at the 9-fonts family of [[http://typophile.com/node/71254|Lapidaria]]."

  body: "Your situation reminds me of something I read once about Disneyland & Disney
    World.  They each have a Main Street USA -- a turn-of-the-century street with
    shops, fire station, etc. -- and Disney executives are often contacted by officials
    of real towns who are so impressed by Main Street's design that they want to know
    how they can create a similar look in their own home towns.\r\n\r\nDisney execs
    tell them that all the shops on Main Street were created with coordinating fonts,
    colors, architecture, etc., to a degree that would never be possible in a real
    town.\r\n\r\nBut since your situation is several shops under 1 roof, you have
    an interesting opportunity."

  body: "I'm sure it would be possible to pick five faces, but I first thought of
    the way in which the FontShop logo may be used with different typefaces, and yet
    still maintain a consistent brand. You wouldn't want to have such a dominant overall
    theme, but that kind of idea might be useful.\r\n\r\nFor instance, standardize
    a format around x-height.\r\n\r\nAnother principle I've used in harmonizing \"super
    families\" is to give them the same degree of horizontal scaling.\r\nFurther,
    a similar kind of \"distress\" (Brown and Worldwide).\r\nAlso, a cultural axis
    (Sense and Sensibility - modernist and humanist variants of the same face).\r\nAnd
    of course a common basic alphabetic architecture (Panoptica, as mentioned above).\r\n\r\nPicking
    different genres within a single type family: Roman, Italic, Alternate script
    italic (e.g. Missinformed), All Caps, All Lower Case, Mixed case, Caps with Small
    Caps, Contrasting Weights.\r\n\r\nInteresting idea, BTW."
