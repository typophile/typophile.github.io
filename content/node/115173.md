    a great alternative.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/code-pro/bold/glyphs.html\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/code-pro/black/glyphs.html\r\n\r\nBut
    if you look at the weights, the condensed lines in comparison, and the stem and
    bar connections, not quite it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/r_4071.jpg]"

  body: 'Totally agree Chris. I''m probably wrong but I''m still thinking it''s a
    custom job based on Avant-Garde Gothic, hardest part would be on /K, /I is not
    hard to reproduce. The rest looks pretty close: circle /O, /R, balance...'

  body: Still on the hunt for this. The new clue is this particular poster seems to
    be an anomaly for the campaign, it also seems to have been done by Pentagram Design.

  body: "After more research I think it is Sharp Sans No. 1 (Black or Extra Bold)
    from Village, with a custom \"I\"  to make it fit design width.  \r\n\r\nhttps://vllg.com/incubator/sharp-sans"

  body: Good catch, Bob! Possibly the closest even if part of the obvious monospaced
    /I some details still look off like /E and /F bar width which look longer on this
    sample (but could have been easily edited like /I to fit design purpose).

  body: I think what is throwing us off is the alterations done to make it fit the
    design concept - as you point out Ryuk this is easily done and makes it a stronger
    poster.

  body: Can't agree more, Bob even if  I've never been a great fan of 'Avant-Garde'.
    That could also explain why top green /E look different from the others and to
    match  Sharp Sans one (or Avant-Garde as well ;)

  body: Thanks guys, Bob you're right, I bow to superior keen eye. I got confirmation
    from the designer from Pentagram studio :-) that did this campaign. I pronounced
    this solved. https://twitter.com/DevaPardue/statuses/460416603713445888
