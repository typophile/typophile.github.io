  for a long time.\r\n\r\nBriefly saying, I'm working on a educational corporate brochure
  with the target audience being middle and higher management. However, it can't look
  too sophisticated - good value for your buck kind of feel.\r\n\r\nI need help finding
  a display and body face.\r\n\r\nFor the display, I like:\r\nSerifa\r\nInterstate\r\nFoundry
  Form\r\nCeacilia\r\nRockwell\r\n\r\nand text:\r\nBodoni\r\nMyriad\r\nTheSans\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think? Serifa with Myriad and The Sans? What about Bodoni?\r\n\r\nPav"

  body: "If you choose from these faces, i\u2019d try Caecilia for body text and Foundry
    Form for display. Bodoni only if you work with a good Bodoni for text sizes (like
    ITC Bodoni 12)."

  body: A slabserif is always the worst possible choice for body text! I love Caecilia's
    curves in bigger sizes, for text I would choose a sans serif above Bodoni, as
    small as possible.

    even compared to Curlz MT! :-\\\r\nSeriously \u2013 that is a dubitable statement
    if I've ever seen one. There are some slabs that read quite nicely (if maybe not
    for entire books). Caecilia is a pretty nice one (although its x-height really
    is a bit large)."
