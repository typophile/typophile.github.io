  body: "I think this may be a mix, with initials from a different font than the other
    letters. The more I look at it, the more I believe that this is handlettered,
    because the identical letters don't appear to be identically formed. It seems
    based on something like [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/uncia/|Uncia]].
    This is for the majority of the letters. The initials are strange, almost more
    like Blackletter initials, although the G in Glass doesn't look familiar at all.\r\n\r\n
