  don't want it to look (a) childish; or (b) handwriting; or (c) cartoon (eg Comic
  Sans!)\r\n\r\nI want it to be soft, personable, approachable, warm, serious not
  flippant but not too formal.\r\n\r\nAppreciate your help!"

  body: "I think it is going to depend on the \"logo.\"\r\n\r\nIf the logo is serifed
    then look at some sans. If it is all caps then set the tag in Cap and lower case.
    If it is upright then set the tag in italics. If it is, say, condensed the go
    with a wider style. Etc. ad infinitum. Look for contrast... Once you have defined
    the parameters of what you are looking for try Veer or MyFonts-all the usual suspects.\r\n\r\nOr
    you could set it in the same face, just much smaller.\r\nMichael"
