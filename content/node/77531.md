  like Helvetica Black but then there's no vertical lines on the lowercase \"U\" for
  example. Also, that apostrophe is pretty unique. \r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uncle-sams-logo_4642.jpg]"

  body: "The /u/ and the /s/ look pretty much like Futura Bold.\r\nI\u2019m quite
    sure it was based on it, with a custom /c/ (made out of an /e/?), altered joints
    in /n/ and /m/ and obviously a different /a/. Oh, and the apostrophe, too."
