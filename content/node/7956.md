body: Took an exsisting free font made by MS and lined the numbers up so they are
  all even, renamed the font and resaved it as a truetype Mac Suitcase in Fontlab
  4.6, but these bracket characters show up when I scroll across the screen once I&#39;m
  in Quarkxpress 6.5 on Mac OSX Panther. I haven&#39;t seen this happen in any other
  application. <BR>Is this a known issue with Fontlab and Quark? <BR>How do I fix
  it?

  body: Ooops, I forgot to say when it print&#39;s a message comes up saying &#40;The
    font used in this layout may be corrupt and may be substituted by courier. [108]&#41;.  And
    that 108 alert says <BR>&#40;The path name &#34;___&#34; specified in the Windows
    Registry is invalid. Using default path name &#34;___&#34;.&#41; <BR>Does anyone
    have a clue?

  body: That&#39;s a little confusing. It sounds like you&#39;re working on OS X with
    Mac TrueType fonts, but that&#39;s a Windows error message! Of course Windows
    can&#39;t recognize or work with suitcase-based Mac TrueType fonts. <BR> <BR>In
    any case, you are breaking your license agreement with Microsoft by altering the
    font. Microsoft&#39;s license explicitly forbids modifying their fonts. <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T
