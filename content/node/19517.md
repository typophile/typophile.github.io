body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have created a font in Fontlab. I went to use the inbuilt function
  to make it bold and the characters have become distorted, additional points have
  been added and the height in some characters has decresed - do you know what is
  causing this and is there a way to create a bold version of the type face without
  these errors occuring?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Yes! There is no way of just \"bolding\" a typeface. \r\nYou just have to
    design the bold version. You should understand the specific needs \r\nof your
    own typeface. Turning bold is not just pressing a button, that's why designing
    type takes so much time."

    it is possible to design your face with these in mind, to make \"bolding\" easier.\r\n\r\nCertain
    kinds of typeface are more amenable to \"push button\" bolding, for instance light,
    monoline faces."

    ways to make bolding automation less destructive but there is no avoiding a sound
    thorough redraw. Think of  \"Auto\" as a starting point only.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
