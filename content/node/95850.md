body: "I have set myself a challenge to work on my logo and illustrator skills that
  are sorely lacking, as such this is not a professional project but an exercise.
  \r\n\r\nThe mark is for Lotus F1, they are an British motorsport team racing in
  formula one. They have a rich heritage in the sport, and have in the past being
  very successful team. I set myself a short brief...\r\n- Create an timeless icon,
  without bowing to current trends\r\n- Display the heritage of the team\r\n\r\nAfter
  a long sketching process, I have arrived with the attached solution. \r\n- The unlying
  motif is a speedbird, the iconic symbol of speed with strong ties to Britain.\r\n-
  The 7 lines represent the 7 constructors world championships the team has won\r\n-
  The \"CC\" within the wheel are the initials of the founder, Colin Chapman.\r\n-
  [[http://f1tcdn.net/gallery/var/resizes/2012-testing/Jerez-7/lotus.jpg|I have refined
  the motif to emulate the unique nose of the current car.]]\r\n\r\nBefore I redraw
  this rough sketch I would love some honest critique and suggestions to improve the
  mark. At this point, the type is just to show lockup.\r\n- Is the concept too weak?
  Too complicated?\r\n- Does the mark feel imbalanced?\r\n\r\nAny and all input appreciated,
  thank you.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lotus-sketch_updated_4043.png]"

  body: "I feel that you are trying to do a bit too much with the logo. It's a bird,
    it's a car, it has initials. Maybe reduce the load a bit and focus on 2 of those
    3 things.\r\n\r\nAs for type, the '1' seems to be an important element, but is
    lacking in that particular face. It's the runt of the litter compared to the rest. "
