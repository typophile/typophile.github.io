    looks close but can't be positive for matching. Need to dig more.\r\nFor the 3
    other bottom ones, I really couldn't tell at this size. The first line could be
    Helvetica Neue. The second line is a mix of a typewriter (Courier?) and serif,
    Italic and Bold (Times?)."

  body: "Hi Ryuk, Gravostyle is an interesting choice but to my eye, the _A_ is a
    little too narrow, the _d_ looks a little too boxy and the tail on the l and t
    seem a trifle short. Optimo's design note: \"Gravostyle is designed after the
    basic cut of the generic Swiss engraving font system.\" None of the engraving
    machine fonts for which I have samples are any closer. Anyway, I doubt anyone
    would notice if Gravostyle was used as a substitute.\r\nDon"

  body: "Another one is [[http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Typ1451|Type
    1451 LL]] but I don't think it matches either (some letters closer, some less).
    Actually, don't know many 'condensed rounded sans' with such a spurred single
    storey /a... Which finally could appear to be an alternate glyph...\r\nIt has
    also an architectural/engineering/Leroy Lettering feeling like [[http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/bryant-condensed|Bryant
    Condensed]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/planscribe-nf|Planscribe]],
    [[http://www.dafont.com/tgl-0-16.font|TGL 0-16]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/rendering|Rendering]]
    (no lowercases unfortunately) and so... A good one too is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cercurius/simpliciter-sans|Simpliciter
    Sans]]."

    another title sequence.\r\n\r\nGravostyle seems to be the closest fit. Typ1451
    is quite nice and also Simpliciter Sans are all good substitutes as well. \r\n\r\nThanks
    everyone!"
