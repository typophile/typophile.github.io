  and know very little of typography. Could any of you help me with identifying this
  font or point me in a direction as to where to look? I've been trying to figure
  this out for a while and have been browsing 1910-20s fonts but I'm afraid I'm utterly
  unqualified to be looking at this at all...\r\nThank you!!!"

  body: Unfortunately this is not a font at all - it's been hand-lettered by a (rather
    moderately) skilled lettering artist as was common with posters from that time.
    I'm looking to see if I can find anything similar to the main style that's actually
    been made into type, but it's probably unlikely.
