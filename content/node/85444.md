  Ruler\") iam doing is just for training as ive never made a book design. Research
  brought me to some questions and i was hoping someone nice could give me some answers.\r\n\r\nIs
  there any known florence punchcutter (i mean of course 15th and 16th century)?\r\n\r\nWere
  type designs lets say of Jenson used in other cities than Venice, countries and
  were they replicas or cut by him?\r\n\r\nHow long metaltype could last before it
  was unuseable? Is it possible that Machiavelies 1513 Florence book is set with typefaces
  cut by Francesc Griffo?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for any answers"

    told, that zinc plates break at ca. 500th copy, while copper (which is softer)
    gives more - up to 1000 - printouts. The type probably lasted longer, for it was
    a mix of hard zinc and soft lead."

    in english (i understand its supposed to be book for someone who is going to rule,
    but still he had reason to call it ruler not prince). \r\n\r\nI realy should find
    some books about history of printing and not bother you.. ive read books about
    type hisotry but there is not much about actual printing. My bad."

    much it\u2019s used and how is of importance, and also the kind of quality control
    in place. But metal type is a kind of renewable resource, as long as the master
    matrices are still around, new type can be cast of those. \r\n\r\nYou should not
    be confused by the term \u2018cut by\u2019 \u2014 that refers to the master type.
    In short: a craftsman like Griffo creates a glyph by cutting and working a small
    piece of metal. During this process he checks the form by making smoke proofs
    on paper (using root from a candle or wick). Once the glyph is to satisfaction
    the piece metal is hardened (using proven techniques with chemicals and tempering).
    The resulting master is struck into another piece of softer metal. From this the
    type can be cast.\r\nAs should be evident one could strike multiple exemplars
    of these matrices. "

    for the throne; in Latin, <em>princeps</em> means pretty much the same thing.
    The book was written for those aspiring to power; thus, translating the title
    as \"The Ruler\" doesn't take into account the aspirational aspect. If Machiavelli
    were writing today, his titled might be translated as \"The Wannabe Head Honcho\"...or
    not."

    article on the son]] Paulus Manutius (or Paulo Manuzio) that he \"parted company
    with his uncles in 1540, devoting his output to the Latin Classics.\"\r\n\r\nI
    wonder whether the publication of Machiavelli's <em>The Prince</em> in that year
    had anything to do with the rift. 19 years later, in 1559, <em>The Prince</em>
    was put on the Index of works prohibited by the Catholic church. Apparently it
    was on the list until 1966, when the list was abolished. The articles on the book
    report a centuries-old dispute over whether Machievelli intended his description
    of the ruthless ways of a successful monarch as a recommendation, or as a critique
    of monarchy, and implied defense of republican government.  "

  body: "(as I under stand) Machiavelli came from a fairly poor but once well-off
    and respected family. He managed to get a decent education but not a classical
    one. He never studied Greek, or commerce and banking. Florence was a centre of
    Greek scholarship and of trade and commerce at the time. People who wanted to
    get ahead studied those subjects in the same way that they go for MBAs today.
    He said of himself that he \"studied to script rather than to thrive.\"\r\n \r\nUnder
    the Florentine republic, he worked as a <cite>\"Secretary of the Second Chancery
    of the Republic</cite> and<cite> Secretary of the Ten of Liberty and Peace\"</cite>.
    These were a permanent, fairly high level jobs. He was involved in negotiations
    with Spain, France and the Papal States and was in a position to advise the Florentine
    Gonfalonieri (head of state in the republic) on matters of state. \r\n \r\nAfter
    \ the Medici overthrew the republic and re-installed themselves as the ruling
    family, as often happens in the wake of an hostile takeover, former managers were
    liable be executed or exiled - err.... Made redundant. Niccolo was dismissed from
    his job and shortly afterwards jailed and tortured on suspicion of involvement
    in a plot against the Medici. on his release, he went home to the family farm
    and and wrote The Prince, but not as an application for employment with the Medici.
    If it were, it would have been full of the kind of fawning, flattering hyperbole
    of the style with which a duke would have expected to be addressed by a commoner.
    Far from that, the book is a realistic assessment of the politics of his time
    that advises pretty much the opposite to what a Medici would have wanted to hear
    and very little about Lorenzo's magnificence.\r\n \r\nBeing a long time civil
    servant, he did want a job in the Medici government, but he wanted to be hired
    on the basis of his skill and talent in the \"art of the state\" and on his record
    as an honest and loyal public servant. Not his ability to flatter the nobility.
    (turns out he wasn't much of a Machiavellian himself.)\r\n \r\n(I keep a copy
    of the Prince at my desk. If you leave out the bits about killing your rivals,
    it's still chock full-o-good advice for dealing with cubical mates. :o)\r\n\r\nThanks,
    William, for posting the Google Books link to Il Principe.\r\n "

    that The Prince is sort of guerilla book to undermine Lorenzos power. I think
    he didnt even want him to have this book it was Machiavelli style propaganda,
    he just wanted people who pass this book to think its for him. Lorenzo knew all
    these \"ruling tools\" anyway. \r\n\r\nI obviously cant use google because i wasnt
    able to find scan of the Prince from Aldus.\r\n\r\nWell i want to use roman leters
    coz of course i want it to be useable/readeable today. Obvious fontchoice now
    for me would be Bembo, but it just seem to me maybe little overused and it somehow
    lost this historical feeling. Its just personal project and i dont own Bembo but
    ill look for some type from Aldus/Griffo that will look interesting enough.\r\n\r\nThank
