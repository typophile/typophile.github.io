  I apologies.  \r\n\r\nI'm currently thinking about working on creating an online
  font creator with a social aspect surrounding it. I'm thinking about using fontforge
  as the font creator. Since I'm no expert on fonts I would love to hear your thoughts
  about this (should I even bother with it) and also any features you would like to
  see. Thanks"

    app, you can't just port it over with some AJAX. \r\n\r\nAnd Google is rumored
    to working on a browser-based font editor, but I have no details about features."

  body: FonForge is now split into a library (libfontforge) having the non-UI parts
    and a UI on top of it, so it is theoretically possible for someone to write some
    web based UI that interacts with server side libfontforge. Some one would even
    write a native Windows/Mac OS X/GTK/Qt UI for it (there is even an experimental
    GTK UI in FontForge source repository but no one is completing it. GTK3 have an
    HTML5 backend allowing GTK application to be run inside browser).

  body: "This concept sounds quite contrived and based off the formula of \r\n\r\n'great
    idea' = [random topic] + SOCIAL ASPECT!\r\n\r\nThat's not to say it's a bad idea,
    but given this is all we know of it, there's really nothing to judge here. It's
    not the idea that counts...it's the implementation. If it's a good implementation,
    that's what might interest folks.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The social aspect, I can't see but that's probably because I'm not a social
    font designer. For me, social networking is a way of avoiding working on fonts.\r\n\r\nIf
    you include a voting system, notes: there's a vast difference between what's popular
    with the general public and what's popular with designers and typographers. 1001fonts.com
    is an example of what types of fonts rise to the top. I'm not putting those fonts
    down, but that type of listing of little use to designers.\r\n\r\nBut I hate being
    tied to my OS when I make fonts. Persistent, platform independent font software
    sounds like a dream come true. It's not so much a problem that needs to be solved
    rather than <em>wouldn't-it-be-cool-if</em>. Maybe the basic version could be
    free and then in-app-purchase advanced features.\r\n\r\nFontstruct is fun. I love
    it. But I prefer something more along the lines of Fontforge."

  body: Well, I mentioned Fontstruct just as an example of an already existing online
    font tool with social strings attached. Having a more refined tool would indeed
    be great.
