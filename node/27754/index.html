  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">i need some advice regarding the indents (and a few other things) on a some pages for a book about leaving america to live abroad.
i previously posted pages from this book in regards to a different issue here: http://typophile.com/node/27559


<ol> <li>do you think the indents are too wide on the section under the blue box(moving there)? i did this so that indent on the lower section would align with the edge of the text on the upper section. when i reduced the indent, it didn't look too good. 

i guess i might reduce the margins on the lower section to more closely align with the upper section, but unfortunately, i am in the final stage of design with this book and i can't really change things too drastically (344 page count is fixed at this point).

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getting_out_135_4435.jpg]
</li>

<li>what is your advice here? the line about crime is too long to fit on one line w/o creating a widow. i tried reducing the tracking -5 (using InDesign), but i still got the widow. so i made a soft return, but then the word spacing looks terrible. is there anything that can be done?
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getting_out_225_5077.jpg]</li>

<li>also, i am looking for a different font to display URLs. i am currently using knockout junior cruiserwt, but i'm not crazy about it in this context. the font needs to work well with both franklin gothic book and triplex serif
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getting_out_290_4378.jpg]
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getting_out_73_3590.jpg]</li>

<li>and finally, i am wondering what your advice would be regarding indents on this resource section in the appendix. do you think this would benefit from indents?  
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/getting_out_311_4432.jpg]</li> </ol>

thanks for any advice!

		<div class="commentbody">1. A lot of times, things that align metrically can actually not appear to align visually. I suspect that this was due to the rounded edge and the color of that box. Personally, I'm leaning more toward the visually aligned solution; so I would reduce the margin a little bit, and then use H&J to compensate for the lost words. Franklin Gothic's counters are open, too. I think they could withstand some wordspacing adjustments.

2. I think that the rule on widow is not hard-and-fast. In this case, it is fine, especially since <em>harrasment</em> is quite long of a word. Speaking about which, the Other woman's issues section got a short <em>wives</em>. Now that's a widow allright.

3. I would use the existing Triplex serif, set at visually the same x-height as Franklin Gothic. It is distinctive enough to be noticeable among the line of text, yet would still provide some continuity with the context of the book.

4. I don't think so. One or two visual marker to distinguish between one entry and another (in this case, resources set in Bold and leading between entries) are usually enough.

Best of luck!</div>

regarding using triplex - it does look like the x-height is smaller than that of franklin gothic, so to match it would you just increase the point size?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes I think the indents are too wide. It doesnt feel right to me.

Perhaps remove the indent, and have a 1-3pt spacing after the last line in a paragraph to spatially separate sections? Removal of the indent should help towards compensating the 1-3pt line space lost.

The appendix looks good without the indent. The hook is the bold, not the indent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems you have several ways of treating lists:
1. outdented first line, ranged left, ragged right
2. indented first line, justified
3. ranged left, ragged right, line spaced
The consistency seems to come from having the first word(s) in bold. My taste would be to use the bold as the indicator and range left with ragged right on a slightly narrower measure (taken from left and right), not being justified you have greater flexibilty to takeover words to reduce the incidence of widows and not being indented means that the shorter definitions would decrease the stepping effect on the left. You might feel that it needs a little extra linespacing after each entry and if you can do this without adding too many pages it is worth considering.

		<div class="commentbody">I think the indents in the main text are too deep. I'd make them the same as the indents in the blue box.

Agree that boldface and indents may be overkill. For readability I'd either flush the whole thing left or do a hanging indent (what Tim calls an oudent - I'm not familiar with that term) the way you do inside the blue box.

I think the urls aren't quite working - would either boldface them in the Franklin Gothic or try the blue. Depends on how much attention you want to draw to them.

I like the look of the resource section, it's clean and easy to read. No need for indents.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1. Indents should be equal to the leading.

2. A word on a line by itself is NOT a widow. It is a widow ony when it jumps to the next page. You should NEVER track type in text. Adjust your word (not letter) spacing if necessary, but it always looks bad if you if you change your constants -- size, leading, letter spacing -- to fit text.

3. Use Franklin Gothic for your URLs. Make them bold if you want them to stand out.

4. There is no need to indent the resource section. You have already set off each entry with a blank line.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">>outdent - I’m not familiar with that term

I know, it's a horrible construct, surprisingly it is appears in Bringhurst:)

Indents – for long paragraphs 2 ems is better looking to me but for shorter ones 1 lead or 1 em (or even an en) will reduce the jaggedness, but in this case I think the bold and indent is an overkill. 
Although in traditional typesetting parlance a widow is the last line of a paragraph on the next page, it is frequently used for a single word at the end of a paragraph, at least in the UK. I also believe that some tracking is permissable, the amount would vary according to the typeface. On the resource section where it is set ragged right I would look at turning over some of the shorter words (three characters or less), especially where the lines above and below fall short of the measure.

I think you should probably rag right all your lists with heads - it will definitely give you more flexibility re line breaks.

Regarding the traditional indent isn't an em easier to insert in handsetting than a lead since it would be a pain to cut up leads to fit in the extra, while a em quad is instantly available.

		<div class="commentbody">Tim - I don't 'insert' an indent but rather set it up in a style sheet or formatting menu. It isn't a character. Thus it's actually easier to insert a point value, say 14, then an em space. But I guess you're referring to lead type which is a different story. Back in the old typesetting days I used to use em-spaces (that handy square) for indents in my speccing but that feels kind of obsolete since only a traditional typesetter would know the width of an em.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well the em space for 10/14pts would be 10pts, but I was referring to hand composing rather than the magic of technology which allows one to create as many style sheets as you need. I am disappointed that more book designers don't set a style for paragraphs that takes into account quotemarks at the beginning of a para, so that all paras could appear to start at the same position.
