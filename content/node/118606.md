  body: The t tied to the o and e lead me to believe this has been messed with a whole
    bunch and is not a font as such.

      it. \r\nDo you know of any font that is similar to the logo? "

    Gothic]] Bold or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/meloriac|Meloriac]].

      the T have the same slope on the top of the letter. Do you have any suggestions? "

  body: "Kristina, it's not likely that you'll find an unaltered font with that j
    and angled t (Univers and Arial, for instance, have an angled t, but in the opposite
    direction). \r\n\r\nIn addition to Ryuk's very good suggestions, here are a few
    more fonts that might get you closer:\r\n\r\nTablet Gothic Wide:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/tablet-gothic/wide-extra-bold/\r\n\r\nCorporate
    S Extra Bold:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/corporate-s/extra-bold/\r\n\r\nKropotkin
