body: "I check this site quite frequently, just to see what discussions are going
  on, usually just browsing through the homepage articles to see what people are talking
  about.\r\n\r\nThe other day someone had a Type ID question about the Miller High
  Life logo. ( http://typophile.com/node/37023 ). I chimed in with a suggestion (which
  is rare) and today wanted to check back on the thread to see if anyone had come
  up with anything else.\r\n\r\nThinking it would be faster I typed in \"high life\"
  in the search box, which was in both the title and body text of the post, but got
  no results (i tried both with and without quotes around \"high life\"). Then I tried
  searching for other words that appear in the post that I remembered typing \"old
  stock\" \"neighborhood\"... but the post never came up.\r\n\r\nI finally found the
  post, by browsing through the type id forums - but kept trying to see if I could
  get the post to come up through the search box - mostly on principle. It seemed
  like if I couldn't find a post by searching for text that I knew I had typed - what's
  the likelihood of finding the results I want when using keywords to search for a
  topic I'm researching.\r\n\r\nIs there something I'm missing here? Thanks!\r\nConnal"

    will get much better results.

  body: As Tim says, you don't have to search for threads you have posted in yourself,
    that's what the tracker is for. And the search on Typophile only works sporadically,
    so indeed use google for proper search. Somehwat odd solution (just fix that search),
    but it works.

  body: I notice many web sites have a search function tht says "search powered by
    Google". So there must be some way of automatically incorporating the Google search
    capability, probably some scripting available from Google, and probably free.
    Perhaps the Punchcut folks could look into this. Not much point having a search
    function if it doesn't get results. Typophile threads are a valuable resource
    on typography and design. Anyone visiting the site should be able to search it
    effectively without having to figure out that you need to use Google.
