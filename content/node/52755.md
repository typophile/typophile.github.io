body: "<div id=\"content\"><p>This year Fountain has been operating as a type foundry
  for 15 years. To celebrate this we decided to make some changes. <br/>\r\nFountain
  is proud to announce the launch of our new website, a brand new OpenType library
  and the release of 4 new typefaces.  <br/>\r\n <br/>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com\">www.fountaintype.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr
  />\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New OpenType library</strong> <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took
  a while \u2013  a bit longer than we guessed and hoped \u2013  but we are very happy
  to finally have converted the fonts in our library into the OpenType format. It
  has not been an easy task. When necessary we have had to re-drawn the glyph curves
  from scratch and fix old glitches. The glyph sets has been expanded to cover full
  CE support. A full range of different OpenType features has been added. \r\nWith
  this launch we say goodbye to the old legacy (PS1/TT) formats, and from now on the
  Fountain library will be available exclusively in the OpenType format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even
  though we worked hard to get all families ready, there is still a few families not
  fully ready at site launch time. We're working hard on them, and we promise to make
  them available in the beginning of next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We offer upgrades from
  legacy typefaces. Until January 31, 2009 we will offer very generous discounts (up
  to 68% off in some cases).  <br/>\r\nHave you bought any of our \"Std\" fonts (see
  list on the Upgrades page) within 2008 your upgrade discount is even more gentile
  \ \u2013 90% off.<br/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be able to upgrade you must have purchased
  the typeface directly from us.   More info at <a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com/support/upgrades\">www.fountaintype.com/support/upgrades/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr
  />\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New website</strong> <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site has been
  re-designed from scratch with a new strong database foundation. The pages load quicker,
  and we have an easier time updating. Our domain name has changed to <strong>fountaintype.com</strong>
  so will be easier to find us, old links will be redirected and old email addresses
  will still work. <br/>\r\nThe typefaces can now be downloaded directly after purchase.
  We will miss the direct contact with our customers, but this will save time for
  all parties. You are of course still always welcome to <a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com/contact\">contact
  us</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We've added a new way to test the fonts and their OT features
  by using the amazing <a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/lisboa/lettersetter\">LetterSetter</a>
  application so nicely put together by Letterror. It's available through the typeface
  pages, please <a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/lisboa/lettersetter\">take
  it for spin</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 4 new typefaces</strong>
  <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this day of celebration it would be suitable to not only
  update our old fonts, but also to release some new typefaces. We think the selection
  is a nice mix of genres, and we also take the oppertunity to say welcome to two
  new type designers \u2013 Lucas Brusquini and G\xF6ran S\xF6derstr\xF6m.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr
  />\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Atlantik</strong> - Ocean ornaments in 6 fonts</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atlantik
  is a font family filled with ornaments related to the waves . Based on patterns
  from old specimen books it holds a collection of 213 single ornaments divided into
  6 sets.  <br/>\r\nExclusively available in OpenType format. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed

  historical sans serif family</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dessau is a take on Bauhaus typography
  with an Hungarian twist. This typeface family consists of a total of 11 different
  styles, and variations.     <br/>\r\nFull CE support. Exclusively available in OpenType
  format. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed by <a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com/designers/21-g-bor-k-thay\">G\xE1bor

  geometric script in three weights</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origin for this typeface comes
  from an old logotype. But G\xF6ran S\xF6derstr\xF6m has expanded the idea to a large
  glyph collection of alternates, swashes, end-glyphs and ligatures. Lotta Bruhn added
  a set of illustrations in font format to go with the typeface and a set of wing
  initials. <br/>\r\nFull CE support. Exclusively available in OpenType format.<br/>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed

  family rooted in the stars above</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The typeface Tycho started as a college
  project. The printed works of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, was the starting point.
  It soon became clear that the font used was of very poor quality and most likely
  a mix of several different fonts. Gradually the work shifted from pure revival to
  the design of a new typeface. Tycho comes in four styles \u2013 Book, Book Italic,
  Bold and Display \u2013 all with full CE support, Small Caps and OT features. <br/>\r\nExclusively
  available in OpenType format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed by <a href=\"http://www.fountaintype.com/designers/27-lucas-brusquini\">Lucas

  body: Beautifully done, Peter. Fountain's home is now more refined, but still the
    same friendly foundry. I am in love with Dessau. I am also in love with a lot
    of what I know is in the pipeline. I am glad you can focus on finishing those
    new fonts now!
