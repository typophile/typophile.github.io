    for example.\r\n\r\nHow do you end up inches off???"

    prepress shops can handle that via their software for you.

    that.

    creep doesn't compromise the design (by clipping essential parts of it).

    been getting complaints from these printshops saying the document size is off
    by a few mm's (not inches, sorry) including bleeding.\r\nI felt like their messing
    with me, i had it with 3 printshops now.\r\nVery very confusing, cause the other
    says its too much or too little.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you for sharing, i will
    look in to those sources provided.\r\n"

    (Quark being one) has some standard page sizes in the dialogue box when you open
    a new file.

  body: "Well, what do you mean off my a few MM? Is the page size you set up the same
    as the page size you are having printed? The software shouldn't be off by anything.
    It sounds perhaps more like a communication issue between you and the printer.\r\n\r\nAs
    for page creep, when you saddle stitch a publication, due to the thickness of
    the paper, the insise pages 'creep' out away frm the spine more so than the outside/cover
    pages. This is called the creep, and is trimmed off at the end. If you don't account
    for it, you will notice your page margins shrinking as you get to the center of
    the magazine/book. Technically, the signature in the center is going to be narrower
    than the signature used for the cover."

    afford to blame the printshop they might deliver something stretched out or something
    the risk is too much and i think they take this to account too. \r\n\r\nthanks

  body: "To demonstrate creep for yourself staple several pages of gash paper in the
    centre and fold to make a book then trim it to a size, then dismantle it and measure
    the middle spread against the cover, depending on the stock there can be a surprising
    amount of difference, it frequently affects page numbering or running heads since
    they are more often toward the outside edges.\r\nHow are you providing the artwork

    the printer provide a template. I often have publishing clients send me dummy
    books to measure for the jacket, I refuse to do that and insist on a dimension
    chart from the printer to make sure I'm following their guidelines for turn, bleed,
    etc. If there's a mistake let it be on their end, not mine.\r\n\r\nAlso be SURE
    you're clear whether or not the client wants bleed included in the file size or
    outside the trim (I prefer to do the latter). That may be the source of the discrepancy."

  body: "Dimensions from the client, or from the printer, it's the same. \r\n\r\nI'm
    still puzzled by this thread. It's not rocket science. There are standard page
    sizes, if you use those there shouldn't be any discrepancy. If the job requires
    a size that isn't standard you should be working with dimensions provided either
    by the client or the printer.\r\n\r\nAs I said in the earlier post above, make
    sure not to include the bleed (usually 1/8\", 9 points, or 3 mm) in the trim unless
    directed to do so.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, is there no proof stage? The jobs go straight
    to press without anybody checking them?"

  body: 'Here''s a crazy idea prompted by what Patty just said. If you output the
    job and forget to tell it to include bleed, or if the designer doesn''t include
    bleed, then the job could indeed be incorrect size. I remember, maybe 10 years
    ago, digital prepress was still young, people forgetting to design to include
    bleed and then the press would turn around and blame the prepress people and the
    prepress people would turn around and blame the designer. '

  body: Yes, and this should be part of Design 101. It is furthermore why you need
    templates or dimension charts from your client/printer, not to mention guidelines
    for setting up the job (which most printers have, either on the web or in pdf
    form). There should be no guessing games about this. Most printers charge a hefty
    hourly wage to fix simple design mistakes like forgetting the bleed, supplying
    art as RGB instead of CMYK, not setting up your process colors properly, etc.
