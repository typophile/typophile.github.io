  opinion student mag I'm designing. The inside is all Mercury Text & Display for
  headlines and for the nameplate I'm vaguely drawing on inspiration from the New
  York Magazine's swash italic all-caps nameplate. Anyway, the attached image looked
  particularly nice; any ideas what it is? Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/swash_5678.jpg]"
