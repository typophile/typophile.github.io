  /img>\r\n\r\nFrom [[http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/thesans/about/|LucasFonts]]\r\n\r\nThesis
  is a large font superfamily, deisgned in the late 90s by [[http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/thesans/about/|Luc(as)
  de Groot]] of LucasFonts. Thesis fonts have become popular and can be seen in various
  publications or logotypes. The range of weights are designed using de Groot's \"interpolation
  theory\".\r\n\r\nThe fonts include TheSans, a humanist sans-serif similar to Frutiger
  and Segoe; TheSerif, a slab-serif; TheMix, a slab-serif font lacking some serifs;
  and just recently, TheAntiqua, a serif font.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of the family are categorized
  in following family collections: Classic, Basic, Office.\r\n\r\nClassic family includes
  all 8 font weights, with roman, italic, small caps roman, small caps italic, expert,
  expert italic in each weight. It includes hanging proportional, hanging monospaced,
  lining proportional, lining monospaced figures; and additional f-ligatures. Expert
  fonts include arrows, swashes, fraction figures, alternate styles, mathematic symbols,
  ornaments.\r\n\r\nBasic family includes all 8 font weights, but without small caps
  and expert fonts. It includes lining proportional figures (smaller than in classic).\r\n\r\nOffice
  family only includes Regular and Bold weights, with only roman and italic in each
  weight. It includes hanging monospaced figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fonts have been increasingly
  popular in recent years, especially in Europe. Germany has seen it being used in
  the signage of the SPD party, and in their television screens in Das Erste, the
  main television channel of state-owned ARD. Belgians have seen it police cars strolling
  around the city.\r\n\r\nIn America, people see it in Sprint branding, Citizens bank,
  and some services of AOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.designtagebuch.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/spd-wahlplakat.jpg\"
