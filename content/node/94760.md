  example, if I type word:\r\n\r\n<strong>RemarK</strong>\r\n\r\nAnd <strong>K</strong>
  as a last glyph, could it be mirrored on some way automatically?\r\n\r\n"

  body: There are several ways in which this could be approached, but the easiest
    way for your purposes and the mostly widely supported at this time, would be to
    a) create mirrored glyphs in the font and b) use the 'calt' layout feature to
    contextually substitute them when not followed by another letter glyph.

  body: "Would the .fina feature be totally inappropriate for this?\r\n\r\n(Entirely
    possible, because I recall some threads where attempts were made to make .init,
    .isol, .medi and .fina work with Latin fonts, and some software doesn't properly
    handle these four for non-Arabic glyphs. Well, that's what I recall, at least.)"

  body: '''fina'' might work for this purpose in Adobe apps, but I suspect not elsewhere.'
