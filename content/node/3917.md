  body: ' The definition I&#39;m finding for &#34;entasis&#34; doesn&#39;t seem to
    work for that. The action is called &#34;hanging&#34; the glyph over the margin,
    and the more a glyph&#39;s &#34;optical weight&#34; is away from its absolute
    boundaries, the more it&#39;s necessary. In the case of quotes &#40;which are
    small and very off-center&#41; it&#39;s common practice to hang them. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s
    interesting is that -technically- this problem is a hold-over from the metal days,
    when glyphs were necessarily confined to a rectangle &#40;except for the occasional
    physical kern: a protrusion outside the base block, like sometimes in the beak
    of the lc &#34;f&#34;&#41;. Now with digital type and the easy availability of
    kerning, it&#39;s possible to adopt a very different spacing scheme, one that
    allows everything to hang out &#40;thus inherently accounting for optical weight&#41;,
    and relying absolutely on &#40;positive&#41; kerning to fix any collisions. <BR>
    <BR>Unfortunately, virtually nobody does this, because: <BR>1. Type design is
    a conservative field &#40;even after the hooliganism of the 90s&#41;. <BR>2. It&#39;s
    more work: you need a ton more kerning. <BR>3. The user must have kerning enabled,
    otherwise the setting will look like a freeway pile-up. <BR> <BR>The good news
    is that automatic kerning routines &#40;or perhaps &#91;an evolution of&#93; InDesign&#39;s
    optical spacing algorithm&#41; might make this a reality. Result: totally straight
    margins. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Hrant, my English is not quite good enough, but I will try anyway: when
    I was asking for an English equivalent to the idea of &#39;entasis&#39; I was
    asking for a broader term than &#39;hanging punctuation&#39;. Because the way
    we use &#39;entasis&#39; in Danish, &#39;hanging punctuation&#39; is only &#42;one&#42;
    type of &#39;entasis&#39;. Others are &#39;baseline overhang&#39; ... the fact
    that an UC &#39;O&#39; is wider than an UC &#39;H&#39; ... the fact that columns
    in Greek temples are thicker in the middle to appear straight ... <BR> <BR>In
    other words, &#39;entasis&#39; is the conception of &#39;helping &#34;less&#34;
    to look &#34;the same&#34; by turning it into &#34;more&#34;&#39;. <BR> <BR>So,
    if  &#39;Ford&#39; and &#39;Volvo&#39; are &#39;hanging punctuation&#39; and  &#39;baseline
    overhang&#39; ... what is &#39;car&#39;? <BR> <BR>Soren O '

    <BR>Now I understand what you mean. Good question. The few terms that I can think

    expect to find in that kind of dictionary. Yesterday, I nearly posted a follow-up
    just saying &#34;Words like &#39;bouma&#39;&#34;. Instead, I got the idea to see
    if Google knew &#39;bouma&#39;. I learned that the word itself is not new -- there
    is a company in Montana dealing with &#39;Bouma Trucks&#39; or something like
    that. <BR> <BR>Anyway, what should be the name of the thread, and exactly what
    words should be included -- apart from &#39;entasis&#39; and &#39;bouma&#39;?
