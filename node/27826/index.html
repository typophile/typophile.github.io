		<div class="commentbody"><p>Greg,</p>
<p>Is this a logo for you personally, or a logo for you as a freelance designer that serves as a graphic shingle to appeal to folks in the action sports industry?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If it&rsquo;s personal, dig deep and make it about YOU. What makes Greg tick? What arrangement of shapes or icons and/or typography describe you and only you?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s supposed to feel &ldquo;sporty&rdquo;&hellip;well, I&rsquo;m not sure what to tell you. I&rsquo;m afraid it might be too easy to mimic sport logos for the sake of aligning yourself with that look. Again, it brings me back to the original question, as I would bet you might find more value—for you and for your potential clients—by making a personal mark that defines you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been through this exercise in the last year. It&rsquo;s a difficult but very satisfying exercise. For what it&rsquo;s worth, I created a personal logo, and as I worked on it, tweaked it, scrapped it, and redrew it again and again, one of my criteria was, &ldquo;Would I tattoo this on my body when I&rsquo;m done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tattoo happens a week from today. And here&rsquo;s a link to the Typophile thread that shows the mark I created. Listen, I know the clouds aren&rsquo;t going to part with accompanying opera music when you see this. But it was a labor of love for me, and worth the effort. Link:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the response Dylan. To anwser your question it is not trying to mimic or look sporty. I should have mentioned that.</p>
<p>I was trying to really reflect the shape of waves. I am an easy going type guy who loves the ocean.  I also love to dance.(I also do a lot of waves in my dancing.)</p>

<p>Ahh&hellip;now we&rsquo;re talkin'! So, with that, I like where you&rsquo;re going with this. Wow, suddenly I&rsquo;m stoked about the possibilities of your name and how waves/water can be integrated.</p>
<p>Are you a sketchbook guy? Have any existing sketches you&rsquo;ve done for this? If not, have you taken an hour or two to bust out a large sketchpad, a dull pencil, and really enjoy some gestural drawing that might help you explore how these letterforms might, er, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->flow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> into one another?</p>
<p>Great project, man! Keep us posted as you progress.</p>
<p>Dylan &ndash; who might be more stoked about your project than you are.  ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks, yeah the first render was a sketch but it was done with a sharpy and it needed some tweaks but i liked the direction so last night I scanned and traced it.</p>
<p>I would like to bookmark your page. Really diggin your illustrations. Is your site live yet? Do you have an address.</p>
<p>Heres some more work I put into it. Iam still not a fan of the &ldquo;E&rdquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Loose thoughts: I like the contrast between the rectilinear forms and the wavy extensions. There&rsquo;s a beautiful visual connection that&rsquo;s happening between the extended wave form on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->G<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->R<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. And the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->second/last G<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is starting to work&hellip;I think it&rsquo;s a bit disconnected and a little slow to decipher right now because, unlike the other letterforms, it has no rigidity and it&rsquo;s completely freeflowing&hellip; I agree with you about the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->E<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It feels forced&hellip;too tucked behind the other letters. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OK&hellip;what if, as we move from the first G across, the letterforms gradually morph from rigid to wavelike?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This loose train of thought might help you soften that E&hellip;mebbe take it to a lower case, which in turn will allow a more natural curve at the top of the letter.</p>
<p>My site, when done, will be at dylanmenges.com. Should be a few weeks until it&rsquo;s ready. Too many irons in the fire right now.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree Dylan the g and r combo are really what Iam liking. Ive been working on this all day and I realized that after probably thirty sketches and a bunch of attempts I need to emphasize the g and r. IF i carry the decender of the last g underneath the two it takes away from the design.  I think your idea of morphing the letterforms  would be interesting but I havent really put much into it and fear I will drive my self crazy trying to pull it off. I love the concept tho.</p>
<p>What do you or any typophile think?</p>
<p>It definately works well at very small sizes. It just needs a lot of tweaks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This is starting to resemble pictograms, which might not be inappropriate, but the R needs some work around the counter, I think it needs to be closed and some roundness introduced into the top half. I am reading the first G as 6, you could introduce some white lines where the flowing serif crosses the vertical, along the lines of where the lowest bar of the E is flowing into the second G.
