  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Had originally created a logo for a ficticious record label called &ldquo;Fire&rdquo; but decided to take the project further by doing a whole typeface. (Done in Illustrator.) It&rsquo;s a work in progress as I&rsquo;ve literally spent a couple of days on the lowercase characters.</p>
<p>If you image I started with F I R and E, these were made from quarter circles / half arches, depending on what you want to called them. Anyway, the logo looked quite effective (see attached image) so I continue to use the original shapes plus some straight lines.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried not to be too traditional with X-height - the C and E are good examples. The idea is to try and keep the characters as clean and simple as possible. I ran into problems creating a effective S, T and Z&hellip; I&rsquo;m quite happy with the S and T now, but the Z isn&rsquo;t quite right - it doens&rsquo;t look at all right&hellip; I&rsquo;m tempted to go for a simple X-height version, but ideally I wanted it to have a descender, like the C and E. I&rsquo;m also considering losing the dots off the I and J (as the original Fire logo didn&rsquo;t have this.)</p>
<p>Anyway let me know what you like, don&rsquo;t like about it. Would like to finish the l/c before I even attempt the u/c set.</p>
<p>For numbered characters, I was thinking to ditch the traditional idea of English/Mathematical numbers, but to replace with digits or even just the words: EG: &ldquo;3&rdquo; would be &ldquo;three&rdquo; or &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; - that way 131 would be: &ldquo;onethreeone&rdquo; or &ldquo;. &hellip; .&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wish I was a student again, I&rsquo;d have ore time, but would lack money!<img src="/images/old-images/Fire-Text_5007.gif" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/Fire-Logo_4727.gif" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="/images/old-images/Fire-Logo_6062.gif" alt=""><img src="/images/old-images/Fire-Text_3466.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>So the F is causing problems? I kind of like the way it &ldquo;techinically&rdquo; is an F despite it&rsquo;s lack of descender. The text doesn&rsquo;t particularly have to be legible at 8pt, as it&rsquo;s more a club/flyer orientated display font. I&rsquo;ve put some word together and like it but stick need to try it out as a proper font (i.e converted via Fontographer, which I still need to buy!)</p>

<p>The Z was bothering me, too, so I&rsquo;ve changed to a smaller version. I see what you mean about the X and the S.</p>
<p>In regards to the E and F - these were literaly two characters I started with, so the idea was to keep them as they are. But saying that, I see why people would view them with some concern. So what I&rsquo;m thinking about now is to create some alternative lower case characters&hellip; I&rsquo;ll stick a new post on here soon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey this is looking alot better. I like that first &ldquo;f&rdquo;, something about that descender is nice. You might want to carry that look into the &ldquo;t&rdquo; and the &ldquo;j&rdquo;. I see you reworked the &ldquo;e&rdquo; and the &ldquo;s&rdquo; as well, while the letterforms are much more consistant with the rest of the alphabet, they still seem unfinished. Both have a compressed look (as if smushed from the top down.) The &ldquo;s&rdquo; is definitely too wide as well. I know you&rsquo;re trying to make every character unique, I think in this instance, you might have to give up and go with a more traditional look to these characters (follow?)</p>
<p>As far as the Capitals. I&rsquo;m not really feeling the majority of these at all. Most of them look like you took the lowercase letters and extended them or resized and compressed them. While they&rsquo;re not all horrible, I think this might need some new attention.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still very impressed with the look. This will be a fun font when you&rsquo;re finished. Keep at it.</p>

The new version is a vast improvement in legibility &amp; could even work for longer texts.
It&rsquo;s good however that you&rsquo;ve kept the alternatives &amp; added some more (the lowercase g alternative is very nice).
The uppercase G looks a little condensed compared to the rest, maybe it might be better to put the bar on the right side?</div>

<pre><code> I really like this type face, although its definetly not a complete system yet and you should push it further. I know Im coming into this discussion late as its December now and you all havent posted since August but keep up the interesting work! 
</code></pre>
<p>A couple quick suggestions:</p>
<pre><code>- have you investigated what a rounded terminal would do for some of the characters?
- try adding a curling descender to certain letters (k, m, n, etc) like on your 'y' but with an exaggerated curl?
- Your caps do seem condensed, also the B and R have akward bowl shapes, I would reccomend incorporating a look similr to the g, p, q

Im really into this typeface, creating an entire type face is no small task, keep going. I think your number/lettering concept was interesting; kind of out there...have you looked into old numerals with offset baselines? I think you may be apt to follow that route as your descenders are already breaking ground so to speak, I would love to see that carry over into the numerals.
