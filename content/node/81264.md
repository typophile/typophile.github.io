  come from what eras/places, etc.), and I know that there are a lot of books on the
  topic, but which do you guys think are best? I have a pretty standard (i.e. limited)
  knowledge of typographic history (blackletter before oldstyle before transitional
  before modern, etc.), and I want to learn a lot more so that I can better inform
  decisions that I make.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it!"

  body: "Well, Robert Bringhurst's The Elements of Typographic Style is an extraordinary
    book about typography. However, he has his own classification system that is based
    more on art history terms than the \"standard\" oldstyle-transitional-modern classification.
    It's an interesting way of thinking about typefaces but if you use his terms most
    people won't know what you're talking about.\r\n\r\nHere are a few links that
    might be helpful...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/typography-recommended-Hoefler-Tobias-Frere-Jones/lm/R3QWSQ2V1SIZAE\r\n\r\nhttp://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-top-ten-type-resources-online\r\n"

  body: "Some of my favorite type history books:\r\n\r\n(I've omitted ones that are
    on the Hoefler and Frere-Jones list, which is very useful on its own.)\r\n\r\n\"A
    Short History of the Printed Word\" \u2014 Warren Chappel / Robert Bringhurst
    (second edition)\r\nThis is a wonderful overview of general typographic history\r\n\r\n\"Type:
    The Secret History of Letters\" \u2014 Simon Loxley\r\nWhile not a formal type
    history, this is a wonderful collection of anecdotes about specific designers
    and faces\r\n\r\n\"Meggs' History of Graphic Design\" \u2014 Philip B. Meggs /
    Alston W. Purvis (fourth edition)\r\nThis comprehensive textbook covers all aspects
    of graphic design history, not just typography\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I think the
    Bringhurst classifications (Renaissance/Baroque/Neoclassical/Romantic/Rococo/Modern/Postmodern
    etc) are much more useful in talking about type history than oldstyle/transitional/modern,
    which I couldn't even define off the top of my head. How \"old\" is oldstyle?
    If we say Renaissance, though, everyone knows when the (Venetian) Renaissance
    was, and what was going on in related arts. The distinctions seem to also be finer
    than the conventional system allows for. Mugford is right, though; Bringhurst's
    terms aren't often used by typographers (or taught in school), at least in my
    experience."

  body: Do you know of any good books that are more about the history of letterforms
    way way back? Like the progression to how we even came to have the forms that
    we have now? (e.g. Egyptian, Greek, ancient letterforms) I am going to buy a couple
    of the books you guys suggested but I am also interested in that sort of history,
    which seems to be more difficult to come by..

    Ouaknin (translated by Josephine Bacon)."

    Alphabetic Labyrinth' by Johanna Drucker, available in paperback ( largesize -
    about 7.5 \" x 10.25\") paperback is also very good.\r\n\r\nA classic history
    of typefaces up to the 1920s is 'Printing Types: Their History, Forms and Use',
    by Daniel Berkely Updike, in 2 volumes. It's a great foundation for a typographical
    library.  It was reprinted by the Harvard U. Press in 1951."
