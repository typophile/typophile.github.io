body: "In a thread too old to reply to, I saw this by Miss Tiffany:\r\n\r\n<cite>What
  do you mean by Garamond is too French to be universal? Is Univers too Swiss to be
  universal too?</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's a good question, and I didn't see a good answer,
  or even the standard answer, in the thread. Hrant did note that he thought of Helvetica
  as a 20th century typeface, not a particularly Swiss one.\r\n\r\nAssuming that a
  truly Swiss typeface is not necessarily a kind of blackletter that goes well with
  cuckoo clocks, though, why is Garamond \"French\" if being originally designed in
  France isn't enough?\r\n\r\nOne school of typographic thought, at least, views Garamond
  as uniquely French and Bodoni as uniquely Italian, and so on, based on those typefaces
  working well with the letter frequency characteristics of their respective languages,
  as well as their having a <em>long</em> history of association with them."

  body: And so Caslon is presumably the quintessentially English typeface, while,
    unfortunately I can't think of the (Roman, not Fraktur) typeface associated with
    German. (Myself, I tend to associate Aldus - which could be called "Palatino Book"
    - with German.)

    some kind \r\nof beefed-up, slightly square-shouldered version of the neoclassical
    template.\r\nAnd don\u2019t forget that our perception of these faces may be tainted
    by what \r\nsome authors (which, in turn, were cited by other authors, and so
    on) wrote \r\nabout them \u2014 like D. B. Updike\u2019s praise of Caslon\u2019s

  body: "<cite> based on those typefaces working well with the letter frequency characteristics
    of their respective languages, as well as their having a long history of association
    with them.</cite>\r\n\r\nI think the first point (type design from a certain country
    goes well with language of that country) is mostly a myth. It is of course true
    that a type designer knows his own language best and probably pays more a attention
    to the local diacritical characters, certain letter combinations and so on. But
    in general: In scripts like Latin you can put any character beside any other character.
    There is nothing French, or Italian, or German about that. A good type design
    should work well in any language and I wouldn\u2019t know that there is anything
    inherent in the general look of Garamond, Bodoni or Walbaum which make them especially
    suitable for one language, but not others. And saying the designs inherit certain
    virtues of a type designer of a certain area in the world where people are said
    to have certain virtues sounds even more far fetched. \r\n\r\nThe second point
    (association) is all that matters in my opinion. It\u2019s not about the typeface
    design itself, but about the context in which they are used. These connotations
    make typefaces British, French and so on. "

  body: "One factor is the frequency of capitalized letters, high in German and low
    in some other languages. A font with a low x-height would seem to work better
    for continuous text set in the latter group. So Germanic as a high x-height font?

    in which the upper-case letters were reduced slightly in stroke width.

    of thick and thin sans fonts compared to the Anglosphere. Also, the loose free-form
    designs Art Nouveau had perhaps wider adoption for French fonts than in most countries.
    The somewhat similar, but not quite as loose,  Jugendstil had influence in Germany
    and Austria, but my impression is that it was not as strong as Art Nouveau in
    France. Anyway, it's difficult to see how much credibility can be given to on
    the fly comments like this. \r\nDon"
