body: Hi, I'm a graphic design student doing a freelance assignment designing a logo
  for a community orchestra. I used Verlag at first, but it is too similar to what
  another music group in town uses, so now I'm looking for a serif font with a similar
  feel. I'd like something cool, contemporary, and clean. Any suggestions? Thanks
  in advance!

  body: "Verlag is yet another design derivative of an older Typeface called Erbar
    (1927 Jacob Erbar-Germany). So is the dutch Nobel and other designs. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    google for typefaces from around that time period, or maybe from the Bauer Type
    Company, which published many of those typefaces back then. Like Bauer Bodony,
    Weiss, Beton (slab), Candida (slab) etc. \r\n\r\nDepending on your taste, I would
    say Weiss is a closer Serif to the sans cut and proportions you're looking for.
    It's also rather beautiful.\r\n\r\ngood luck,\r\nA"

  body: I didn't know about Erbar. I do like Weiss quite a bit. I like Beton too,
    and it has less contrast between thick and thins, which is more what I had in
    mind. Thanks for the help. I'm thinking about these.

    to look for a font similar to Chronicle Text."

  body: I don't think Archer would work, but something similar to Chronicle might
    (unfortunately I can't afford to buy Chronicle right now). I'm also liking Biblon
    from Storm.

  body: "Hah, I see what you're saying about Archer. I really liked the pointy M of
    Verlag, and thought it went well with the symbol I was using. I actually ended
    up using Verlag in a heavier weight for the most emphasized word, and used a slab
    serif for the other two words. I asked a couple of people what they thought and
    they thought the logos looked very different from one another other, so I think
    it was a good choice.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the help."
