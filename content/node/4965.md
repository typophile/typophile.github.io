  <BR>Thomas Phinney wrote <i>Indeed, if the typeface choice doesn&#39;t need to resonate

  typefaces in the world.</i> <BR>Yes indeed. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve found that any <i>typeface
  of worth</i>, like Berthold&#39;s Garamond for example, would serve a detective
  story,  or a historical text just as well as a science fiction novel or <i>pretty
  much anything</i>. <BR> <BR>The trick is to use that one typeface as sensitive and

  That&#39;s what I think a good typographer should do.  <BR>And that has been my
  experience.  <BR> <BR>My comment in the other thread may have sounded severe, but
  please note that this mainly concerns book typography. I have nothing against more
  expressive typography <i>per se</i>. <BR> <BR>And if you have some good examples

  make some exceptions to my rule. <BR> <BR>

  body: I don&#39;t think there is really a dichotomy here. <BR> <BR>I doubt whether
    we do <i>need</i> more than a handful of functional typefaces &#40;for book typography,
    at least&#41;. But the fact is, we <i>have</i> more than a handful. Precisely
    because no one typeface stands head and shoulders above the others on any functional
    grounds &#40;many work pretty well&#41;, we will continue to have a choice. <BR>
    <BR>In these circumstances, to insist on using just one typeface for everything
    is itself a choice. <BR> <BR>Among the many choices a designer makes, choice of
    typeface may well be relatively unimportant. But there is no reason in principle
    why a designer may not use a variety of different typefaces and use them all with
    sensitivity and care. Admittedly, excessive promiscuity may be a bad idea &#40;because
    it often takes a while to get the &#34;hang&#34; of a particular typeface&#41;;
    but within reason choice may be good. If it helps the designer to keep fresh and
    enthusiastic, that may be good too. <BR> <BR>How then to choose? For a whole range
    of reasons. Some technical &#40;lots of information, little space; narrow columns;
    need oldstyle figures or not; need bold or not; need small caps or not&#41;; some
    personal &#40;I like this type, not that&#41;. I see no reason why allusiveness
    and resonance to subject or period <i>should not</i> form part of these considerations,
    if you want them to. <BR> <BR>If there are no such resonances then, at worst,
    those who believe there are will be selecting usable type for the wrong reasons.
    They are deluding themselves in supposing that their careful allusiveness adds
    anything, but it is a harmless delusion. Rot only sets in if it leads to the choice
    of faces which are functionally poor; but I see no reason to suppose, given the
    range of acceptable faces available, why that should happen.

    importance, over all subtler considerations. However, it&#39;s hardly an argument
    to stop making new faces, redundant or not, nor an argument to stop paying attention
    to finer details when circumstances allow. But that&#39;s another discussion.
    <BR> <BR>As for crazy content, I believe I&#39;ve posted about this novel on Typophile
    before, but I&#39;ll bring it up again: Mark Z. Danielewski&#39;s <i><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=AQv1v3Mqi6&amp;isbn=0375703764&amp;itm=1">House
    of Leaves</a></i> is, in my direct experience, a great example of a variety of
    typefaces &#40;most of which are quite common and non-crazy&#41; used in a crazy
    way, along with one more expressive &#40;read as: distressed&#41; typeface used
    for content generated by a character who is literally going crazy. <BR> <BR>The
    effects are not necessary for communication, but really add a lot. I recommend
    checking it out in a bookstore if you have the opportunity. The more standard
    book typesetting leaves something to be desired, but the layout acrobatics required
    to deal with the literally and intentionally labrynthian narrative are impressive
    in their own right. It&#39;s a good example of fine book typography taking a back
    seat to just about every other consideration while not damaging the experience
    too dramatically as a result. The reading experience is so broken up by physical
    and narrative jumps that it becomes quite minor, in fact &#40;not much extended,
    continous reading&#41;. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s hard to explain what I mean without
    the book on hand, but it&#39;s a very interesting special case in book typography.'

  body: 'In the realm of display type, few would doubt that &#34;expression&#34; is
    valuable in a font, which means we can never have enough of them. In the text
    realm there is indeed reason to doubt the usefulness of more than a handful of
    fonts, because immersive reading precludes conscious aesthetic impressions. In
    fact it might seem that the only good reason to make a new text fonts is to solve
    emerging technical issues. <BR> <BR>But when you take into account that the <i>subconscious</i>
    is also open to being &#34;impressed&#34; &#40;albeit in a very different way
    than the consciousness&#41;, you realize that it&#39;s really mostly a matter
    of subtlety, not exclusion, of features. This is why everything has to be toned
    down in a text font: first it has to &#34;go below the radar&#34; of the consciousness,
    for it to have any hope of marking its effect in immersive reading. <BR> <BR>In

    say something and soft coners say something else, no matter that the reader can&#39;t

    a black art. <BR> <BR>So choosing Garamond for a SciFi novel isn&#39;t bad because

    no more expressive than a change between roman and italic to indicate a foreign

    typography that is somehow emotive, that draws on conventional cultural or subcultural

    lies the fatal flaw -- to use your favourite phrase -- in such a programme. Like
    abstract expressionism in painting, the intent of the author or artist to express
    something in his mind falls at the gateway of another&#39;s mind. The fact that
    the author states that the typography is expressive doesn&#39;t make it expressive.
    If it were genuinely expressive, it wouldn&#39;t need to be explained. This is
    why I prefer the term evocative to expressive, because expression implies a thought
    that is being expressed from one person, presumably to another, while evocation
    seeks only to trigger associations that the reader/viewer already has. Language
    remains the only halfway reliable means of expression between two or more minds.

    &#40;a steady progress.&#41; <BR> <BR>The italic though of course was based on
    handwriting, but Griffo seemed to be more interested in how it saved space - technical
    progress. But typographic progress shouldn&#39;t be constrained to technical progress,

    using the same &#34;reliable&#34; type comparable to looking at the same style
    of paintings over and over? Should we be content to keep seeing the same exhibit
    century after century? While most of us I think would agree to use as few typefaces
    as possible in a single book, for a whole country to use a handful of typefaces
    is something different and more extreme.  <BR> <BR>At the same time, with all
    of my ranting for progress, I have to say this..  I have been using Sabon lately
    in semi-lengthy amounts of childrens&#39; book reading, for more than one book.
    Mainly because of its legibility, but also because I want to stay away from ligatures
    and the short f&#39;s look great next to the i&#39;s without using ligatures.
    The more I use it, the harder I think it&#39;s going to be for me to break away
    from it...not because of stubborness, but because I feel like I am learning how
    to really use it, and I appreciate something different each time..Which might
    seem anti-progress, since I&#39;ve been looking at the same painting for the last
    few books.. ha. At the same time, I&#39;m always looking out for something that
    might convey my message better.. either through functionality or...By the way,
    are there any other types of progress that I&#39;m missing out? Communication,
    cultural.. functional/technical... ? <BR> <BR>So perhaps, progress is just as
    important in the designer as it is in the typeface. &#40;Ah.. okay. So I think,
    then, Fredrik, that you are saying &#34;more so&#34;.&#41; ? And if a designer&#39;s
    progress is more important to the reader than typographic progress.. the two should
    work more closely together than the current process of: type designer makes it
    in one country and designer buys it and uses it in another. I personally think
    the relationships need to be tighter, but designing brochures is faster than designing
    a typeface, so the two will probably never meet up perfectly. But it&#39;s so
    important for designers to have a good knowledge of type. I think I have more
    favorite type designers than I have graphic designers.. hmm..  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    seeing both sides, but there&#39;s a side effect to not caring if a typeface sheds
    light onto a text. It&#39;s the whole.. not caring. Good design comes in part
    from having layers of meaning. The page proportions, paper selection, cover design,
    choice of typeface, etc. can affect the atmosphere of the book and help tell the
    story. Why would you want to pass up this opportunity? &#40;Besides time and money!&#41;  <BR>

    <BR>That&#39;s much too utilitarian. Here&#39;s another way of looking at it:
    <BR> <BR>Poggio invented the humanist script c.1400. It has been described by

    style that Jenson&#39;s definitive Roman face interprets. <BR> <BR>During the
    Incunabula, in the later 1400s, the work of the Italian writing masters &#40;eg

    of the manuscript hand, itself a reaction to the plainness of the original Roman

    it for anything, provided you use it carefully. He was sceptical about ideas of
    &#34;congeniality&#34; between a particular typeface and a particular text. All
    of this is entirely agnostic between old and new faces. He did not say that old
    faces are of more &#34;worth&#34; than new ones, or vice versa. <BR> <BR>&#40;Incidentally,
