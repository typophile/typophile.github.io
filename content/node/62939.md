  body: The M-y connection looks wrong. i would edit it to come up from underneath
    and join at an angle, not a rounded curve. then the letters could be moved a smidge
    closer. What do you think?

    works.\r\nUnfortunately, I'm not a script expert, but given the drawing, I would
    look for a low contrast script, if not monoline. In order to match the strokes
    of the type to those of the decoration."

  body: "riccard0\r\n\r\nthanks! Good idea I see what you mean by a monoline that
    would be better and would be a good font to own since most of my illustrations
    are in this style.\r\n\r\nAnyone have a suggestion for a nice, not terribly expensive
    monoline script? I need a very pretty one...I have Coquette, I don't like handsome...I
    need something that is very special and goes with my illustration style."

    other suggestions? Most of my clients like a very sophisticated/elegant typeface
    (royal) like Edwardian script  OR Mrs Eaves so I need to find a balance between
    my illustration style and what they want out of a typeface...any other suggestions?
    I like this, but I worry that they will feel it is too child-like. I need something
    that feel adult and rich."

  body: "Hmm I know you are trying to help me, and I really appreciate it...\r\n..but
    I think i really need something with all the swashes and swoops of Edwardian script,
    but maybe just no thick and thins? Is there a monoline or almost monoline font
    that is otherwise fancy? It needs to feel sort of 1800s and/or victorian like
    the illustration does... ornate and decorative and feminine...like a sketch for
    a victorian illustration.\r\n\r\nIf I didn't think I would have to use it over
    and over I might just edit the Edwardian to be a monoline, but that is not practical
    for many pieces over time."

    have to edit away a few of the swirls on the caps because they are over the top,
    but the way the letters are drawn and connect feels like my drawings and not at
    all childish...more just fresh and yet formal... I like the way there is a loop
    where the lowercase letters connect. thanks for all your help!"
