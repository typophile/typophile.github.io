		<div class="commentbody"><p>Miraculously after working all day between the Learn Fontlab Fast, Adam Twardoch&rsquo;s MSN Group Naming Thread, and Karsten&rsquo;s Font naming pdf (All which have slightly different methods to this mysterious process &ndash; and having no prior problems with font families less than six styles) I&rsquo;ve managed to export my OpenType font family and have it preview with all but the &lsquo;Light&rsquo; weight missing in the sub-menu (CS).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m to the point I&rsquo;d be willing to pay and/or hire someone briefly to look at my .vfb files of all six styles to give me some insight into what might be wrong with the current naming conventions I&rsquo;m using.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious as to what the magic key is to successfully generate a PS OpenType font family consisting of six styles is. (And have them ALL actually show up in the sub-menu)</p>
<p>I apologize for my lack of expertise with this, it is a problem I just ran into recently and due to the constrains of time and my focus on creative work I haven&rsquo;t had the opportunity to focus as much on coding or software engineering literature in order to increase my competence in some of the advanced subject&rsquo;s within Fontlab. (Such as simply trying to name a font family of six styles and have it actually work).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Infuriating, isn&rsquo;t it? This topic is probably one of the more challenging things facing font developers, apart from the actual design part. I would say, &ldquo;something needs to be done&rdquo; but I fear that might result in another half-dozen name table fields that need to get added to fonts.</p>
<p>Anyway: I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve seen Thomas Phinney&rsquo;s bit on this which includes some screen captures for FontLab settings: <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/Font%20names.pdf">http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/Font%20names.pdf</a>   &hellip; it might help but don&rsquo;t be surprised if there are still some oddities in some application somewhere.</p>
<p>Also: under Mac OS X you may find it helpful to delete your font caches and reboot. In fact that may be the problem, especially if you&rsquo;ve been installing and uninstalling your fonts as you work on them. The FontNuke app at <a href="http://www.jamapi.com/">http://www.jamapi.com/</a> is useful for this.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Joshua,</p>
<p>Thanks for the heads up, I just tried FontNuke, restarted and now all six styles show up properly. Up until now I had always relied on Font Explorer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Clean application font caches…&rsquo; to quickly make changes/edits and re-install a freshly &lsquo;generated&rsquo; type family.</p>
<p>Now it makes me wonder how many times I had the font naming conventions correct earlier only to have it possibly be a cache issue?</p>
<p>This is an interesting topic, if anyone has any insight into these issues, and or their own process for naming-testing-clearing-reinstalling let us know.</p>
<p>Thanks…</p>

<p>The magic is, <strong>use the AFDKO !</strong> At this point I probably sound like a broken record, but I still haven&rsquo;t seen a tool that does the [[Font Naming]] correct and effortlessly like the [[AFDKO]] does. And if you find this hard to believe, ask the [[Education|Type &amp; Media]] or the [[Education|Reading]] students. I was over there a couple of months ago giving a workshop on how to use the AFDKO tools, and we probably spent like 10 minutes(!!) setting up the naming. And half of that time was actually just typing.</p>
<p>Are you planning to attend [[TypeCon]] this year? I&rsquo;m going to give a full-day workshop there about using some of the AFDKO tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This topic is probably one of the more challenging things facing font developers</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I completely agree. Getting the &lsquo;name&rsquo; table right is not an easy task. Fortunately there are (free) tools out there that simplify the whole process. Have I mentioned the [[AFDKO]]? :) I just don&rsquo;t understand why FontLab hasn&rsquo;t taken advantage of this yet&hellip;</p>

<p>Regarding Miguel&rsquo;s link to his post in the other thread: 
To understand the relation of MakeOTF&rsquo;s FontMenuNameDB to FLS5&rsquo;s naming interface, just bear in mind that MakeOTF&rsquo;s &ldquo;FamilyName&rdquo;/&ldquo;StyleName&rdquo; roughly matches FLS5&rsquo;s &ldquo;OT Family Name&rdquo;/&ldquo;OT Style Name&rdquo; (&ldquo;long family&rdquo; in Adam Twardoch&rsquo;s naming how-to), while MakeOTF&rsquo;s &ldquo;WindowsCompatibleMenuName&rdquo; matches FLS5&rsquo;s &ldquo;Family Name&rdquo; (&ldquo;short family&rdquo;).
This equation is not absolutely true, but may help get the idea.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t trust in everything you see on those two panes. When opening a non-VFB font, FontLab fills in some fields with values that were not present in the font. If you want to analyze the contents of the &lsquo;name&rsquo; table, you should look at the 3rd pane (Additional OpenType names/Non-English or special font names: [name] table), or use tools like ttx, tx, spot, all available in the AFDKO.</p>

<p><em>how does AFDKO effect what would already be in your Fontlab files in the naming info sections if they are already filled out? </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The workflow we use for generating the OTFs (described here [[http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/TypoTechnica2007_FontProduction_at_Adobe.pdf|Font Production at Adobe]]) involves generating a Type 1 font (.pfa) from the VFB. That font will only contain certain values from the fields on FontLab&rsquo;s Font Info panes. In terms of naming, you just need to worry about these fields: Family Name, Weight, PS Font Name and Full Name. These need to match the information you put on the FontMenuNameDB file. This file is used for building the &lsquo;name&rsquo; table, whereas the names you type in FontLab go into the &lsquo;CFF ' table.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other Font Info data that goes into the Type 1 font, like the Copyright, the Notice, the Version number, the Italic angle, the Hinting, etc., but these don&rsquo;t affect the naming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>And what about the weight input such as Regular - 400, and in situations where you need to manually correct ExtraLight, to make it 250 instead of 200?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those values don&rsquo;t end up in the Type 1 font. That data is put in the &lsquo;features&rsquo; file, in the form of a table declaration,
<code>
table OS/2 {
   CapHeight 650;
   XHeight 440;
   TypoAscender 709;	# top of ascenders
   TypoDescender -291;	# TypoAscender-UPM
   TypoLineGap 200;	# 20% of UPM
   WeightClass 400;	# Normal (Regular)
   WidthClass 5;		# Medium (Normal)
   Vendor &ldquo;ADBE&rdquo;;
   FSType 8;			# Editable embedding
   Panose 2 4 5 3 5 2 1 2 2 3;
} OS/2;

<p>Should the Additional OpenType names panel always be filled in. I think like Goran I have been opening fonts in FL to try and work out there naming and noticed that panel empty. 
If you say FL fills in values that are not present in the font, does it also leave the Additional OpenType names panel empty when in the original VFB for that font it would have been completed.</p>

<p>Yes, but I get kind of lost within the terminal application, it&rsquo;s bizarre to be working with an application that is a text window running commands. If I saw a live example I think I would have a better understanding and the ability to get through it.</p>

<p>Yes, that would be great, I briefly had that thought when I was looking at how complex AFDKO seems to be (coming from the more creative side of things as opposed to programming). Making it to TypeCon would be great but a videocast would be really helpful in the meantime. Thanks Miguel…</p>

<p>Yes, it is on CS3 apps, although I&rsquo;m positive the weight values are correct, in a descending order from lightest to heaviest as I&rsquo;m very careful with these details after having gone over and over them.</p>
<p>What is interesting, is, shortly after trying the Fontshop naming convention, I went back in for further testing and re-named all styles similar to (A Twardoch&rsquo;s naming how-to and kl&rsquo;s), yet I eliminated the &lsquo;Menu Name&rsquo;, &lsquo;FOND Name&rsquo;, and on the next page, &lsquo;Mac Name&rsquo; was left blank as well.</p>
<p>I then re-generated the &lsquo;Additional OpenType Name&rsquo; panel for each and the generated font family worked excellent, with the sub-menu styles in order from lightest to heaviest (and all styles showing up in the sub-menu correctly).</p>
<p>In a way, I&rsquo;ve come full circle with this issue, coming to understand what fields are most important and what role they play. As of now, I plan to sticking to the convention I just mentioned as it seems to work best, and it splits the 6 styles into 2 sub families for MS. 
The ExtraLight and Light styles have the &lsquo;Family Name&rsquo; of Myfont Lt and the other four weights the family name of Myfont Rg and every other field is consistent within this family.</p>

<p>I kind of like this, as a matter of fact, because it force the user to actively chose the right weight manually, and by that there will be no confusion what so ever.</p>
