    is an other part of this logotype It would be interesting to see all to suggest
    something. If your question is only to have choices of script typeface, you can
    make a research on Fontshop for example. Here some <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/category/script/\">script
    typefaces</a>.\r\n\r\n[edit]"

    is similar, but more casual and contemporary.

    body: "I like it but the client doesn't.  Actually this is already a very tweaked
      version of carpenter. The client originally found it to be too illegible. It
      may still be true since both comments thought that the logo said \"heaven\"
      and it actually says \"haven.\" \r\n\r\nThanks for the Liorah suggestion, that
      may be just the ticket. "
