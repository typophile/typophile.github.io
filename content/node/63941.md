  body: "I believe this is [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/sofiascript.shtml|Sofia
    Script]] that has been customized. The A seems too close for coincidence and the
    overall feel is almost identical, even if some of the letter details aren't. The
    L might almost be an upside down I from this font. Some of the lower case letters,
    like the n, look very close; others don't, so I am not sure of this ID, but I
    think it would at least be a very similar font.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I found the right answer. It is also from Letterhead fonts, but it is Stanford
    Script, by the same designer (Chuck Davis). It even has the badly kerned L. See
    the sample below from the Script Font ID Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StanfordScrLHF_4068.gif]"

  body: Thanks for the ID! I'm still on the fence on whether or not I like this font.
    It feels raw and messy, yet there is an elegance also. Thanks again.
