  asked about previously at WhatTheFont yet it remains unsolved.\r\n\r\nI'd thus appreciate
  your help in identifying it, please, anyone who knows which it is?... \r\n\r\nIt
  reminds of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/flux/\">Flux</a> but the endings
  in some of the letters are rather different (and also it appears to be somewhat
  \"boldier\" than the bold version itself) so I don't know?... Is it another font
  all along? (Or would it maybe just be a \"customly edited\" Flux?...) \r\n\r\nThanks
  already, once more, for your help and patience.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/totobola_3499.jpg]"
