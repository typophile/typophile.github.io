body: "What should the 'Cap Height' be on an Ethiopic Glyph? I recognize that putting
  it that way prejudices the question to some extent especially as there is no lower
  case in Ethiopic forms and it doesn't make sense to force Ethiopic to be Latin-like.
  However the idea here is to have a font which works well with common sans fonts
  like Arial. In fact this font will probably be styled somewhere between traiditional
  ge'ez & arial/frutiger/helvetica. In the 1st case we have a height of 616 ( 1000
  upm) and in the second we have 716, (the height of caps in Arial). Personally I
  am favoring the 716. However, the thick thin variation in 616 seems to be a good
  thing. Please note- The forms themselves are a work in progress as is the spacing.
  I should also note that this project is not mine. I can't claim the credit. I am
  just helping out. Examples:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/616_6587.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/717_4942.gif]\r\n\r\nBonus
  question: Does the greater complexity of ethopic forms as well as their small size
  as compared to Latin forms mean that spacing needs to be more generous? I am guessing
  that the answer is yes. Chinese glyphs for example need greater spacing to read
  well than Latin ones. What do you think?"

  body: I was looking for a sample of that online ( no vista here just yet... ). But
    I did not find any samples. Can you point to one or take a screen shot? Do you
    recall what choice he made about the vertical height?

    intuition is that the greater complexity of the glyphs calls for a bit more spacing
    than, say, all-caps Arial, but less than in the examples posted - there's so much
    white space that it no longers gives the eye a clue. But I think mainly you should
    pay attention to what sort of spacing the readers expect from proper typography."

  body: "On the other hand, if the height vary & the notan or color ( Bill that's
    for you ) is resultingly more balanced then the spacing can afford to be more
    Latinesqe. And looking at old examples - thats the model that is traditional too.\r\n\r\nWhat
    made me wonder about more spacing is that Ato's current vertical Height is semi-regularized
    (see above) and is creating a greater density and a more varying density than
    we usually have in latin forms and which I associate with complex chinese glyphs.
    Hence the idea.\r\n\r\nI imagine you could skin the cat that different way: you
    could treat the glyphs a la the chinese brush to get better notan. That would
    mean varying the thickness of the strokes and other kinds of notanic compensation
    that we find in Chinese forms. But I don't think that the best route for Ato.
    I think the more traditional varying of height makes the most sense especially
    since he is going to be making a sans Ethiopic face which is perhaps enough of
    a departure from tradition to start with! \r\n\r\nAlso, Ato is concerned with
    screen rendering which is another reason to varry the heights rather than go with
    the more compressed 'chinese/latin' model. Varying the heights will allow the
    salient features of the glyphs to remain larger since they are not being compressed
    to fit a latin cap height at all and so they will be easier to represent in pixels
    at smaller pt/em sizes.\r\n\r\n Moreover Ato's intention is to make a face that
    mixes well with sans faces such as Arial at the low end & Frutiger at the high.
    Yet another reason to consider John's Nyala model seriously.\r\n\r\nDo you see
    what I mean? Do you have any counter arguements?"
