  font. The closest font i own that matches it is FF Netto, so i wondered if anyone
  happens to know what this one actually is.\r\n\r\nYou can find the font and the
  site on the link below (the font is used throughout, for titles etc);\r\n\r\nhttp://wonder-wall.com/"

    but is again, not an exact match (the 'o' is too narrow)...\r\nanyone else having
    any luck?"

    is not DIN. But I don't know, too. Some letters remind me as if someone wanted
    to create a \xBBsharp\xAB version of Nick Cookes Chevin. ;)"

    attempted to pull the font information out of the SWF file but they use a 'loader.swf'
    file that's over my head."

    Condensed</a> from Process is pretty close. The bold u/c WONDERWALL in particular.

  body: "Yeah, i checked Bryant Condensed and Compressed, they are quite close, their
    'bold' versions almost need to be a bit stronger.\r\nThis font has got me stumped.
    thanks to everyone so far for looking into it. I'm refusing to give up."

  body: "After an extensive search yesterday I'm starting to think this one might
    be custom. Bryant Condensed and PF DIN are close in overall weight and feel but
    each is missing critical details.\r\n\r\nIf someone knows ActionScript and can
    figure out the path names that the 'loader.swf' file uses to retrieve each page
    it shouldn't be difficult to get the font information."

    a clue how to go about finding it out through a flash file, far too technical
    for me."

  body: That makes sense, I guess. It really does look like DIN; just not a version
    of DIN I've previously been familiar with. Nice one.

  body: Christian Robertson's [[http://betatype.com/node/36|Ubuntu Titling Font]]
    would make a nice alternative for the bolder weights.
