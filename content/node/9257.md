body: Hi Typophiles, <BR> <BR>Is there any way alternative to sue, to get any responses
  from a foundry who fail on an agreement, i mean, a kind of organization related
  to software/type ethic or legal? <BR> <BR>I have a depression/frustration of 5 months
  without email responses or payments, and i am far from the country/state of the
  governed laws, so its hard to think about a legal way of help &#34;in situ&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>Any help is very important for me; sorry to the foundry to make this problem
  public, but 5 months forced me to find any chance of solution, <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>

  body: The only thing that&#39;s worked for me &#40;and not exceptionally well&#41;
    is applying pressure via mutual acquaintances. Strictly a socio-moral angle, bypassing
    the legal crap that&#39;s meant to protect the rich - but I&#39;m an old-fashioned
    kinda guy. <BR> <BR>One thing though, be careful of the libel angle, if you make
    accusations that you can&#39;t prove in court - in case your adversary is that
    kind of person &#40;but I don&#39;t think he is :-&#41;. The good news in this
    case is that you&#39;re not in the US. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Well, I don&#39;t know what your situation is, but TypeRight &#40;from their
    rhetoric, at least&#41; might be able to help. <BR> <BR>Also, if you and the other
    party are members of the ATypI, I believe that they still have an arbitration
    unit, which could handle your situation as well. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, whatever
    your situation is, a lawsuit is probably out of the question. In order to do that,
    you&#39;d have to hire a lawyer in the respective foreign country, and pay the
    requisite legal fees <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: Thank you typophiles; here is a small part of the contract.. <BR> <BR>3. TIMING
    OF PAYMENTS. Payments due to the Publisher will be paid on the first business
    day after the 20th day of the month following the month of sale. All payments
    will be made in US dollars and mailed via first class mail. In the event that
    XX is more than 30 days behind the payments under this agreement, Publisher shall
    have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by giving XX written or
    electronic notice of such termination. In such event, the license granted XX shall
    terminate as of the date of such notice. <BR> <BR>The only unfair thing that make
    me ungry is that this XX foundry is still making money form my work. A lawsuit
    is an imposible thing to do for me actually, and i am not interesed on fight with
    a situation like this, probably will be a waste of time, because it will be a
    money stuff. I am only a little confused about what to do now following the contract;
    i never tought that this will happen to me and maybe the better thing is to quit
    from the XX foundry as soon as posible via email &#40;...and wait another 5 months..&#41;
    and make my own e-commerce type place.  <BR> <BR>Thank for your feedback. <BR>
    <BR>Best <BR> <BR>mh

  body: It would seem that by not terminating earlier you&#39;ve given these guys
    several months to exploit your work and keep 100% of the proceeds.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    suggest you send the termination letter, and take your fonts elsewhere.  <BR>
    <BR>I think the only leverage you have in getting the back-royalties would be
    the threat of publicizing the way you&#39;ve been treated. But I&#39;d certainly
    suggest you consult with a lawyer before doing that.  <BR> <BR>Si

  body: If you can terminate your contract, I would do that, I think, if I were in
    your shoes. But then I would turn around and find a foundry that will uphold their
    end of the contract, add some alternates or some other value add to your fonts
    and start pounding the market with the fact that these are better versions. Is
    this possible Miguel?

    Foundry contact me today &#40;what a coincidence..&#41;, once this post in online...Its
    a shame.  <BR> <BR>I will never be enough thankful with typophile as a place of
    help because of the empathy.  <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your feedback, guys. <BR>
    <BR>I will &#34;finally&#34; &#40;i hope&#41; terminate the contract today. I
    really apreciate the fact that moderators don
