  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everyone, how are you doing.  ive been going in circles for the past week.  i have been up reading articles and doing tutorials.  im always on here reading articles and different stuff but i freelance for different ppl here and there.  but i so get confused when its a family member.  my husband now is in the flooring business so he wants a cool logo and nice type. he is gonna sell ceramic, wood, carpet and tile.  so he didnt want the carpet roll basic theme.  i dont know if i get nervous or what, but literally i did about 10 logos and i still think they look like crap.  so the name is called flooring 4 you. i wanted to intertwine the letters but that didnt go to well either.  i can not find the perfect type and i cant link the words togather,  he chose the colors teracotta and green.  and im just trying to figure out where to go from here.  can you please critique me and give me some guidelines to let me go on my way so i can achieve what i need.  lol i dont know im just so lost.

Work in black and white if possibble and then add the color in the last.
Logo is like an unique word. It should be very simple so that people can remember.</p>
<p>You should also have a look at the logos of few existing companies who do same kind of business.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think 2 and 3 have the most potential to develop although both need tweaking and tidying up, as Satya recommends start simply with black and white, the graduation which includes both colours probably won’t work too well out of four colour where the brown meets the green will reproduce as a muddy shade. The name works against a ‘cool’ type treatment, but the type for 2 is not doing it at all for me the x-height and baseline are bouncing around too much and is much too tightly kerned.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">thank you so much for your feedback.  greatly appreciate it.  i am going todo some more examples.  i seen and looked at alot of carpet logos and they are all different.  some have serifs and some dont.   some are all caps and some are both serif and san serif.  im just confused with the whole process.  i took a typography class in school and it was great and even got some books on typography, but i guess some people just get it and people like me, need to keep on focusing.  thank you again</div>

<p>Practice, practice and practice – everybody needs it to gan confidence, books can help but trying things out for yourself and asking for critiques is the good way to learn, try the critique forum, just remembered another <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/29413">flooring company logo</a>.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You might also want to rethink if a symbol is really needed.</p>
<p>Flooring For You (and perhaps not Flooring4U) is quite expressive as a name. Possibly all you need to do is set it in some really nice serif typeface. If you think that&rsquo;s too plain maybe you could introduce a sort of underline as a visual pun for flooring.</p>
<p>This underline could be rendered in different patterns and textures drawn from various flooring material. So the logo would be slightly different from one application to another. Could be fun!</p>
<p>Of the existing options, 3 does seem to be the one with most potential. It may be an idea not to have the name within the diamond form. It might be quite hard to read in smaller sizes. And by the way why not make an &lsquo;F&rsquo; out of the three words?</p>
<p>As Tim correctly puts it, the only way is to keep working at it. And again as he says, get another person&rsquo;s perspective every once in a while.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
