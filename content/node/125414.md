body: "I'm rebuilding a logotype that uses this sans serif that looks a lot like futura
  but differs in some subtle ways:\r\n\r\n* The lower case s upper and lower hooks
  flow in a more symmetric way and is a bit narrower.\r\n* The lower case acute accent
  on the letter i is different in shape with horizontal top and bottom terminations.\r\n*
  Round letters are a little bit wider.\r\n* The counter of the lower case a and p
  push very deep into the stem.\r\n\r\nI have Linotype's, Adobe's and Bitstream's
  and they don't look like this. I also googled Futura ND and it doesn't match either.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n"
