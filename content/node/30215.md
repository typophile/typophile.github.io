  on some political design work that's making the rounds here in DC.\r\n\r\nThe NRA
  is producing, and has leaked, a new fund-raising booklet that's exploding with gorgeous
  illustration and some fine design, especially for a political piece, you can snag
  the whole thing in a pdf <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/images/NR-F8_PERILFINAL.pdf\">here</a>.
  I think that in terms of lobbying design, this is one of the best campaigns I've
  seen in years, although it's not as nice as the <a href=\"http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_acc/index.asp\">American
  Chemistry Council's</a> poster campaign this year which treated DC commuters to
  massive Helvetica on subway station banners. What do you think\u2014is this pretty
  impressive for a political piece or what?"

    activista), but even Dick Cheney could hit with his shotgun the space between
    the words in that justified text.

    is pretty weak especially in contrast with the illustration & design which is

    here and there, but the woodcut-inspired illustrations are very, very nice. As
    is the choice of the colors.

    will make choices out of fear rather than with something radical, like logic.
    It''s kind of hard to take seriously. Maybe Rick Santorum can jerk off to it now

  body: I appreciate the comments. Also, I realize that the design isn't spectacular,
    but I'm looking at it in terms of American political stuff, where everything is
    generally red, white and blue with Bodoni display type and some TNR/Arial sprinkled
    on top. Between last year's American Chemistry Campaign, Tom Vilsack's logo/materials,
    and This I'm starting to wonder if lobbyists with money have finally decided to
    start spending more on design, which would do wonders for design salaries here
    in Washington :)

    I think we all know how far stuff like this can go if taken to the ultimate extreme.

    wrest and recover her opened, non-threatening pearl-handled revolver.\r\n\r\nIdea:
    When disaster triggers collapse of society, all that stands between your family\u2019s
    security and chaotic crime is a firearm.\r\nConcept: Night scene of a horrifically
    ravaged middle-class neighborhood \u2013 by hurricane or tornado or riots or terrorist
    act \u2013 abandoned by police and left powerless against violent mayhem by roving
    gangs. A lone father stands guard over his home, wife and children with a shotgun.\r\n\r\nIdea:

    and the reader must act now.\r\nConcept: Iconic evil non-American figure with
    blazing torch seeks to overpower and set fire to American flag defended by iconic
    American muscular warrior. Good guy has death grip on bad guy\u2019s throat and
    on the torch, which has already caused the flag to smolder. The balance of power
