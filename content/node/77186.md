  body: "Thanks.\r\n@Nick: In most of my script fonts I will include some endings
    that just taper off. It's sort of a remnant of calligraphy. It seems more natural
    to leave an occasional disconnect. Just like you would lift a brush or pen to
    cross a \"t\" or dot an \"i\". I do this between letters in places that would
    seem natural to my own writing. "

    does look more natural and livelier \u2013 a lot of script fonts with more \xBBhomogeneous\xAB/\xBBlogical\xAB
    connections tend to generate a certain monotony in longer texts.\r\nIts liveliness
    enhances readability, it feels very good to the eye."
