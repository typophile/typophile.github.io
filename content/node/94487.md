  embedding theme for what concerns a website made in html, Javascript ecc.\r\n\r\nObviously
  there are now diverse font services as \u201Eweb type\u201C (www.webtype.com) to
  give only an example.\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019d like to do is to embed my own font reliable
  into my homepage hosting it for myself on my server.\r\nIs this possible and if
  yes, how is it to be done exactly.\r\n\r\nI am not interested in giving the user
  browser various font alternatives to use, I know how this works.\r\nI want my font
  to be seen and none else.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible to do so via alien servers it
  has to be possible storing the font data by oneselves.\r\nOr am I wrong here?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your comments and ideas.\r\nScript excerpts are obviously welcome!\r\n\r\nSalutes\r\nStefan"

  body: "Wow,\r\n\r\nthanks a lot for your quick answers!\r\n\r\nVery interesting\r\n\r\n@Jens\r\nAs
    I understood (I have read this also elsewhere) one has to generate a .woff file
    of ones own font.\r\nI checked the options in FontLab and couldn\u2019t find it,
    yet.\r\nBut I will study this guide more carefully.\r\n\r\n@riccard0\r\n\r\nah,
    this seems to be pretty cool, also i doubt to understand it well.\r\nIn fact it
    would not be a font \u201Edownload\u201C but an \u201Eupload\u201C of the font
    designed by oneself and they make it ready for the net? Do I understand this right?\r\nI
    have to study this also carefully.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the help so long!\r\n\r\nStefan\r\n"

    of files and code snippets which will allow you to use it on your webpages. "

      only .ttf fonts are possible to upload.\r\nYet, this is no problem, at all.\r\n\r\nVery,
      very, very cool.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot, Riccardo!\r\nAnd also Jens for the useful
      and clear structured pdf.\r\n\r\nSo, now I only have to finish my font, mainly
      bettering its hinting ;-)\r\nand then start using it.\r\n\r\nGood to have you
      guys\r\n\r\nStefan"
