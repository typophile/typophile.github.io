  annoyingly the hyphen doesn't show up in flash and linotype explorer. It was mapped
  to the wrong character code, I have fixed that but it still doesn't show up.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  experienced this before? any pointers...I'm at the end of my tether!\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nChris\r\n\r\n"
