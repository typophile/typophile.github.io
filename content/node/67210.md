  bugging me:\r\n\r\nI want to use this quotation from Paul Standard in my dissertation,
  but can't find any kind of source or citation for it anywhere.\r\n\r\n\u2018Geometry
  can produce legible letter but art alone makes them beautiful. Art begins where
  geometry ends, and imparts to letters a character transcending mere measurement\u2019.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know where or when he originally said this? Or even any publications that cite this
  quote? Any help gretaly appreciated, thanks."
