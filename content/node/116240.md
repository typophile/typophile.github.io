body: I thought the campaign font at first was neutraface but then when I examined
  the E and A I noticed it was not neutraface. Does anyone have an idea what font
  this is?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled_3677.png]

  body: Don't mean to sound contradictory but to me, it looks definitely to [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface2|Neutraface
    No.2]] and Text Bold to be precise.
