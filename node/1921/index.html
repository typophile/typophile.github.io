<div class=commentbody>LOL!!! Very funny stuff. One of my favourites is still FFDIN, can't beat that for a weird kinda strange german invisibility. <br> <br>Meta Hair/Thin/Light made me remember why I fell in love with that typeface in the 80s. <br> <br>Taz III is a beaut, but I still don't find the right kind of job for this typeface (just need a legit excuse to buy it :-)) <br> <br>Apropos Luc... his VolkswagenOSF is marvelous fun. Just not really something I'm allowed to use... but one of the cleanest Futura-remixes I know. His OSF are making this overused and exploited old face work for me again... <br> <br>Other than that I'm back with very plain serif typefaces in the OTF pro version, like Caslon , Garamond, Warnock... almost an entirely new kind of ballgame with the Open Type features. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>There's another way to see Luxury, and others who license <br>type regularly, might see it this way, too. <br> <br>I view Luxury essentially as Custom Type. <br>There's the feeling that nobody else has it. <br> <br>Is $1500 a ripoff for a logo?

<div class=commentbody>Chris, I think I read somewhere that no one has yet purchased Luxury, because everyone seems to think it's an elaborate joke (it's not). I agree with BJ, though: the high price alone gives it the exclusivity one would associate with "luxury" -- so it is kind of a postmodern joke after all, in addition to being (IMO) a valid price for some nice design. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Luxury is a funny concept, and it is aptly priced for what it stands for. But for me, generally speaking, I would be more inclined to pay more money for a well-made text typeface that I know I'm going to use a lot than an expensive display type. Text faces take more skill and time to make and refine.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Keith, maybe I am thinking the wrong way about this, but it seems to me only fashion advertisers will want to use 'Luxury', and they will have the money and want the exclusivity. <br> <br>But with Trinite, an amazing text face, the whole world might want it, like Times New Roman. By the way, Lexicon, which TEFF compares to Times New Roman as far as versatility, and which Tiffany wants, is also priced similarly in the stratosphere. <br> <br>If TEFF could sell thousands more of Lexicon or Trinite by lowering the price, it would make sense to do so. (Of course I don't actually know the 'price elasticity,' as the economists put it, for these typefaces.) For 'Luxury,' as a display face with a wonderful but very limited appeal, you're not going to sell thousands anyway. <br> <br>The rational basis for pricing is not the work that goes into it, but what will gross the most for the product given the market. Of course that might influence your willingness to do the work in the first place... </div>

<div class=commentbody>William, I think in reality more people would be tempted to buy Luxury regardless of how expensive it is for its exclusivity as an advertising display face (which ironically would make it inexclusive in the long run!). More people are willing to pay for display faces but not 'invisible' text faces. Lexicon is a great typeface, but how many (graphic) designers know or even care about that? For them Lexicon or Trinit</div>

<div class=commentbody>But BJ, the point is that Luxury is <i>not</i> a custom typeface and the price tag doesn't guarantee exclusivity. <br> <br>I think the pricing puts Luxury in a kind of no man's land. You can't afford to buy it for a one-time use. But it's not the kind of face you'd use over and over again. You should'nt want to anyway. <br> <br>And clients who can afford it will think twice about spending so much on a retail face. They might even be willing to pay slightly more to get a customised face. <br> <br>Btw, does anyone have any idea how much a customised face would cost? The LTA one by <a href=http://www.hubertjocham.de/ target=_blank>Hubert Jocham</a> for instance. Really curious. <br> <br>Also, What are the factors that affect the pricing of a custom face?</div>

<div class=commentbody>>ask for printed specimens <br> <br>I did, and they sent samples. And the note in PMN's elegant hand was great! The Lexicon example was a newspaper in Dutch, which makes it hard for me to judge. The Lexicon seemed to me too black, but I might have a different opinion if I could read it. <br> <br>Trinite has so many versions (three different extender heights, two widths, et al.), that it would really take more settings of the different sizes to get a concept. The text setting I was sent - a setting in the tallest and widest version - was beautiful, but this is probably not the most practical size for book text. A lengthy PDF with different settings of the variations in a language I could read would be of great help in judging. But honestly, the price is prohibitive in any case. <br> <br>Given what you and Hrant say about the scarcity of their stuff here, I wonder if they have they (and DTL) have priced themselves out of the US market. They may be geniuses in marketing as they are in type design, but it doesn't look that way from where I sit. <br> <br>Oh, I read on Typographica that a book on Bram de Does has just come out, so maybe I can get that or access to it eventually. </div>

<div class=commentbody>It's not guranteed but implied, isn't it?, given normal <br>prices, market conditions, etc. Okay maybe not, but any <br>logical person about to fork over $1500 is going to ask the <br>typographer where the face has been distributed *before* <br>they buy...wouldn't they? <br> <br>--- <br> <br>the cost of a custom face depends on lots of different factors, <br>most notably the time it takes to complete and <br>how much value that typographer places on time. <br>$2,000 to $10,000 might be a ballpark range. <br> <br>There are a handful of typophiles here who could give you <br>more precise numbers. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>i guess the words 'ripoff' and 'sucker' bothered me. <br>If someone or some company spends $1500 for a typeface <br>then: <br>1) type is important to them in the whole scheme of things. <br>2) they would have a pretty defined sense of how they were <br>going to use the typeface and how the typeface <br>was going to help them. <br>3) they would only feel ripped off, imo, if the type performed <br>like a loose bicycle or if it was being used *everywhere*. <br>4) Christian explained at typographi.ca the care <br>he takes with his retail releases and clearly the $1500 <br>font market is tiny. <br> <br>thus, I can't see any justification for 'sucker' and 'ripoff'... <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with BJ. Aldo I think got a logo worth more than $1,500 to them with just this face. <br> <br>By the way, if you click on my link to Aldo above, the flash animation sometimes ends with the girl holding the boot. Now imagine this (boot bigger, girl smaller) thirty feet tall with the logo 15 feet high, thirty feet wide, all against a bright white background. Wow. And a lot of the wow is the logo. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey, if someone wants to pay for a custom typeface, let them...but to buy just 3 piddly little faces that will probably only be used a handful of times for 1500 bucks is ridiculous. Especially since they're just mimicing the look of other "high class" faces. <br> <br>Search through the catalogue of any major foundery and you can probably find something similar, and better for a fraction of the price.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Christian, you are a greater genius than I previously thought. <br> <br>Here I thought, there's some guy just trying to get under peoples' collars by picking on you. I was all about to post a long reply with a link to your website to show that anyone who actually bothered to read it would know that your typefaces aren't "piddly." <br> <br><a href=http://www.orangeitalic.com/fonts/luxury.shtml target=_blank>http://www.orangeitalic.com/fonts/luxury.shtml</a> <br> <br>But then I realized... that's probably just want you wanted. Stirring up people like this is a surefire way to get them to look at your site. You might's well have just pissed off Fox News - then everyone and their uncle would be buying your fonts. Even though they already are? <br> <br>So, "Chris," a pretty thinly veiled cover-up, that's pretty darn smart. Color me impressed.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The site does need to be in English, yes. <br> <br>But they're not selling "nothing", don't worry! <br>The low end of the font market is so crowded that simply raising prices for the same product puts you in a less competitive segment, with the perception of greater value/prestige. Plus when a customer pays a lot for something he guards it better. I think they're making more money this way, even though it's still not much. Same with Peter Bilak for example. <br> <br>Just because you can't afford their products doesn't mean they're bad people. Just the fact that a good thing exists should make you happy, no matter that you will never possess it. When I look at a Bugatti EB110SS, I don't become envious, I become happy. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I assume that TEFF and DTL are wonderful people. I just think they don't have their act together on marketing. I claim zero expertise on this, but I just don't see the sense of pricing yourself out of one of the biggest markets on earth. <br> <br>If I thought the pricing made sense, it wouldn't irritate me (a childish reaction on my part, I admit). If you price me, a hobbyist, out of the market, it is no problem. But if you have professional graphic designers like Keith Tam and Tiffany Wardle wanting your stuff and feeling they can't buy it, and you don't see it anywhere in print in spite of many admirerers, I say you are messing up. <br> <br>I mean the fact that I see Christian Schwartz's 'Luxury' on a huge billboard in New York City seems to me to say he wasn't an idiot in the way he priced it. The fact that I don't see Trinite anywhere makes me think their pricing is a mistake. <br> <br>Just, anyone, explain to me if you can how not selling in the largest market is good marketing. <br> <br>*** <br>Adobe and Linotype per weight: $21 <br>DTL, per weight: $100 <br>TEFF, per weight: $300 <br> <br>To get all of Trinite is about $3,000 <br>To get all of Minion Pro (regular and condensed), <br>is $400. <br>*** <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>William, if you can sell one font family license for $3000 rather than seven font family licenses for $400 each, why would you consider this bad marketing, especially if the service overhead for each license is the same? Given the extent of font piracy in the larger market, there is something to be said for high prices and a limited market: among other things, you can be pretty certain that TEFF has a very different relationship with its customers than Adobe has. Likewise Gerard Unger, and also some American type designers such as Sumner Stone. Interesting to note that Sumner used to work for Adobe, so he knows both sides of the font pricing question. If you buy a font from the Stone Foundry, you not only pay a lot more than you would for an Adobe font, you also have to <i>sign</i> a license contract. Such things reinforce the value of what is being purchased. <br> <br>I don't think either approach is <i>bad</i> marketing. They are different approaches to different markets. There are people who are willing to pay a premium for quality fonts and who understand that one of the things they are paying for is relative exclusivity: they want fonts that not every Tom, Dick and Harriet graphic designer has on his or her hard drive. <br> <br>Are you saying that it is bad marketing for Emiglio Zegna to price their clothes so that the Walmart shoppers can't afford them? <br> <br>And how do you measure the success of a small foundry like TEFF? Peter Matthias and his colleagues feed, clothe and house themselves and their families. Is it also necessary for a small foundry to become a big foundry? Or to enslave itself to shareholders and the constant drive for higher and higher profits?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eduardo, I don't see the difference in the 'A's. What is the difference? (I am talking about the ALDO logo not the flash animation, which I guess has some light Helvetica.) <br> <br>John, I agree that both approaches can make sense, or not. It just depends on the market - or, to use economists language, on the price elasticity for the good in question. <br> <br>I also can easily believe an alternative theory: that the TEFF and DTL people make their livelihood mainly from teaching and commissioned work, and that the foundries are sidelines. And that they are too busy with other stuff to market properly. <br> <br>(Evidence: DTL has been promising that van Krimpen's Romulus, which I adore, would be out in three months, for about three years. The current 'deadline' is August 2003; it has been changed four times, I think. They are also selling FontMaster, which seems to be a higher priority.) <br> <br>Being an abominable marketer myself, I would be the last to say this weakness puts the good folks at these places in a bad light. <br> <br>You may be right that they are following an optimal path for marketing. But I tend to believe my eyes. I don't see their faces here, and the work is great stuff, according to many on these boards, as well as amateur me. To me that raises a real question mark. <br> <br>As to Hrant's reasonable question why they should succeed there and not here: it is different selling to their countrymen, who will buy out of friendship and national loyalty in a small country. <br> <br>I'm definitely not saying I know better. And I learned from a similar discussion on Typographica that eg. different car models price for different niches. But I am saying that the evidence makes me question whether charging ten times more really is an economic benefit to them. <br> <br>In this thread people are questioning Christian Schwartz's decision on 'Luxury', and defending DTL and TEFF. My intuition is that it is the other way around. I've been wrong before, lots, but I notice that sometimes when that little bell goes off sometimes I'm right too.</div>

<div class=commentbody>this is Christian Schwartz, posting an explanation of Luxury. <br> <br>from the blogspot days of Typographi.ca <br> <br><blockquote><hr size=0><b>quote:</b><p>er... that's the joke. The Luxury Collection is our attempt to comment on the fact that the multitude of high-fashion logos can be boiled down into three fonts. "fashionable" things look a very specific way, and consumers allow them to be priced accordingly. we were hoping the ridiculous price would clue people in on the fact that the set is a joke. (the thought of someone paying $1500 for these three fonts, now that's funny!) <br> <br>is there a place for social commentary and satire in type design? is the idea of a type family as conceptual art too much of a stretch? or is the problem that we were too straight-faced with our execution? because in this case, i think the attitude IS the function. <br> <br>in any case, we were planning for this set to be more of a publicity stunt than a product that sold a whole lot of copies. and it looks like that part, at least, is working out pretty well.<hr size=0></blockquote> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>"Christian, you are a greater genius than I previously thought. <br> <br>Here I thought, there's some guy just trying to get under peoples' collars by picking on you. I was all about to post a long reply with a link to your website to show that anyone who actually bothered to read it would know that your typefaces aren't "piddly." <br> <br><a href=http://www.orangeitalic.com/fonts/luxury.shtml target=_blank>http://www.orangeitalic.com/fonts/luxury.shtml</a> <br> <br>But then I realized... that's probably just want you wanted. Stirring up people like this is a surefire way to get them to look at your site. You might's well have just pissed off Fox News - then everyone and their uncle would be buying your fonts. Even though they already are? <br> <br>So, "Chris," a pretty thinly veiled cover-up, that's pretty darn smart. Color me impressed." <br> <br>------------------------- <br> <br>Um...ooookay? :rolleyes:</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, Eduardo, you are right, ALDO is not set in Luxury Gold. <br> <br>The fact that Luxury and its its price were a joke - and didn't sell - to me just reinforces my puzzlement about the TEFF and DTL pricing. <br> <br>I wonder, is there a difference in the way fonts are licensed and used in the Netherlands? For example, a different relation between publishers and designers? I feel like there is a missing piece to this story. </div>

<div class=commentbody>> Ooh, "enslaved to our shareholders." That's a great phrase. <br> <br>Laughter is indeed the best medicine. Except when the illness is terminal. <br> <br>> The fact that Luxury and its its price were a joke - and didn't sell - to me just <br>> reinforces my puzzlement about the TEFF and DTL pricing. <br> <br>1) I think it might have started out as a joke, but maybe later on it no longer was? <br>2) Consumers don't get jokes like that anyway. They prefer Seinfeld. <br>3) You don't know if it sold or not. And fonts don't go bad. Sometimes they even start out bad and 20 years later people suddenly start salivating over it. <br>4) Stop feeling so puzzled, and give TEFF and DTL the benefit of the doubt of knowing their markets. <br> <br>As for differences between The Netherlands and the US, the former does have much stronger restrictions on reproduction (like you're not allowed to even scan a font specimen), but licensing is basically the same, I think. However, the Dutch are simply prepared to pay more for fonts, while over here people pay would rather pay more for Hummers. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
