  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Our University department is changing its name from Quantitative Management to Decision Sciences. Our teaching and research focuses mainly on the mathematics underlying decision making and management processes.  <BR> <BR>We need a new logo to reflect the new name. It should also give some hint of the fact that mathematics is the focus. We played around with the Greek sigma and delta &#40;often used in a mathematical context&#41;, roman s and d, and the integration sign. &#40;We shy away from the capital Sigma or summation sign because it is overused.&#41; <BR> <BR>We &#40;mathematicians, not typographers or designers&#41; came up with the following concept. The idea is that it should alternate between a d and an S in the mind of the reader. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif" alt="ds"> <BR> <BR>Any advice will be appreciated! <BR> <BR>Chris Swanepoel <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments, Scott. The first use of the logo would be as background design for a preprint cover -- hence the pale colours. &#40;It will have to be even paler to prevent it from interfering too much with the black title that will be overprinted on the cover...&#41; For other uses it makes sense to have it bolder. There are no colours with mathematical significance, as far as I know.  <BR> <BR>Would it be better to frame the symbol when it is printed as say red or dark blue on white, to get a rectangular logo, or should it be used without a frame?  <BR> <BR>Not being designers, we would appreciate any suggestions on refinements of the weight, curves, etc. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Chris</div>

The middle arrow indicates the area where I see the greatest need for consistency in weight/thickness relationship. The bottom arrow and lines indicate a curve relationship that I think can be improved by pushing the right side out a little. <BR> <BR>I also agree with Soren about using the graphic mark without framing it. <BR> <BR>As far as the background image goes</div>

		<div class="commentbody">CJ: <BR> <BR>The bottom two designs don&#39;t make any sense to me, but I like the improvements made in the top two designs. I like that you have created a heavier version, but it might be a little too heavy. If the heavier version is bold and the lighter version is regular, then you are looking for a medium. If you look at your bold version, it looks like it is going to fall over &#40;to the right&#41;. To eliminate this unbalance, I have cut off the little returning curve from the end of the &#34;S&#34; and I have cut off a significant portion of the arm at the beginning of the &#34;S&#34;. <BR> <BR>This is rough, because your original JPEGs are very rough/pixelated, but hopefully it will give you an idea of what I mean. Also, the bottom probably needs to be a little thicker and the top arc might need to be rounded out a little more. I&#39;m not positive about the arc, though, because it might only read as an &#34;S&#34;&#39;, whereas, right now, it looks unatural, like two shapes are melded together</div>
