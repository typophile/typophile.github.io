body: I've got a client who's trying to install some fonts on a couple of hundred
  computers (Yes :-) he purchased an MUL!), and is asking me if there's anyway to
  roll them out to all systems at once, from one location. An automated SCCM package?
  Other suggestions? Thanks!

    to be for Font Reserve when that was the thing). I haven't looked it up in quite
    some time.\r\n\r\nNot sure if that's exactly what you had in mind, but it's a
    start."

    push them to the computers using whatever system is already in place for managing
    remote installs. The fonts just need to be copied into the appropriate folder.
    If there\u2019s no need to actually track the numbers of people using the fonts
    no special software should be needed."

    I've found browsing the internet as well. I was hoping their might be an \"easy
    solution\" but alas... not yet! Thanks again!"
