    <BR>I was amazed because it seems you are always on line. I thought you probably
    live in Europe... and bingo... <BR> <BR>;-&#41;

  body: Uh-uh, it&#39;s Raunak Roy, the original poster who said that.  <BR>And I&#39;ve
    got the impression he was expecting to get hold  <BR>of it for free. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>BTW This proves that some script caps aren&#39;t
    readable at all <BR>when they&#39;re not set &#39;in context&#39; with lowercase.
    What a butt- <BR>ugly composition.

  body: Oops. Should have checked that before posting. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s an Italian
    restaurant in the Twin Cities called Buca that uses Brush Script in all caps for
    its name/logo. The food is very good, but I am always a bit horrified when I see
    their sign.

    hideous in all caps. <BR> <BR>There oughta be type police that hand out summons
    for things like that... quality of life crimes as we call them in NYC.
