  body: "From \"An Introduction to Book History\" By David Finkelstein and Alistair
    McCleery, Routledge  2005\r\nThe printing workforce divided into a hierarchy:
    apprentices, journeymen, and master printers. As in most trades, young apprentices
    were indentured for two to five years into the service of a master who would provide
    training, food and board, clothing, and occasional payment. The apprentice would
    clean the workshop, run errands, prepare ink, pull the press, and ultimately learn
    the more skilled jobs from journeymen. A journeyman was a specialist -- an apprentice
    who had graduated to the role of compositor, corrector, type designer, and press
    operator. <...>\r\n\r\nThe average print shop supported half-a-dozen workmen,
    some permanent and some journeymen. The master printer, or in larger operations
    a head compositor, would oversee the printing process. Two men, a printer and
    an inker, would operate the press itself, supplied with paper by a warehouseman.<...>\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "Christopher:\r\n\r\nI do not know what you mean by \"old,\"but here's an
    account of how such hierarchies worked in the USA in the late 1960s and into the
    late 1970s.\r\n\r\nIn 1968 I took a job as an apprentice hand compositor at a
    small non-union job & novelty letterpress shop in rural Ohio. I knew nothing about
    how to set type. The other comp & I were overseen by a foreman who had been a
    union journeyman, but there was no formal apprenticeship or recognized progression
    to higher levels. I also learned to run both the hand-fed platen press and the
    Heidelberg windmill platen press.\r\n\r\n18 months later I moved to a letterpress
    book printing shop in rural Vermont, also non-union. I was put on the apprentice-to-journeyman
    track, under the supervision of a guy from the state's department of labor who
    visited the shop a few times a year. For 5 years my progress was tracked by the
    foreman, who reported on me to the state guy. I had texts to read and tests to
    take. At the end of 5 years I got my state-issued journey card. It is one of my
    prized possessions.\r\n\r\nI soon left that job and spent 9 months as night proofreader
    in a non-union magazine printing plant (not letterpress). The journeyman's card
    was useless. After a spell I went to Los Angeles, on the promise of journeyman's
    wages. HA! The shop was non-union; when I started work I was told I'd earn about
    half the journeyman's wage. It's a long story; I stayed there 6 months because
    I had no financial choice.\r\n\r\nThen I opened my own shop in San Francisco,
    non-union, I and a partner. After a spell I was asked to become a hand comp in
    a composition house in SF. My Vermont journeycard was not worth a bucket of warm
    spit and I was paid apprentice wages. I was 35 and had been a non-union journeyman
    hand comp for 5 years. But it was still the most money I'd ever made, so I stayed
    9 months. I was finally a union member, but all it got me was support from the
    steward when the owner tried to fire me for refusing overtime.\r\n\r\nAs far as
    the \"Master Printer\" designation goes, I never encountered that as a formal
    designation. I think that may have truly been in the \"Old\" days. To this day,
    looking back from a computer keyboard, I call myself a Master Printer because
    I was one of the best hand compositors in the Monotype industry at the time.\r\n\r\nI
    hope that sheds some light.\r\n\r\npowers"

    that as a formal designation. I think that may have truly been in the \u201COld\u201D
    days.</em>\r\n\r\nThe debut of Gill Sans occurred on a pamphlet distributed to
    the annual conference of British master printers in 1928.\r\n\r\nIn 1933 Gill
    observed, to another crowd of \"master printers\": \"To be a 'master printer'
    to-day means that you know how to sell the printing done by your employees. The
    master printer is primarily a man of business.\"\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps we can see
    them conceding that fact 41 years later: [[http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/ead/375col.htm|\"The
    Federation of Master Printers and Allied Trades of the United Kingdom of Great
    Britain and Ireland was founded in Apr 1901. In June 1931 the Federation's name
    was changed to the British Federation of Master Printers. In April 1974 its name
    was changed again to become the British Printing Industries Federation.\"]]"

  body: "All interesting. Master Printer is a business man of printing. I think it
    implies the classic notion of printing being related to some sort of art allied
    to science. Printers in the good old days were scientists and versed in the arts
    in general, and the economics of the production.\r\n \r\nIn my days in letterpress,
    we called it like this:\r\nApprentice Composition - 2 years\r\nHalf-Officer Composition
    - 3 years\r\nCompositor - 5 years\r\n\r\nApprentice Pressman  - 2 years\r\nHalf-Officer
    Pressman  - 3 years\r\nPressman  - 5 years\r\n\r\nI finally understand now the
    concept of Jorneyman and the Union Shop."

  body: "This isn't about the apprentice/journeyman/master printer classification,
    just a bit about the old days.\r\n\r\nI've set a few books designed by George
    Mackie. George was a British pilot in World War II, to give some idea of his age.
    He is also a Royal Designer to Industry (RDI) in graphic design, as is Matthew
    Carter in type design. In other words, he was good.\r\n\r\nThe specifications
    for a book would be something like \"set it in 11.5 Baskerville, leaded 2 points\"
    There would be a specification of the font for the chapter openings, but the comp
    was expected to know & work out most spacings, & often the subheads, extracts,
    and notes. There would be layouts, but not heavily marked, and not everything
    was even traced. You just had to get the idea from the sketches, and put it together.\r\n\r\nWhile
    perhaps less was possible technically in those days, more was required of the
    comp. You couldn't turn such a set of specifications & layouts over to an apprentice,
    at least if you didn't want to bear the wrath from someone like George. You probably
    couldn't give that set of specifications to any comp today without getting a squawk
    -- certainly no one else at out shop, and some of them have 20+ years experience.\r\n\r\nAs
    a designer, George would rewrite the copy if he felt he had good reason. The publisher
    invariably would back him up. Many of the experienced people in publishing & printing
    knew more than the specifics of their particular task, and were expected to contribute
    \ all of their skills. Well, within reason.\r\n\r\nI imagine Will Powers knows
    something about this kind of work; unless I miss my guess, the shop he worked
    at in Vermont was started by a (U.S.) WWII fighter pilot who was a good friend
    of George Mackie, and a kindred spirit."

  body: "A+ to Charles for acuity. He refers to the Stinehour Press of Lunenburg,
    Vermont. That's where I got my skill as a compositor, and first saw how books
    were designed well. Sad to say, the press just closed its doors; prospects for
    re-opening appear dubious, from what I hear.\r\n\r\nRegarding the relations of
    Master Printers to Journeymen, I can offer an echo of Charles's George Mackie
    tale. Lawton Kennedy was one of San Francisco's venerable letterpress book printers.
    As a comp at the Mackenzie-Harris Monotype composition house, I was once handed
    a sheaf of galley proofs, along with the ms, on which were no specifications other
    than the desired page count. The owner of M&H knew Lawton's work was to be set
    in Caslon and he knew the page size; he specified text face & size, measure &
    leading. Display, page depth, chapter drops, folios, initials: all that and more
    was left to me, the Journeyman. I had to make the book come into the page count,
    in full 16's, acting under the gaze of the Master, the shop owner.\r\n\r\nBut
    only a designer with real clout, as George Mackie, can re-write copy. I prefer
    the old adage given to apprentices: \"Follow the copy, even if it flies out the
    window and you must jump out after it.\" Designers & typesetters should be encouraged
    to write queries on mss when they see either possible errors or textual ways to
    improve design. But not to change copy. That said, I just got page proofs back
    from a design shop with a note explaining why they have dropped a subhead for
    both design and text reasons. This is a shop with which we work frequently. They
    are approaching a Mackie-like degree of clout after 9 years working with us.\r\n\r\npowers"
