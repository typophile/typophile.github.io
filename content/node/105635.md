  to promote and for his covers. Could you tell me what's the font he used ?\r\nMaybe
  it could help : for his first album he used Century Gothic. It seems this font looks
  like the font i'm looking for.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea of the name of this font
  ?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help !\r\n\r\nJ."
