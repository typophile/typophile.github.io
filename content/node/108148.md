  body: Since the Two As on the bottom line are different widths I think it was hand
    done - although it appears to have printer info at bottom - maybe silkscreen.

  body: "Agree Bob that it's lettering. There are quite a few condensed Gothics [sans
    serifs] but none are really close, having crossbars on the A that are lower than
    the lettering.\r\nFor example Gothic Narrow by Wooden Type Fonts\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/gothic-narrow/\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: Good call Don on close - but the M and N have very interesting swells to them
    - In Memphis I was thinking poster wood type first but the the angles just seem
    different and heavy to the bottom. Interesting typeface for sure.

  body: "Of course the problem with saying any font resembles the lettering is that
    we have no idea how the artist would have dealt with earmark letters like R and
    Q.\r\ndon"
