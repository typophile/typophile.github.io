    Not what said \"Earthquake\". The poor guy who answered \"American Patriot\" now
    looks silly, because what does that have to do with earthquakes?\r\n\r\nThat was
    a mean trick to play on him.\r\n\r\nAnd how come I can only edit <em>my</em> posts
    right after I make them, not later?"

    for something that will compliment a Liberty Bell. Of it the Liberty Bell was
    a font, what would it look like?\r\n\r\nI was thinking something heavy, chiseled..
    or? I can see the font in my head.. just cant find it!"
