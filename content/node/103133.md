body: "My first post here. hiii : )\r\n\r\nI'm wondering about general thoughts on
  pairing Antique Olive with Chaparral Pro? There seems to be few discussions on the
  former typeface and I'm wondering if someone could offer their insights. This is
  for resume & portfolio layout, with light Antique Olive as body text (8/11 pt) and
  light Chaparral Pro as headers in all caps at 8pt. \r\nBeing a type novice and new
  to this font combination, I'd greatly appreciate any thoughts or opinions.\r\n\r\nSome
  concerns I have are:\r\n1) readability\r\n2) the general impression it conveys\r\n3)
  hisory/cultural associations?\r\n\r\nI like Chaparral, and in looking for a san-seirf
  complement I came across Antique Olive. Personally I enjoy the big x-height and
  the warm, statuesque feeling the typeface conveys. However I've heard that this
  is a hard typeface to work with and I'm afraid that it might be attracting more
  attention than it wants as a body text? I thought about using Chaparral as body
  text, but felt that it's a bit too delicate and distracting for my taste.\r\n\r\nRegarding
  big x-height and readability, here's a thread that discusses it at great length:
  http://typophile.com/node/31427\r\nI'm keeping the body text at fairly short lengths
  (5-10 words per line), and have increased the leading, but still not totally sure
  if everything works together. Any comments, thoughts, opinions? \r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I personally like Antique Olive. It's got a lot more personality than most
    sans serifs. Its non-uniform stroke weight contributes to this, as do the vertical
    cutoff on the <strong>C</strong>, <strong>G</strong>, and <strong>S</strong>,
    and the idiosyncratic shape of the bowls on the <strong>B</strong>, <strong>P</strong>,
    and <strong>R</strong>.\r\n\r\nI've never used Antique Olive smaller than 12 point.
    You may be able to read it at 8 point--if you're an undergraduate, you're probably
    younger than my children--but I can't, and some of the people you want to read
    your resume are my age."

    body: "Hi there, that's a great thing you pointed out, thanks a lot. My worry
      is that the letter shapes will start to call too much attention to themselves
      (with the big counters and vertical emphasis, regrettably, some of the very
      things I like about the typeface), especially since it's used as body text.
      \r\n\r\nMaybe it's too much for a resume...I'll keep experimenting with Antique
      Olive and also trying out some other options. In the mean time, does anyone
      have suggestions for a similar sans serif that's a bit more understated and
      appropriate? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    seems to be a very readable typeface, and shares some features of Antique Olive
    - the top-heavy weight distribution in particular. Its designer, the late Evert
    Bloemsma, is higly appreciated among typophiles. But I don't know how Balance
    could work when paired with Chaparral."

    body: Nicola, thanks for the suggestion. The idea of tension between shape and
      counter-shape is very intriguing. It's fascinating how the shapes stand out
      so much when the letters are seen large, yet becomes almost invisible (or rather
      becomes something else) when used at text size.

  body: "When working with such an unconventional and expressive typeface, I would
    strongly consider relying on its family of weights and styles alone. Optionally,
    you can leave the expressiveness to display and tone down the text.\r\n\r\nBtw,

      \u2013 guess I have to set my mind to buying the typeface in order to find out.
      Thanks for the tip about Antique Olive : )"
