  It has a few distinctive features, such as the shapes of the G and the J. I don't
  know if it's all caps or if the guys who used it wrote in caps, but I think it's
  the former.\r\nThank you very much for always being of assistance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CH-01_008_5399.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CH-03_113_6541.jpg]"
