body: I understand that Arial was commissioned by Miscrosoft as a sub for helvetica
  so that they would not have to pay helvetica royalties....So does that mean that
  Windows does not ship with the Helvetica at all? Curious.... OS X has both Helvetica
  and Arial, so am wondering if Windows only has Arial?

    Word, I think you get Helvetica and numerous other typefaces then.\r\n\r\nBut
    there are open-source typefaces that clone Helvetica, so Microsoft users are not
    that deeply disadvantaged.\r\n\r\nJohn Savard"

  body: "Arial pre-dates Windows; IIRC it IBM was using it first, near the time when
    it was made, 1982.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft generally got Monotype fonts (the Garamond,
    Gill Sans, News Gothic and a few others bundled with MS Office were Monotype licences;
    Times New Roman is from Monotype) around the time, which they stuck with and I
    suppose it's why they picked up Arial, being compatible in metrics to Helvetica.\r\n\r\nI
    think some of the Nimbus (URW) family are available open-source, which is their
    version of Helvetica."

    Office at all...I got the XML Mac Office update, and navigated through tons of
    folders hidden in the install package and got the fonts...YEAH!!!

  body: So you are using fonts included in an update package for a piece of software
    for which you don't have a license, and whose purpose is to enable file conversion
    between different versions of that software for which you don't have a license?

    an update package for the Office program....It does not effect Office at all so
    its not an updater for it since it does nothing to Office....It works with Office
    output document files that are made with Office.....It just alters documents,
    word processing documents, etc. Its not an update package for office, is does
    not effect or alter office at all, even if i had it...It just alters output files....The
    Mac for years has had document converters to convert to different formats....many
    times its to convert to formats for programs that one may not have to use it with
    someone that has one of those programs...Graphic Conveter does the same thing
    for graphics.....Many do not own the other programs that use that format. Sorry,

    want to check the terms of the license under which the fonts are made available

  body: Well, since I never ran the installer, I did not see any licensing info. I
    trashed the installer....I in OS X just opened up the package contents and went
    into a bunch of nested folders.....It was a free separate stand alone program
    that Microsoft gives out, so I will just use the fonts that came with that free
    program... Complain to Microsoft if you do not want them giving out your fonts
    in a free standalone program that they give away, not me.... I had nothing to
    do with what Microsoft freely gives away to the public regarding what is included
    as part of a standalone Microsoft freeware program. Getting freeware programs
    is not cheap, it's simply practical.

  body: "When it comes to fonts, Microsoft's position is quite clearly stated:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The
    fonts are governed by the same restrictions as the products they are supplied
    with. You are not allowed to copy, redistribute or reverse engineer the font files.
    For full details see the license agreement supplied with the product. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo
    whether you saw the licensing information for the XML converter tool or not, the
    fonts you helped yourself to are governed by that license. It may be the case
    that this license in fact does not prohibit what you have done, my point is that
    you should check the license and not <em>presume</em> that the fonts are some
    kind of free gift."

    still have just the original font files that were in the freeware....I bought
    Photoshop and bought Painter, and they both came with some included fonts.....This
    freeware program came with some fonts....So I will just use them just like I use
    Adobe Caslon Pro or Adobe Garamond Pro that came with Photoshop, or New Century
    Schoolbook that came with Corel Painter etc etc....Discussion closed....

  body: And even if Windows <em>N</em> ships without Helvetica, you can always snag
    an open-licensed Nimbus Sans from somewhere. It is close enough to Helvetica for
    most work. Oh, and if a client absolutely insists on Helvetica, you can always
    bring out that super-secret internally-relabeled-to-Helvetica Nimbus Sans and
    then tell Mr. Customer that you'll likely have to do some final adjustments on
    his machine 'cause your Helvetica differs from his. (Hmm... Add this to the book
    on what to do when a client wants Adobe Optima and you're still saving up for
    it?)
