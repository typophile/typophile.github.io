    body: "Sure, I have added  some more examples in attachment.\r\n\r\nIts the typelogo
      of a very small run \"article\" magazine, I believe they've only done 3 issues.
      You can only find their magazines in certain shops.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious typeface
      is used throughout their magazine, so I now find it hard to imagine that each
      title is customised from Galliard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I suggested don't appear to have a swash Q.\r\n\r\nIf it's a British publication,
    I'm guessing it's a UK foundry typeface; checking now...."
