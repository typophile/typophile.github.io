body: "I have designed a custom type family for a client. It\xB4s an OTF family with
  6 weights plus their italics. All has been well so far, and the fonts have worked
  well in both Mac and Windows. However, now that they install the fonts to PCs using
  Office 2007 programs (Word, Excel, Powerpoint) there are problems that, I guess,
  are caused by the naming of the fonts: the fonts are not visible on the pull-down
  menus or they appear there with strange names. Is there something specific to this
  generation of Windows? I really am not an expert on this, and would appreciate any
  help for finding solutions or hints as to where seek for help!\r\nThanks, Saku.\r\n"

  body: "Windows has a limit on the number of styles in a font family. You can only
    have plain, italic, bold, bold italic. Any more than that and the fonts will not
    be available in standard Windows apps. (You will be able to use them in Adobe
    apps and some others.) Basically, you need to break your family into smaller sub-families
    that fit this limitation.\r\n\r\nAdam Twardoch has written a guide on how to do
    this on the FontLab Forum: \r\n\r\nhttp://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio-tips-and-tricks/font-family-naming-in-fontlab-studio-5-t313.0.html"

    but I wasn\xB4t this far myself back then. The guide you linked to looks clear
    and comprehensive, and hopefully I can solve the problems now. Cheers, Saku."
