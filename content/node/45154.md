  and that you're not stuck in an office like me\u2026\r\n\r\nQuick question;\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know if in InDesign it is possible to set underlines to miss out descenders
  - so that there is a small gap? \r\n\r\nBest wishes, \r\n\r\nGraham "

    there is a 2 pt paper coloured stroke added to the bottom text:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pyykkipalju_3472.jpg]"

  body: "Sure. Get the underline through the character palate. One of the options
    is *offset*. Change that until you clear your descenders as much as you want.\r\n\r\nThe
    snippet below is down & dirty; looking at it, it needs a bit more weight (I used
    .33 points for the rule) and still a bit more offset, but it does clear the descenders.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/underline_3759.gif]"

  body: "Another workaround would be to make two character styles, one with underlines
    and one without. After your text is set, you can easily replace critical characters
    ( , \u201E \xBF g j p q y for example) with the find&change function (Menu/Edit/Find&Change).
    There you would only replace the character styles and the chosen characters will
    have a gap in their underlining.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild_6122.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild3_3767.png]\r\n\r\n(hope
    the second picture helps ;-)"

  body: I really like Mills solution the best. I often discourage underlines in place
    of the alternates in font weights, but his trick worth using because it adds to
    esthetic value.

    dangerous because the white outline is eventually going to obscure part of an
    adjacent glyph, isn't it?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: Out of curiosity, when is one going to be underlining text these days in print?
    I've always thought that on paper it was used if you were stuck with a typewriter
    and online if it was a link.

  body: "Don't lapidate me, but I sometimes actually like to use underline: when writing
    letters (i.e. e-mails as well), underlining for emphasis gives it an additional
    \"hand-written\" note without having to resort to italics for body text, which
    is an overkill for readibility.\r\n\r\nYou know, they say, there is no bad type,
    only people who cannot use it. I think, this applies for most design elements,
    including underlining. (Though I'm not claiming to know how to use it, I'm pretty
    confident about using it in that context).\r\n\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"
