body: "Hey ,\r\n\r\nWhile trying to create a glyph for a particularly tricky character(
  namely G), I faced infinite trouble as i can not get it to look just like my sketch.
  So i though i would scan it and place it as a BG image over which i can trace, but
  unfortunately when i am placing the scanned image(after increasing the contrast
  in PS) i am only getting a grey box with very little detail.\r\nSo, i was wondering
  if there is another way to make a template layer (Like illustrator: take a photo
  and dim it down and lock it) with the scanned image?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nT"

    errors in them too so I'm wondering how relevant/critical these errors are? I
    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant
    to others.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dinariraqi.com/\">Iraqi

    my liking (admittedly I did not try particularly hard) I usually end up doing
    the same work in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nI have never used it but [[http://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/scanfont/|FontLab's
    tool ScanFont]] is supposed to do just what you need. Hopefully with the [[http://typophile.com/node/96562#comment-524962|new
    tool being developed by the FontLab team]] something like this will exist within
    the main font editing application."

  body: FontLab's ScanFont will not work with any Mac OS after 10.6 and is NOT going
    to be upgraded in case you are on a Mac. I think they intend to integrate the
    product into FontLab Studio at some point but only the developers know when that
    might be.

    and drop that into fontlab as a mask (Cmd-M) and then draw it correctly.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    FontLab <strong>seems</strong> to render raster backgrounds differently depending
    on the zoom level and resolution of the object."

    to do anything but fuck my shit up. It was only a method for Mr Gruff to get something
    to trace in Fontlab.\r\n\r\nI'm really anal about these things...I even draw characters
