body: "Hi all.\r\n\r\nWhat with web fonts becoming more viable, I'm revisiting the
  sans-serif that's paired with my client's serif, Century Schoolbook. It was Arial.\r\n\r\nI
  did my homework and it suggests something nicely grot/gothic, so I'm trying out
  News Cycle (which, I think, shares DNA with News Gothic and Franklin Gothic). It's
  holding up well in print (sans for headers, serif for body) but not so well on-screen
  (News Cycle for body text is very thin and light).\r\n\r\nOf course I'm experimenting
  with other options, and Frutiger-like / Avenir-like faces are working out gorgeously.
  So it's got me searching for the good serif to pair with them.\r\n\r\nMore homework,
  of course: I learned that there's Meridien and similar. Problem is, that's too much
  of a departure from Century Schoolbook. I may have leeway to update the main logo/identity,
  but only in an evolutionary kind of way (rather than a clear departure).\r\n\r\n<strong>Bottom
  line: what looks like Century Schoolbook, but more up-to-date and more matchable
  to Frutiger/Avenir?</strong>\r\n\r\nThanks, in advance, for your brains.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nAmado"

  body: Simply because a typeface falls "out of fashion" does not mean that it does
    not remain a good, attractive and serviceable typeface. Furthermore, Century Schoolbook
    <em>actually</em> shares DNA with News Gothic and Franklin Gothic, because all
    three were designed by Morris Fuller Benton. Is it possible that you're overthinking
    this, and finding a problem where none exists?

    Modern</a> would be a compatible text face that works well in print; Their 'Reading
    Edge' version of Benton Modern was drawn specifically for screen & is available

    Shinn's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/shinntype/scotch_modern_full_family/\">Scotch
    Modern</a> comes in a variety of cuts (quite handy for book work) and looks fine
    on most screens when set at a reasonable size. Both these suggestions come with
    companion sanses, I might add: Benton Sans (drawn in the vein of News Gothic)
    and Figgins Sans, respectively.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to depart from the high
    contrast of the moderns a bit, I might suggest Kent Lew's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/whitman/\">Whitman</a>.
    It makes for some very, very approachable text."

    if you want a companion for Frutiger, might I suggest considering a humanist slab

  body: "All,\r\n\r\nI've gotten some fantastic direction here, thanks so much.\r\n\r\nNothing
    against Century Schoolbook - it has served this client well, and I would probably
    prefer to find a Franklin/News webfont that I think I can make work on-screen
    as body text, and go with that. Fewer things to change. \r\n\r\nBut if the client
    asks for a sans that's more Frutiger-esque (rather than FranklinNews-esque), I
    want somewhere to go.\r\n\r\nFor this application, I find both Whitman and Mondegreen
    wonderful. But Kinney is, I think, perfect. The kind of face that the client might
    not even recognize as changed, but that will go well with a sans more geometric
    than gothic.\r\n\r\nSo, thanks again. Feel free to weigh in if you've got anything
    to add."

  body: "@Nick Shinn:\r\n<cite>Avenir (1988) is \"up-to-date\"?</cite>\r\n\r\nTimes
    Roman (1932) is up-to-date, and even Goudy Old Style (1915) hardly seems dated.
    On the other hand, Century Expanded (1900) is starting to show a little age.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, current revivals of Garamond and Baskerville are still going strong. But,
    sadly, in my admittedly inexpert opinion, Cloister Lightface (1924) for some reason
    does seem to have a slight tinge of the period in which it was designed, rather
    than being a pure and timeless revival of the original Jenson.\r\n\r\nAnd so Optima
    (1955) is still daring and modern.\r\n\r\nThus, a typeface being designed in 1988
    is no barrier to being up-to-date. Even if ITC Stone, from 1987, is described
    as an \"ITC Classic\", I think it is quite novel."
