body: "I have updated the <strong>Font Family Naming</strong> recommendations to take
  into account problems with accessing fonts in extended families when using Microsoft
  Word 2011 for Mac. The updated recommendations are available on the FontLab forum:
  \r\n<strong><a href=\"http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=313.0\">http://forum.fontlab.com/index.php?topic=313.0</a></strong>.
  \r\n\r\nThe shortlist of changes is: \r\n1. Do not style-link across weights different
  than 400 and 700 (i.e. only style-link uprights with italics unless the weights
  really are 400 and 700). \r\n2. Disable the previously enabled Option \u201CUse
  the OpenType names as menu names on Macintosh\u201D.\r\n3. Disable the previously
  enabled Option \u201CUse PostScript FontName as FullName on Windows\u201D.\r\n4.
  Manually remove name IDs 16.1.0.0 and 17.1.0.0 (Mac Preferred names). \r\n\r\nThe
  short rationale of changes is: modern Mac OS X systems and Adobe applications on
  the Mac use the \"Windows preferred\" (16.3.1.1033 and 17.3.1.1033). The Mac preferred
  names are not used except in Word 2011, which uses them badly: in the Format / Font
  dialog box, Word 2011 uses the normal Windows names (1.3.1.1033 and 2.3.1.1033)
  but in the Font menu, Word 2011 uses a strange mixture of normal Mac names (1.1.0.0
  and 2.1.0.0) and of preferred Mac names (16.1.0.0 and 17.1.0.0). If normal Mac names
  don't match the normal Windows names, then styles disappear randomly. If the preferred
  Mac style name (17.1.0.0) is different from the normal Mac style name (2.1.0.0),
  then the same font is listed twice under different names. If normal Mac names match
  the normal Windows names, and there are no preferred Mac names, then Word 2011 lists
  the fonts the same way as Word 2010 on Windows would do (i.e. using styling groups
  with up to 4 styles) but at least this works consistently. Most or all other Mac
  and Adobe apps will still use the Windows preferred names, so the typographic grouping
  will still work there. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
