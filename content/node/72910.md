  of Mesrine Killer Instinct (http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/mesrinekillerinstinct/)\r\n\r\nThe
  closest I get is Knockout from Hoefler & Frere-Jones but it is not quite right (compare
  the S's).\r\n\r\nIf someone can name the other typefaces used in the trailer that
  would be fun as well :-)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mesrine_6262.png]"

  body: "Hi Reimund-\r\n\r\nMy first instinct was Gothic by Red Rooster (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/gothic-rr/),
    but it's too wide, and the K and S are both wrong. You mentioned Hoefler's Knockout,
    which it's not, but Champion Featherweight (also by Hoefler, http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100002)
    is better, the K, S and \" are very close indeed.\r\n\r\n-NJ"

  body: "I think you are correct, it's probably Champion Gothic! I actually looked
    at Champion Gothic as well, besides Knockout. I must have looked at the wrong
    weight or something though, because I thought it was a bit off :)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    What about the challenge to find the other faces? For instance the one used for
    the big MESRINE title in the end? :)"

    between us.

  body: Twentieth Century sure is close. But looking closely on the N, where the crossbar
    meets with the stems, it looks more like Futura Extra bold.
