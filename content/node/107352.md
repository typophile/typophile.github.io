  body: The peculiar feature here is, of course, the reverse contrast scheme, similar
    to Antique Olive or Commercial's Zizou. But it's neither of those.

  body: "You are correct, Johan, the point of interest is the reverse contrast, an
    idea that dates at least as far back as 1821 with Caslon's Italian http://typophile.com/node/103389\r\nI
    had hoped that someone would find a digital match to the book cover but I see
    that I am not the only one who tried and failed to find a match.\r\nSo we can
    speculate as to several possibilites:\r\n1. This is one of Herb Lubalin's alphabets,
    perhaps only released in poster form.\r\n2. This was designed by an ECAL student
    or teacher -- as Takashi suggests. Could be artwork rather than a font as such.\r\nTo
    replicate it, perhaps the easiest option is to tinker with Transat to modify some
    of the letterforms,  then do some vertical bolding and other adjustments. Results
    of a quick test, that could be further modified for a closer match:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ReverseEmphasis1_3601.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "Congratulations Takashi on finding what the rest of us could not find. \r\nI
    wonder if \"Scotland Italian\" was ever released as a typeface?\r\nGoogle yields
    nothing.\r\nThe flash image at the website is very blurry as to who designed the
    font, although from what I can decipher it was designed for a magazine. The text
    identifies the former MAAD  students who designed the various fonts in the  \u201CTypes
    We Can Make,\u201D i.e. Andrea Anner, Luke Archer, Florine Bonaventure, Jane Cheng,
    Yann Pablo Corminboeuf, Philippe Karrer, Haakon Spencer and Matthew Fenton. If
    you want to purchase the font, or the rights to it, some detective work would
    be required to find the designer. In the interim here is an enhanced image of
    the character set:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ScotlandItalian_6029.jpg]\r\nDon"
