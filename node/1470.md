    <BR> <BR>29.002 - the caveman and the cross...they are connected. <BR>is there
    a religious connection? Are we the cave people? <BR> <BR>29.013...the guy had
    kerning in the back of his mind &#40;see picture&#41;, but <BR>in all his coffee-fueled
    creativity, he forgot about it.  <BR>spatial &#40;spacial?&#41; awareness? <BR>
    <BR>can you zoom 29.017, please? <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>are there more coming? I

    absent or given poorly from the most works &#41;. <BR> <BR>I admit it with &#34;heavy

    what I would choose. Golly, I must sound like a  <BR>broken record.  <BR> <BR>Maybe
    just the one color wireframe T on the font. On the  <BR>back the wire frame of
    typophile. &#34;Perspectives on Type &amp;  <BR>Typography&#34; All scaled and

  body: 'On 39 alt. It does say the most about typofile, and is in that sense most
    complete, as Christos has pointed out.  <BR> <BR>But completeness is not always
    an aesthetic virtue. In drama one of the ways that dialogue fails is being &#34;on
    the nose&#34;:  <BR>it says exactly what the character is thinking, which people
    rarely do in life.  <BR> <BR>I think 39 is too &#39;on the nose&#39;. Also the
    multiple perspective &#39;T&#39; is awkward looking. <BR> <BR>In the context of
    a &#39;T&#39; it seems to me that being visually exciting and causing the viewer
    to ask &#39;What&#39;s that about?&#39; is preferable.    '
