  I have attached a logo which was designed in the early 1990's for my employer, an
  engineering firm specializing in control and system integration.  It is still used,
  with some variations, in print  materials.  A different logo/look was created in
  the early 2000's for use on the company's website www.primarysys.com.  I recently
  came on-board as a one-man marketing department, and have inherited all of these
  different looks.  I'd like to develop (or re-use) a logo which will work in both
  print and on-line, in 1 color as well as 2 or 3 color.\r\n\r\nI think I have identified
  2 of the 3 fonts used.  The \u201Cpsi\u201D appears to be monotype corsiva bold,
  which was then made bold again.  (or, as Mike Yanega of Bowfin Printworks pointed
  out to me, it might have been made bolder using stroke thickness).  The \u201Csystem
  engineers\u201D is myriad pro bold italic with a tracking (extension) of about 133%.
  \ I\u2019m about 90% sure of these results, but could very well be wrong \u2013
  I\u2019m not  a designer, I\u2019m a marketing person!\r\n\r\nFor the life of me,
  I cannot identify the font used for \u201CPrimary Systems Inc.\u201D \u2013 it\u2019s
  obviously a san serif type, with an unusual \u201CY\u201D with uneven arms, and
  variable thickness in the type.  I certainly don\u2019t have it on Adobe Illustrator
  and haven\u2019t been able to find anything like it on-line.\r\n\r\nSo 2 questions.
  \ Can anyone identify the font for Primary Systems Inc.? and does this logo work
  for an engineering firm?"

    not actually the right person to say if this is appropriate for a engineering
    firm... but the overall feeling is like it's designed from the engineers themselves
    and not from a graphic artist.\r\n\r\n=> \"psi\" dot is out of balance\r\n=> The
    high contrast (line thickness variance) between the \"psi\" and \"PRIMARY SYSTEMS
    INC\" makes it inappropriate for small scale sizes\r\n=> The Blue/Gray transition
    on the lower band is totally optically unbalanced relative to the \"System Engineers\"
    words\r\n\r\nand take into account that I'm just a computer programmer... \r\nI'm
    sure that a trained graphic artist eye will discover even more flaws.\r\n\r\nHaving
    done the same mistake myself, my advice is to hire a professional graphic designer
    to re-design your logo (probably by keeping some basic elements or colors, if
    you want to keep a connection to the old one)."
