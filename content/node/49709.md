  body: 'A novel, The Diary of Lady Willoughby, published in 1844. It was the first
    revival of Caslon, and I believe the first revival of any type. Updike called
    it "the chief typographic event of the mid-nineteenth century." Perhaps an exaggeration,
    as Updike was so biased in favor of Caslon. However, it was well known, and helped,
    I believe, lead to the revival of old style types generally. So it was influential.
    It is quite a handsome book, but I don''t think it would make the top of the list
    for its design, but rather for the revival of Caslon, and Old Style type generally.  '
