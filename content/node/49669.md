  recording copyright symbol</a> or Phonogram symbol wormed its way into our hearts
  or at least into Unicode 2117. Did \u2117 catch on? I've never seen a single \u2117
  in use yet I keep makin' em . . . like a \u2117 machine pounding out \u2117 after
  \u2117, week after week.\r\n\r\n"

    for Copyright.  I'm not sure what you mean by the question as to whether it caught
    on.  I've done a fair few CD designs (including my own latest album recently)
    and I've always included this symbol, and I'm sure nearly all my CDs have this
    symbol, so I'm surprised you haven't seen it.\r\n\r\nJH"
