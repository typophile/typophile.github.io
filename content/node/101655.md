  body: "To my eye it doesn't feel like it. They are alike in a lot of details, perhaps
    more than warranted, and definitely hovers on the borderline, but to me it's less
    of a case than classics like Helvetica/Arial and Frutiger/Myriad. I mean, even
    such a construction-intrinsic factor as contrast is different. \r\n\r\nThat of
    course does not exclude the possibility that one (in the spirit of open source)
    has borrowed and modified outlines from the other. Open Sans does feel more polished,
    with better proportions and more even color and application of ideas. "

  body: Both see extensive usage as webfonts and in this capacity they look noticeably
    different, especially in smaller sizes. Open Sans generally looks and feels lighter
    and more squarish in glyph shape compared to Droid Sans that looks heavier and
    narrower. Again, this is in smaller sizes (up to 18px) and on screen.

    great only in all caps and up to a certain size. Obviously a subjective opinion,
    so take it as such.\r\n\r\nOpen Sans is less finicky when it comes to getting
    it render well as a webfont kit. You can basically get a .ttf, feed it into the
    FontSquirrel generator and the kit that comes out will just work. If you do the
    same with Droid Sans, it will render substantially worse in smaller sizes compared
    to the version hosted on Google Fonts. This sort of \"finicky\"."
