    probably just the designer who did it, I don&#39;t  <BR>think it&#39;s a feature
    in the font. Unless it&#39;s a bug... <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"

  body: 'There is a very good chance you will never find this font, because such fonts
    can be made by anyone. The way the baseline bounces all over suggests this one
    was made by someone who was either new to this skill, or wanted to create a font
    that looks unskilled. I looked through the booklet of 300 handwritten fonts that
    came with the ClickArt CD about 8 years ago, since these fonts have a way of popping
    up all over, but this was not one of them. However, I think any number of them
    could be used as substitutes, and they can all be found on the web under various
    names. Step 1: Look at the fonts in <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html"
    target="_blank"> Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> for something that has
    a similar feel, or quality that you like about this one.  Step 2: if the name
    has an &#39;HW&#39; in it,  look that font up in the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/HWFontAliases.html"
    target="_blank">HW Font Alias List</a> . &#40;This list tells the names these
    ClickArt fonts were renamed to by WSi so that they could sell them as their own
    fonts&#41;. Finally, Step 3: When you find out the Alias name, you can download
    the renamed font <a href="http://iquebec.ifrance.com/jeannine/6fontpolice.htm"
    target="_blank">here</a>. As far as the &#39;1&#39; for &#39;I&#39; switch, all
    you need to do is type the 1 instead of the I, with any of these fonts.'
