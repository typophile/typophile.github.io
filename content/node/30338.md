  body: I believe that the OpenType capabilities of CS3 have yet to be released. All
    the info on ID CS3 available can be found <a href=http://quarkvsindesign.com/articles/a1/features/2006/sneak-peek-indesign-cs3/>here</a>.
    But I am interested -- what are some of the features that ID lacks?

  body: "It also supports \"Caps to small caps\" (c2sc) and \"case\" (case).\r\n\r\nYou
    get c2sc combined with Small Caps when you click on \"All Small Caps\"\r\n\r\n\"case\"
    is implemented by \"All Caps\"."

  body: Thanks, Arno. I never knew how many features there are. I'd love to see automatic
    Capital Spacing, for example, so I'm with you now.

    built into the case feature, which is currently supported as Nick described above."

  body: Oh. I stand corrected. Since my pseudo-obscure mention of a feature didn't
    work out, I'd <em>love</em> to see contextual petite cap swashes and randomized
    nukta forms. Is that so much to ask?

  body: "Actually, InDesign supports 'cpsp' (capital spacing) and 'case' alternates,
    both of which are activated by clicking on \"all caps\" formatting.\r\n\r\nInDesign
    also supports 'kern'.  :)\r\n\r\nHowever, everyone who knows the answer to your
    question about CS3 features is under a nondisclosure agreement with Adobe and
    can't talk about it yet. In my case, it's part of my employment contract.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
