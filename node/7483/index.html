  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Dear all: <BR> <BR>I don't want to start a quarrel here, but I'd like to have Akzidenz-Grotesque by LINOTYPE. This is a discontinued font. <BR> <BR>I'm trying to get if on behalf of a friend who is doing a marvelous job in creating non Western fonts for academic work. <BR> <BR>Here is what he wrote to me: <BR> <BR>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <BR>As far as the Akzidenz-Grotesk is concerned, I need only ONE example of ANY font alled &quot;Akzidenz-Grotesk&quot; and contained in any disk or CD from **Linotype**. The important point is: <BR>The file must be from **Linotype**, not from Berthold etc. <BR>This means, if someone has ANY older Linotype Library Gold CD on which the Akzidenz-Grotesk is contained, then I would need ONE example, preferable the Roman style of Akzidenz-Grotesk. <BR>Since Font Explorer 1.5 Gold Edition = Linotype Library Gold CD the Akzidenz-Grotesk was no longer sold by Linotype, so that it must be a Linotype font collection older than year 2000. <BR>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; <BR> <BR>Since it is a discontinued font, I think there is no problem in his getting it. If someone can send such a copy it would be appreciated.  <BR> <BR>I don't think this is breaking whatever law there is, but then I'm not a lawyer. I mean to offend no one's feelings on this hot matter. But just bear in mind that the person on behalf of which I'm asking this is doing extremely important academic work: providing fonts for working with old and very important texts.  <BR> <BR>I hope I will not be missinterpreted.  <BR> <BR>Rodrigo de S</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rodrigo,  <BR> <BR>your informations are not accurate. Linotype's version of Akzidenz Grotesk is not discontinued, it's renamed. Linotype's version of Akzidenz Grotesk is now called Basic Commercial: <a href="http://www.linotype.com/114/basiccommercial-family.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.linotype.com/114/basiccommercial-family.html">http://www.linotype.com/114/basiccommercial-family.html</a></a>  <BR> <BR>The fact that the font under the particular name and in a particular version is discontinued does not authorize anybody to share it. It is still copyrighted. Bitstream's versions of ITC fonts are no longer on sale, and yet the unauthorized distribution of them is certainly illegal.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dear Adam; <BR> <BR>Yes, perhaps that is illegal. But surely there would have been an impasse here: if it were discontinued how could one buy it? For someone who has it and after selling would keep a copy? <BR> <BR>And what about, for instance, the old Berthold fonts? Berthold, as far as I know, went bankrupt. If I wish to have a Berthold font is it illegal to someone to give it to me? Perhaps it is, but how could one get it in such a case? <BR> <BR>I understand the need to pay for fonts. I purchased a lot of them. I won't just pilfer them. But in the case I presented, I believe I am doing nothing ethically (as distinct from legally) wrong. <BR> <BR>This, of course, is open to debate, but I follow ethics, not blind law. Law is meant to further ethics, but it is not ethics. When law is blatantly wrong (as in the case of Berthold fonts, should it decree that I am not at liberty to copy it) I am quite willing to break it, as I am doing no harm to anyone.  <BR> <BR>Dear Thomas: <BR> <BR>No, I think he really needs the Akzidenz-Grotesk as a bases to make foreign alphabets. Anyway, I don't exactly know, or am not sure I am at liberty to say, but it seems to me to be a worthy cause.  <BR> <BR>Let me assure you that by stating what I believe is right I mean no disrespect from those who think otherwise; everyone is entitled to his/her opinion.  <BR> <BR>Thanks for the answers, <BR> <BR>Rodrigo de S</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Isn't it true that, when we pay for a font, technically we're not &quot;buying&quot; we're &quot;licensing&quot; &ndash; and therein lies an interesting difference. I can draw a picture of Spider Man, but I couldn't sell prints without purchasing a license. Having the picture of Spidey is okay. Trying to make money with it is not okay. <BR> <BR>So then, why couldn't Rodrigo's friend have a copy of the font as long as he didn't use it for commercial use? <BR> <BR>I see no moral reason why this should not be the case.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">He'd have to buy it from somebody who is willing to give up their copy. (For him to sell it but keep a copy is a particularly unwelcome form of piracy.) This is not much different from buying a car or a set of dishes that is no longer being made, except that breaking the law is easier with digital goods. <BR> <BR>The Berthold version is still available. You can find the current incarnation of Berthold at <a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com">http://www.bertholdtypes.com</a></a> <BR> <BR>As for using the font as a basis for making new fonts, unfortunately most licenses prohibit modifying the font that has been licensed. I gather Linotype's is in that category. So even if it were still available from Linotype, your friend couldn't do what he wants with it. <BR> <BR>I'm not a lawyer of course, but these things seem like pretty clear violations of license agreements and copyright laws in most of the world. People are entitled to whatever opinions they want, but as far as I know legal systems do not generally recognize having a different opinion as a basis for breaking the law or violating a contract. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rodrigo, I'm sorry to say that would you are asking for would be a EULA violation. Linotype Akzidenz Grotesk, as Adam pointed out, was never discontinued. The font files were just renamed. <BR> <BR>Someone who has purchased a Gold CD from Linotype may not sell, or give individual font files to anyone else for any reason that is not delineated in their EULA (so, anything other than co-workers or service bureaus, etc.). That would be a EULA violation.  <BR> <BR>One the other hand, If someone had bought the old Akzidenz or new Basic Commercial as an &quot;individual font file&quot; from our web shop, they could transfer that license to you or to your friend, but they could not just give you the font. They would have to delete their own copy then as well. Anything else would be both illegal and immoral, because you would be getting something that you didn't rightfully pay for. <BR> <BR>Linotype Akzidenz Grotesk and Basic Commercial will remain licensed products of Linotype's parent company Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG as long as Linotype and/or their parent company exist as coprporate entities. <BR> <BR>Berthold Types in Chicago holds itself to be the legal successor company of H. Berthold AG. So, if you acquire an old Berthold font illegally, the new Berthold Types could still be justified in pursuing you as far as I know, because you WOULD be violating a EULA condition of their's, even if don't believe it! <BR> <BR>Rodrigo, I would encourage you, or your friend, to just buy a copy of Basic Commercial from Linotype! A single weight just costs $22. Surely that isn't too much to pay for such a renowned design. <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/114/basiccommercial-family.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.linotype.com/114/basiccommercial-family.html">http://www.linotype.com/114/basiccommercial-family.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>That your friend only want to use the font for private or academic pursuits is unfortunately not a factor in purchasing decisions. You need to purchase a license for a font in order to use it on your computer, not just to create commercial work for clients. <BR> <BR>I work at Linotype, and would be happy to answer any more licensing questions that you might have. You can contact me at any time offline, if you'd like.</div>

I think it's absurd to take such a strict viewpoint on an unpurchasable typeface. <BR> <BR>My opinion is that being so tight-assed <i>encourages</i> piracy. Being cool encourages compliance. <BR> <BR>I know &quot;font collectors&quot; &ndash; at least one of which is a regular here, and I'm not talking about me &ndash; who seek out multiple &amp;/or obsolescent variants of fonts for their collection. Say, Myriad MM &ndash; they have no intention of ever using said font, they just want it. If they were to use a font in their collection for commercial work, they would immediately purchase a license. <BR> <BR>That, in my opinion, is completely harmless &ndash; and in fact <i>promotes</i> licensing in a try-before-you-buy sort of way. Trying to suppress that sort of activity is pointless and self-defeating. As the music industry has discovered, it is absolutely impossible to stop without liberalizing their business model or launching a few thousand lawsuits. <BR> <BR>I know this is rehashing old arguments, but this discussion highlights what I think are some of the more unreasonable aspects of the EULA structure. <BR> <BR>Being overly strict just drive people to Kazaa and Limewire, where they can download the Font Folio (or whatever) any time they want.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>I think it's absurd to take such a strict viewpoint on an unpurchasable typeface.</i> <BR> <BR>As Dan and others have noted, Akzidenz-Grotesk is not an unpurchasable typeface. <BR> <BR>The Tiro Typeworks' Type 1 retail fonts &ndash; 1530 Garamond, Manticore, Aeneas, Academia &ndash; <i>are</i> unpurchasable typefaces, so may make a useful example in discussion. We have withdrawn these fonts from the market and have no immediate plans to rerelease them in any format, so they will remain unpurchasable for some time, perhaps forever. Does this mean that people who have licenses for these fonts can share the fonts with other people in contravention of the original license agreement? No, it does not. The sale of the fonts has been discontinued, not the terms of existing license agreements. These fonts are the intellectual property of the designers, who have a moral and legal right to determine how, when and <i>whether</i> they are distributed. The fonts have been withdrawn from distribution for a reason: we don't want to sell them any more because we don't want them to be more widely used than they already are. If withdrawing them from distribution meant that anyone could freely pass them around, what would be the frigging point of withdrawing them? I take a very strict view on these unpurchasable typefaces.</div>

This doesn't have to be an acrimonious struggle, and I'm very happy to talk about a reasonable balance in the pricing and licensing of fonts to end users (much more happy than I am to explain to a reseller that I'm not interested in the 20% royalties he wants to pay me in order to profit from my work).

I think you are the one who is being unfair in insisting that all fonts should be licensed under identical terms, regardless of the nature of the font or its distribution. As William Blake wrote, one law for the lion and the ox is tyranny. One of the things you and I usually seem to agree on is that things are usually more complex than simplistic explanations or responses will allow. I think this is also true of font licensing, and if you want decency from the people who make fonts then you also need to show them decency, by asking for the things you want and, if they are not forthcoming, not just grabbing them.</div>

It's just very rare, and the language of such clauses even more rarely corresponds to reality, to treating fellow humans decently.</i> <BR> <BR>Well, that seems a basic function of typical legalese. I went to some length to write the old Tiro EULA in plain English and to stress the ways in which respecting the EULA protected the user's investment, which is among other things an investment in the value of something that not everyone else has. <BR> <BR><i>Because a few months ago when I claimed that only MS had such a clause, Simon pointed out that in fact most houses had it (at that point).</i> <BR> <BR>I don't recall Si saying that most font houses have this clause. In any case, I don't think it has ever been the case. Many font houses follow Adobe's lead, which has always been to allow modification. <BR> <BR>What I do recall Si saying, which is also the point I have made whenever the MS EULA comes up, is that,  excepting the rather special and generous case of the web fonts, MS <i>do not have a EULA for fonts</i>. Fonts distributed by MS are covered by the EULAs of the software packages with which they are bundled. The no-mod clause applied to fonts is simply that of the prohibition on decompiling or reverse engineering of the operating system, word processor, or what-have-you software. Microsoft, until now at least, have not singled out fonts in their software EULAs. <BR> <BR>I think it is important to distinguish between fonts that are licensed directly in a retail market, and fonts that are bundled with software. I think the no-mod clause makes a lot of sense in the latter case, whether fonts are singled out in the EULA or not. MS is not a 'font house' in the sense that even Adobe is, let alone Agfa Monotype, Linotype, Emigre, House Industries, Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones, etc.</div>

That doesn't change the font software at all. That is OK. Although, sometimes, it makes individual typeface designer sad that their letters didn't work for you <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> &amp;gt;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, but I don't get it then. In terms of intelectual property or authoring, I don't see the reason for one being allowed to modify the font shape but not the software. Although I understand it may generate the mentioned problems (corrupted files, problems with customer service, etc), but that's not author's protection, just avoiding annoyance. <BR>As in the link Hrant posted. The girl was violating MS' user agreement just by modifying the font; the fact that she opened the file and edited it (because she wanted to tweak some letters) was a crime, right? Even if she if she would never use  it, be it personally OR commercially. <BR> <BR>But if she had set all her text in the same font, created outlines out of it and edited the outlines to fit her needs, then she would be able to do anything and would be not breaking the agreement? <BR> <BR>What, then, is being protected?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, can you answer this? You could definitely word it better that I can. <BR> <BR>Gabriel, most type foundries, at least the large ones, allow you to modify fonts anyway as long as you don't try to sell them to anyone else as you own work. So, this question isn't an enormous factor in the industry anymore. <BR> <BR>What is protected is the data that makes font work. Once you are using the font legitimately for its intended purpose (designing in a computer application), you can do pretty much whatever you want with it. That is fair use. <BR> <BR>Thinking about fair use is a good topic for further discussion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It seemed to me that last year as I emailed the various foundries to varify the information which Nathan and I had gathered changes were occuring. This was last year (October-January). I like to think that some changes came about because of my little essay. But mostly I'm just happy that the conversation was happening. Designers should not be afraid to voice their concerns with EULAs. But, at the same time designers need to respect the EULAs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Further, if you buy ITC Bodoni from Myfonts, you are given the Linotype license you refer to, and it allows read-only embedding AND design mods, while Stone Type's EULA does not allow modifications! <BR> <BR>I should note that ITC's site includes smallcaps in the albeit higher price, while the other vendors do not, so that's a trade off one has to make against their EULA. <BR> <BR>Still, I think the End User might be justified in feeling a little cheated if he purchased form Stone or Linotype. The limitations of the EULA aren't exactly featured when browsing for type, and one could easily slip up and buy from the wrong place.</div>
