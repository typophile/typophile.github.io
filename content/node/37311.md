  machines. I came across an 'Intertype Parts and Accessories' book from 1957 which
  I bought. However, I can find very little information relating to these [[Intertype]]
  machines. The title page says 'Intertype Company \u2014 A division of Harris-Intertype
  Corporation, Brooklyn, New York.' I believe Linotype was founded in New York which
  me think that the two were somehow related.\r\n\r\nWas Intertype a subsidiary of
  either Monotype or Linotype? If not did it have much commercial success, and what
  were the reasons for introducing this new machine when Linotype and Monotype were
  already so dominant? Did it offer any benefits or technical progressions over the
  Linotype/Monotype machines?\r\n\r\nAny information you can offer would be greatly
  appreciated. \r\n\r\n\u2014Phil"

    machine invented. It marks the beginning of the Cold Type era and is the machine
    responsible for it . . . Incidentally this is the machine that inspired the creation
    of the Filmotype by its inventor Allan Friedman when he saw it unveiled to US
    audiences in 1948.\r\n\r\nInstead of lead slugs, the Intertype which was a Linotype
    machine had replaced them with small film negatives and proceeded to set type
    as you would imagine the bastardization of a lead type and photo type machine
    only could.\r\n\r\nThere are several great articles about the Fotosetter and some
    Googling is well advised but to help round out the picture for you, imagine the
    benefit a typesetter or printer gained when going from lugging around cases of
    lead slugs weighing many pounds to an entire alphabet that could be held in hand.\r\n\r\nThere
    are many reasons Cold Type caught on and it became the standard some time after
    that period till digital typesetting machines like the Alphatype came into their
    own. It wasn't until the release of the first MacIntosh in 1984 when Cold Type
    was eclipsed by desktop publishing . . .\r\n\r\nLet me know if you dig up some
    nice images of the Fotosetter!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nStuart :D"

  body: Intertype was a rival to Linotype and competed in the same markets. A number
    of popular newspaper text faces were developed by Intertype, including Imperial
    and Ideal.

  body: "For what it is worth, there was also a machine called a Linograph [I think].
    This was cheaper than Linotype or Intertype machines and could run mats from both
    those machines. I only know of this because it was invented and developed here
    in the upper Midwest. I have not had time to look into it more deeply.\r\n\r\nThis
    might be an interesting topic for someone delving into the history of hot-metal
    machine composition.\r\n\r\npowers"

    I have some really nice illustrations of the Intertype machines, and some amusing
    adverts which attempt to convince printers of the supposed benefits of \r\nthe
    Intertype without much subtlety. When I get some time I will post them up here.\r\n\r\n\u2014Phil"

    research? Here is a link to photos of the tour I took of the Intertype Corporation
    factory back in the sixties. I was an Intertype machine operator (typesetter,
    \"comp,\" etc.) for fifteen years.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.coutant.org/intertype/\r\n\r\nThose
    are my photos; I took them. As far as I am concerned, you are free to use them
