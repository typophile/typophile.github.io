    era).\r\n\r\nThe lettering appears to be based on an old woodtype style called
    Latin:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/latin/\r\n\r\nSome digital typefaces

  body: "AFAIK nobody has made this lettering into a font.\r\nThe capital letters
    are fairly standard Roman letters with pulled out serifs. Fonts that include this
    feature include Ronaldson [img:sites/default/files/old-images/RonaldsonAsTMW_5765.gif]

    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiffany/\r\nThe other letters are an unusual
    mix of roman letters with big ball terminals and sloped letters. For some ideas

    we ignore the rugged edge effect, are there any more suggestions as to substitutes
