  body: This was probably not made with a font, but by hand. So an exact match won't
    be possible. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/mvb_fonts/mvb_solano_gothic_retro_bold_ot/">MVB
    Solano Gothic</a> may be your closest match.

  body: 'This is on a window, and the other type used was Tyler, which is much more
    elaborate. I assume that the artist would use a font for both. But perhaps you
    are right. However, the artwork in question predates the existence of MVB Solano.
    Though, apart from the E, it is quite close. '
