<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>The newest edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary boasts some 16,000 changes, all pertaining to the hyphen. It has either been omitted and the words left as two separate entities (ice cream), or the two words have been joined into one (pigeonhole). The AP is running a story which blames the internet and cell phones; and modern design.
"Another factor in the hyphen's demise is designers' distaste for its ungainly horizontal bulk between words."
So what do you think, typophiles? Is the hyphen dated and unattractive or just misunderstood by an eager-to-communicate generation?
The AP story can be found [[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070921/od_nm/britain_hyphen1_dc;_ylt=ArHzlsg3leMV5A86tgZvZuqs0NUE|here]].</div>

<div class=commentbody>I never understand why hyphens (and thus hyphenation) are found to be so ugly or bad.
I have no problem with hyphens and hyphenation in texts, in my eyes they are not unattractive.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I remember learning from Strunk and White's <em>Elements of Style</em> that "the steady evolution of the language seems to favor union: two words eventually become one, usually after a period of hyphenation."
As for the rejection of the hyphen on aesthetic grounds, I started a <a ref=http://www.typophile.com/node/28902>thread</a> to disprove that a while ago!</div>

<div class=commentbody>The hyphen is not likely to go out of fashion when used as you thoughtfully illustrated with "eager-to-communicate generation." That is, hyphenating is an accepted (and, some would argue, requisite) method of identifying a <strong>group of words</strong>--one or more of which is <em>not</em> an adjective--used as a group adjectivally.</div>

<div class=commentbody>By the way, I don't think changes to the way we might communicate nearly obsolete terms like "pin money" and "hobby horse" can be pinned on the internet & celphone generation...</div>

<div class=commentbody>I tend to agree with the thinkers at Oxford on this one. Hyphenates were a fashion that failed to stick, and hanging on to them can be pretentious.
I also agree with Nick—hyphenated phrases are a good way to identify words used as a group adjectivally. They’re especially useful for making hasty internet communication more comprehensible.</div>

<div class=commentbody>A hyphen might not qualify as a pigeonhole*, reports of its death are premature, still used for compound adjectives and it has migrated. The second thing I do when preparing a text provided by an author for setting is to search and replace spacehyphenspace to spaceenspace (I know this a British use, presumably something similar is required to accommodate other uses); the first is to replace double word spaces. The main concern for designers is, I believe, the other use of hyphens – to break a word over two lines and to avoid ladders.
*5. Typogr. An excessively wide space between two words. Now rare.

Craig, your link doesn’t work for me.
James, were they ever a fashion?

<div class=commentbody>Hyphenation dates back far, far before the beginning of mechanical type in the mid-15th century. It can hardly be called a "fashion." More like a fundamental in correct typesetting.
