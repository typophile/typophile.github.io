body: "hello,\r\n\r\nas a part of my architectural studies at the university of darmstadt
  in germany, i'm currently working on an analysis of the relationship of typography
  and space and character of a city and the impact they have on each other.\r\nmy
  main emphasis so far is:\r\n:: how much a city's type (ci) represents its charcter,
  and/or space\r\n:: can one type represent the many different charcters and atmospheres
  most modern citys include in their metropolitain area?\r\n:: how much does a type
  named after a city represent the city, what is the inspiration for the name?\r\n::
  are there other ways of creating a city's typography?\r\n:: does a city have a certain
  typographical style? in the signs? in the graffiti?\r\n...\r\ni'd be happy about
  any comment, link and every other bit of information, that would help me gather
  information on this subject!\r\n\r\nbj\xF6rn asmussen"

    History of Letters</em> (London, 2004), chap. 9, on the London Underground. That's
    fourteen pages on one aspect of the typography of one city, so producing a study
    about the typography of all cities in the world would probably be either overly
    large or overly generalized. You might want to narrow your project. Good luck!"

      at the start of my research!)is not to analyse each and every city and its typographic
      applications. my aim is to generate an overview of possible ways of dealing
      with citys to generate a certain typography. based on this information i want
      to focus on the relation of space and typography (an the other way around, as
      in buildings and citys based on letters f.e. the alphabet city by paul noble).\r\nor
      in other words: what does it need to transform space into typography and typography
      into (usable/interesting)space."

    into (usable/interesting)space.</em>\r\n\r\nI generally think of typography in
    2-dimensions and architecture in 3-dimentions. But I did study architectonics
    under <a href=\"http://www.ArchitectureWeek.com/2003/0108/design_1-1.html\" target=\"new\"><strong>John
    Hejduk</strong></a> who was more a poet visionary than a brick-and-mortar architect.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I've always felt that Antoni Gaud\xED's <a href=\"http://www.GreatBuildings.com/buildings/Casa_Batllo.html\"
    target=\"new\">Casa Batll\xF3</a> in Barcelona was as textured as Catalan manuscripts,
    if that's what you mean.\r\n"

    body: "hey norbert,\r\ni think architecture and typographie have very much in
      common. they both deal with interior space, the shape and its expression -letter/house-,
      as well as the relation of the shapes to each other. -kerning/city-\r\nbesides,
      both try to communicate at least one additional dimension and they are generally
      published in 2D."
