  the words \"VITAL SPEECHES,\" and I'm drawing a blank. It's not:\r\n\r\n- Caslon
  Openface\r\n- any of the Handtooled families from ITC (Century, Garamond, Cheltenham)\r\n-
  Acanthus Open\r\n- Narcissus \r\n- Academy Engraved\r\n- Monotype Old Face\r\n\r\nThe
  A is one of the distinctive characters.\r\n\r\n(And yes, I know that the TA pair
  needs to be kerned, and that \"of the day\" is Trajan.)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vital_speeches_4976.jpg]"
