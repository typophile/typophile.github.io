body: "I've been working on the latest addition to my Aviano family for a few weeks
  now. Aviano Modern is a Didone. It is supposed to convey \"luxurious power\" and
  is intended for titling and logotypes. The letterforms widths are based on a classical
  model, unlike most Didones, to fit with the rest of the Aviano family. I am planning
  five weights. You see three in the preview below, thin, regular and black. \r\n\r\nPrior
  members of the Aviano series here: http://new.myfonts.com/search/aviano/fonts/\r\n\r\nWhat
  are your thoughts on the name? I've always thought of these as Moderns but Didone
  seems more popular these days. Is the average designer familiar with that term or
  is modern still more recognizable?\r\n\r\nThank you for your comments,\r\n\r\nJDooley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avmodern_4780.png]"

  body: Considering that "modern" can mean anything opposed to "antique", I think
    that Aviano Didone would be more recognizable. But I can be wrong, you are the
    best-seller guy. :)

    more useful, I can see the reasons for both alternatives.\r\n\r\nDoes M look a
    bit too wide? And J descend a bit low?? (Not an expert at all, just those letters
    struck me)\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm with Ricardo. I'd really like to see a move away from terms that have
    ambiguous ties to a period. Modern, post-modern, antiqua, oldstyle figures are
    all prone to misinterpretation. I would go with Didone or Serif.

  body: I agree with Ricardo and Stewf. But Aviano Didone doesn't roll off the tongue
    very well.

  body: "I think I will go with Aviano Didone. Thank you all for your opinions. Truly,
    it doesn't roll off the tongue, but it should work well enough. Also, Aviano Modern
    might cause some confusion with some extensions to the line I plan in the future.\r\n\r\nBen,
    you are right on the m. I didn't initially think so, but I played with it a bit
    and found you are correct. The new M is about 5-10% less in width. I made an alternate
    for the J that doesn't descend at all. The J has a very sharp ending to have it
    conform with other characters. I experimented with a few options, but I like this
    the best. There will be a ball terminal alt for it.\r\n\r\nBarry, great suggestion.
    I considered as I like the feeling it invokes it but it would break my naming
    scheme.\r\n\r\nI've got some more coming, including 50 ligatures and alternates.
    I've got some ball terminal alternates for all glyphs that can accept them, art
    deco inspired alternates, and some swash descender alts. Just putting on a few
    final touches, but I wanted to thank you all for your input. Any more suggestions
    or comments on the overall design?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJeremy Dooley\r\nwww.insignedesign.com"

  body: "Sounds nice, all the ligs and alternates :)\r\nSomething about V makes me
    vaguely think the apex looks too far left? Possibly Y as well??\r\nDid you know
    there's a tiny overlap where the crossbar of A meets the left diagonal (on regular
    and black)?\r\nU has a nice curve.\r\nI'm wondering what other possibilities might
    exist in the Aviano family...?"

    minor optical corrections. I'll knock out the overlaps on compilation. More coming
    tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI have a whole list of ideas for the Aviano series. A semi sans
    is probably next 1Q '10. Down the road I have everything from a futuristic variant
    to Tuscan.\r\n\r\nJeremy Dooley\r\nwww.insignedesign.com"

  body: "Ooh, how exciting! What a nice family that will make!\r\n\r\nA final observation:
    the crossbar of T looks slightly not wide enough...perhaps the arms need to be
    longer to capture more counterspace underneath?? I'm a bit guessing though so
    you should trust your judgment on this, not mine ;)"

  body: "Ben,\r\n\r\nYou are correct, the T is tricky. In the past I've made them
    wide to match proportions of other letterforms, but the crossbar in that instance
    looked wider than the character was tall! I've nudged it out a bit since the first
    sample.\r\n\r\nY'all, its your last chance to get your licks in! Give me your
    comments :).\r\n\r\nJeremy Dooley\r\nwww.insignedesign.com\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aviano-Didone-Sample-Page-Source_5422.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aviano-Didone-Poster-4_6114.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aviano-Didone-Poster-2_5728.png]\r\n\r\n"

    cap X looks sheared to the right...not sure if it's too much offset or the hairline
    needs to be steeper. AV may need a hair more kerning (it's fine at the top but
    looks a bit too spaced above the eagle?)\r\nI love all your different eagles :) "
