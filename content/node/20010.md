  because I was sure I can fix it myself but it doesn't work..\r\n\r\nSome characters
  like single quote, double quote etc. are not being displayed even though \u201Cthey
  are there\u201D \u2013 when I open the font data (windows ttf) in fontographer or
  font creator they are there where they're supposed to be but when I use the typeface
  in a program (anything from indesign to fireworks) it shows those rectangles reserved
  for missing characters.\r\n\r\nPlease help, I have no experience and therefore no
  clue what to look at. The typeface is this one: http://www.dafont.com/dev-gothic.font
  (I know, shouldn't have messed with free type but this one suited me better than
  any other and the project is zero profit)."

  body: "the font only contains the neutral single quote and double quotes, but does
    not have the proper single and double quotation marks so your application is probably
    using 'smart quotes' and substituting the neutral quotes for proper quotes (which
    don't exist) or you are trying to use the characters x2018..x201D, but you only
    have the ascii quotes x0022 and x0027.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/charset_4512.gif]"

    body: "I see..\r\nbut it is somehow impossible to use the neutral quotes in InDesign.
      Even if I copy them from the character map and paste in, InDesign switches to
      proper typographic quotations (which don't exist). It would be better to use
      the proper ones anyway even with a decorative typeface like this, so I'll try
      to build some. From which program is your screenshot, bu the way?\r\n\r\nAnd
      thank you very much!"

    if you deselect the option \"Use Typographer's Quotes\" in the Preferences.\r\n\r\nThat
    screenshot is from [[FontLab]] (on Windows)."

    body: "This is a late reply, but unfortunately it does replace the straight quotes
      when you paste from another application into Indesign even if \"Use Typographer's
      Quotes\" is deselected. This is a maddening bug when you have to use a typeface
      for Hebrew, Greek, or any other language where typographer's quote represents
      a completely different vowel or breathing. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has a solution
      I'd be glad to know what it is."
