body: "I'm frustrated. Every time I open a new document in InDesign, all the units
  revert to Picas. I don't use Picas (maybe someday, but doubtful). Does anyone know
  how to reset the default document so I can change the units to inches instead?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  while I'm at it, I might as well change some other preferences. Anyone want to make
  a suggestion on other things I should probably change, maybe the baseline grid and
  increments.\r\n\r\n"
