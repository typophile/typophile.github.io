  body: "Great article!\r\n\r\nBut why write an article about the road to the superb
    <em>Williams Caslon</em>, and then set it in Scala?\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: I Just discovered
    that it is a global setting. Nonetheless it would be nice to see the article set
    in a Williams Caslon web font... JMHO"

  body: "Thanks, Adam!  John Boardly at \"I love typography\" is now implementing
    the new web type possibilities, which I really like. Fontfont, which publishes
    Scala, has been early out of the box with web type, but Font Bureau it seems will
    soon join the move web with [[http://www.webtype.com/|webtype]]. I designed it
    for high resolution, but the fact that Caslon has been printed with success in
    so many different processes over the centuries does make me very curious how it
    will adapt to the web. \r\n\r\nps Scala does look pretty good on the web :)  "
