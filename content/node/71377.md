body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am looking for a vintage looking typeface, similar to the one
  above. I am not worried about it being distressed, but want it to have an Victorian/early
  20th century feel. Certainly serifed, and with similar line thicknesses (as seen
  on the A).\r\n\r\nIt doesn't have to be shadowed either, as can add that if required...\r\n\r\nSo
  far the closest I have found is: ITC Quorum BT, but am looking for more suitable
  options.\r\n\r\nI maybe that I end up hand drawing it, but would like a base font
  to alter.\r\n\r\nAny help, suggestions, or places to look(such as specific library's/books)
  would be great.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: Should also add it is going to be a display face (for a logo), ideally in
    upper and lower case, with a few different cuts... this is in the ideal world,
    and accept that might not be possible!

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nJust a quick update- This ticks most of the boxes, might tweak
    a little, add swashes etc, but pretty darn good!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/confection.php\r\n\r\nCant
    download it till im back home, as I need to buy it when my IP address and my billing
    address match, which wont be for a month. Bit outdated, but guess its an anti
    piracy measure.\r\n\r\nThank you to you both.\r\n\r\nDavid"
