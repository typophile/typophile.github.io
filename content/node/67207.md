  body: "You don\u2019t need all those anyway. I find the process of looking for something
    specific to fit my task(s) almost as exciting as the design itself. Studying both
    online specimens and printed specimens, looking up opinions and reviews, all in
    order to get a feel for how the typeface will preform. \r\n\r\nOr, you could just
    waste your hours surfing Dafont: we don\u2019t really care."
