  body: "I like the feel of this! Interesting design. \r\nJust remember that those
    sharp corners and points, and details like the top of the \"t\", will not come
    out as sharp (and not exactly the same anyway) in a tattoo &ndash; and then continue
    to blur for the rest of the subject's life. How large is this going to be?\r\nDepending
    on intended size, I'd say don't be too \"sophisticated\" in the micro details.
    Like, I might strengthen the crossbars of the \"t\"s, and not let the top left
    of \"i\" and \"t\" taper into a point, but make it a bit blunter. \r\n\r\nDoes
    the \"i\" need more overshoot on the x-line?\r\nAlso, the tittle looks a bit shy
    and awkward rather than full of intent to me.\r\n\r\nFunny with the ball terminal
    on the \"e\", but you might want to fiddle some more with it, its rotation and
    oblong-ity seems a bit uncomfortable. Have you tried a lachrymal?\r\nThe \"e\"
    might also look like it's leaning forward? (But I haven't had enough coffee.)"

  body: I agree that a teardrop terminal on the e is worth trying; that letter's thins
    jump out a bit.

  body: "Thanks for your feedback. I've tried a lachrymal and also tweaked the ball
    terminal to fit more with the letter shape. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/intent-v2_4114.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
    going to wait and talk to the tattooist before thickening up the corners and thin
    strokes. "
