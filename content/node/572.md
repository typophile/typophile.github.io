  body: No, not a Storm font, but the font is <BR>viewable and downloadable on the
    internet. <BR> <BR> <BR> the hint is author. <BR> <BR> What author has been in
    the &#40;type&#41; <BR>news recently...Does that author have <BR>any type creations...do
    you, in fact, have <BR>this creation sitting a few mouse clicks away, <BR>tucked
    away in a folder you haven&#39;t opened <BR>this century? <BR> <BR>I think so.
    Strong possibility.

  body: Moye is correct. But wrong font. <BR>When you buy Fontographer, you also <BR>get
    a bunch of .fog files, including a handful of fonts <BR>digitized  by Stephen
    Moye. One of them is Goudy One Hundred. <BR>Another one is the typeface in question.
    <BR> <BR>It was released as a &#34;public domain&#34; font so it has ended <BR>up
    in some free font archives. <BR> <BR>Check your fogs or moorstation. It can be
    googled <BR>with the right keywords. <BR> <BR>bj

    <BR> <BR>A quick correction of sorts concerning the LA Times stuff from last week:
    <BR>The new body and headline fonts are indeed by FontBureau, but the really spiffy
    large section heads &#40;the ones BJ mentioned&#41; are a remake by Carter of
    his custom work for the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, now named &#34;Victoria&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>As you were. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
