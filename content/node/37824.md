  trick. my poor ipod just died today for several minutes before i was was able to
  resuscitate it with a good, solid thump. glad to know this tried-and-true method
  still works with all our sophisticated gadgetry. >^p'

  body: 'heh. it was a last-ditch effort, really. i didn''t feel like 1) shipping
    the thing to the states 2) having it fixed at approx the original cost 3) having
    it shipped back to the UK & 4) waiting in the meantime. '

  body: "I've used the blunt force method to resurrect several Macs and hard discs
    over the years (used to run a university lab full of 'em). When all else fails,
    the right amount of force applied to just the right spot can work wonders... or
    at least get you to a point where you can copy the files off.\r\n\r\nMy question
    is this: what do you think is the best/most creative use for a dead hard drive
    mechinism? I've toyed with the idea of explosives, and toilet bricks, but I'm
    looking for more interesting ways to destroy them (excuse me... \"recycle\" them)."

  body: "Paul,\r\nconsumer goods, especially high tech goodies like cell phones and
    iPods, the unit price is so cheap, and by comparison the cost of labor so high---having
    them serviced doesn't make much sense.\r\n\r\nScott,\r\nthe bearing of a hard
    drive collapses if the disk has done enough revolutions. A collapsed hard drive
    bearing makes a distinctive loud whining noise. When that happens it's time to
    get all the data off before it stops for good. Or if you hear that whining noise
    begin to develop it indicates a bearing on its way out. Hard drives also sometimes
    develop a condition known as \"stiction\"---a portemanteau word for static + friction.
    The simple cure for stiction is to pull the drive out, grasp it horizontally and
    give it an abrupt twist (in the horizontal plane) of your hand.\r\n\r\nTiffany,\r\n(much
    laughter) test load for a trebuchet, perfick! A mate of mine who makes computers
    calls a superseded computer a \"boat anchor\".\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
