  have the simplest of characters - - a broken bar - - it is the only glyph in the
  font that is causing me trouble. In one of the masters, the start point is different.
  How do I correct it? 'Make node first' doesn't seem to work. In the one troublesome
  master, the starting node is at 5/8 [2] instead of 1/8 [1]. The bar is two elements
  of four points each - - simple as possible. "

    macro in FLab, no?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nErnie\r\n"

  body: 'The problem is that there are two elements (the two bars of the broken bar
    glyph) and in three masters, the top bar is denominated as first, while in the
    fourth, the bottom bar is denominated as first. OK, finally found it: Tools/MM/Match
    Master.'

  body: 'By contrast, in Fog, if you have two elements and simply cut and paste one
    of them, it is automatically no. 2 of the two elements. It would be nice to have
    a more explicit way of controlling these things in Fontlab, and of course, we
    need the ability to edit individual masters with more control than we have now.
    Something like a switch that would just turn all the forced conformity off. Tant
    pis, if it results in incompatible masters for some users. Nobody will be using
    it who doesn''t know what he or she is going. '
