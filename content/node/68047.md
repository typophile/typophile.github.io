body: "<a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Brand#Light: Ubuntu is Lightware\">The visual
  side of the Ubuntu brand is getting an upgrade (scroll down a little)</a>. Some
  people like the fresh new look; others immediately homed in on the re-adjusted window
  buttons, which have been moved to the left (and is that an outline around the 'x'?).
  Still others are concerned by the \"purple\" wallpaper and slightly pleased by the
  new monochrome system tray icons.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Artwork/Official\">original
  logo / artwork</a> is still online, for comparison.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  check out that 'x' in the new 'xubuntu'! Yow."
