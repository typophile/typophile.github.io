body: '<B>Hi!</B> <BR>I&#39;ve been following the discussions on this forum for a
  while now - and it has been very inspiring to see the work in progress here.  <BR>I&#39;ve
  been working on this font &#40;working title: A1&#41; for a couple of weeks and
  would like to have some critique. The missing glyphs of the l/c plus all of the
  u/c glyphs still need some &#40;lots of&#41; work, but I would like to hear your
  comments before I move along.  <BR>The font is partly based on the <I>superellipse</I>
  &#40;thanx to <I>Herman Zapf</I> and this discussion board for introducing me to
  the superellipse&#41; and its stems and hairlines has the same width as <I>Helvetica
  Neue 55 Roman</I> - so the uploaded image is an example of A1 roman &#40;regular&#41;.
  Other weights will perhaps follow. <BR> <BR><B>Tor</B> <BR> <BR><!-Attachment: font_a1.swf-!><CENTER><TABLE

  body: '<B>Hello Hrant</B> <BR> <BR>Thank you for the kind words. What exactly do
    you mean by &#34;free&#34;? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m wondering if there isn&#39;t a problem
    with the arm of the l/c &#34;e&#34; - because of being parallel to the baseline
    it seems to &#34;hang&#34; under it - especially if followed by a round shape
    &#40;the bowl in g or q&#41;. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2522.gif"
    ALT="A1.gif"> <BR> <BR>And what about the &#34;a&#34; - it&#39;s the only glyph
    that has a terminal - that is maybe too exotic if its the only terminal in the
    whole face? <BR> <BR>By the way: FF Signa is drawn by danish designer <I>Ole Soendergaard</I>
    and I must admit that I admire that particular face quite a lot. This shouldn&#39;t
    be too obvious though ...  <BR> <BR><B>Tor</B>'

    <BR>I think your &#34;e&#34; is fine - maybe a bit wide. <BR>The &#34;a&#34; has
    a terminal? Is it in white?  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp '
