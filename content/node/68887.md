  body: "Valerie, did you try to post this twice? At least I notice you have two posts
    with identical titles. Would you please use a more unique title, so that each
    post can be recognized in the list of threads? \r\n\r\nIt helps if you tell us
    something about the style, since some of us specialize and would look at those
    styles we are best at identifying. It also helps if you give the sample words,
    or letters, in the title. This helps those who were looking for your question,
    find it again hours or days later.\r\n\r\nFor example you could edit the title
    of this thread to be \"DE VOS techno outline font\" (as the originator, you can
    edit the title of your own thread).\r\n\r\nWelcome to Typophile, by the way. I
    hope you don't mind my Titling lesson.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
