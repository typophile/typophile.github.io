body: "Tangle is a fun font which I drew by hand to have the look of twining vines,
  reminiscent of a grape arbor in the winter.  The inspiration is from my front gate
  which is twined with an endless tangle of mustang grape vines.  It was designed
  on a whim, but turned out pretty well.  It has a full upper and lower case character
  set, plus numbers and punctuation and special characters.  Maybe some clever vintner
  will notice it and put it to use on a wine label.  You can try out the free demo
  version of Tangle for either <a href=\"http://www.ragnarokpress.com/scriptorium/tangledemo.sit\">
  MacOS</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ragnarokpress.com/scriptorium/tangledemo.zip\">
  Windows</a>.  It features just the upper case characters.  The full version of Tangle
  is available on our <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=tangle\">Ordering
  Site</a>.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tanglemf_4093.jpg]"
