  typefaces have an uppercase I that is just a vertical bar. Most (all?) serif typefaces
  have horizontal bars/serifs on the top and bottom of the uppercase I. \r\n\r\nIs
  there a term for the seemingly rarer case when a sans serif typeface has an uppercase
  I WITH bars such as in this example? "

    the letters like i, j, l and 1 as well. There must be some terminology."

  body: I don't think there is a term specifically for this, and perhaps there should
    be. Many all-caps comic fonts have both kinds, so that the serifed I can be used
    for the personal pronoun "I" while the plain I is used in other words; I believe
    Charles Schulz was the first to adhere to this practice consistently in his hand
    lettering.
