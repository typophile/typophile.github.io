  body: I think both of these were caused by untrained installers--something like
    Fritz and Freddie work at the mall as floor sweepers, Sam Smashed, the sign guy
    didn't make it to work because he was, well, smashed. Sam's boss was in a pickle
    so he asked Fritz and Freddie if they wanted to make a few extra Pounds or Euros
    and they said sure! Sam's boss drew a nice straight line on the wall and told
    them "the bottom of the letter sits on the line." Fritz did the German, and by
    god, he followed directions on EVERY letter. Freddie did the English but Freddie
    was actually Sam Smashed's nephew so he got, well, smashed, too. He thought the
    difference between uppercase and lower case was a question of how high the beer
    cases were stacked.  The rest is history ;-)

    a boat.\r\nWent to the Canadian Tire (hardware) store, but they didn't have all
    the letters I need in the size required.\r\nI was tempted to improvise.\r\nSo
    I can imagine Freddy and Fritz wanted to get the job done, but the sign store
    was out of \"a\"s (hey, it's a popular letter) \u2014 no problemo! \u2014 being
    the creative chaps they are, their design solution was to get the available '\"u\"s
    and rotate them, and to disguise this shortcoming, they f*cked up the \"s\" and
    \"e\", and the positioning of the word (non-centred), to complete the drunk punk
    aesthetic."
