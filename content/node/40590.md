body: I saw a Flash animation a few weeks ago of four Rs fighting, but I can't find
  it again. It also highlighted the differences among the Rs. The Rs were Futura,
  Helvetica, Arial and another sans serif. Does anyone know where it is?

    fighting Arial</a>\r\n\r\nI think I know which one you\u2019re talking about;
    I found <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/unbeige/on/ellen_lupton_my_shirts_coming_unbuttoned_26001.asp\">this
    in an article</a> about [[Ellen Lupton]]:\r\n\r\n<cite>a film made by her son
    Jay Miller, called \"Rated R.\" It's \"about how to recognize fonts by the letter
    R.\"\r\nFonts are: Interstate, Helvetica, Arial, and Futura, \"four of the world's
    most fearsome fonts,\" battling to the death.\r\nNow it's just a fight between
    all the letter R's. We can't really explain any more than that, but it's exactly
    what it sounds like. R on R R-hating.</cite>\r\n\r\nAlas, I don\u2019t know if
    this film is online.\r\nF"

  body: I had been looking there, but I couldn't find it because there was no link
    to "Rated R" on [[http://www.papress.com/thinkingwithtype/resources/crimes_scale.htm|this
    page]]--only on the other type crime pages. I've emailed Ellen Lupton about this.
