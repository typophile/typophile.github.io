  books? I will self publish books under CC, that's why they must be free. There are
  some amazing ones that are non-free, especially from Adobe, but I couldn't fine
  anyone that was clean, light and elegant enough to provide a pleasant reading. So
  maybe you know some. ;)\r\n\r\nBy the way [[http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2011/02/30-of-the-best-font-foundries/|this
  website]] contains a description of \"Stone Type Foundry\", the same font in the
  attached image. I was astonished how beautiful and elegant it is, and I think it
  must be perfect to publish a book. Unfortunately it's paid. But what do you think
  of it? Just curious.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stonetype_4910.jpg]"

    everyone would be using it; it would be all over the net. So first step is \"best\"
    for what? Romantic poetry? Historical fiction? Social sciences? Physics? And ink
    on paper or pixels on screen? If on screen, PDF or EPUB?\r\n\r\nMoving on, I know
    current publishers call themselves \"content providers.\" Which is silly, the
    author is the content provider. The publisher's role is, say, that of \"content
    assurer.\" The work of editors and designers (and typesetters) adds a level of
    quality few authors can bring to their content. Think about that.\r\n\r\nI'd assume
    by \"free\" you mean what's generally meant by \"libre.\" \"Libre\" with fonts
    means, usually, that the license permits unlimited use, except for (re)selling
    the fonts. But licenses vary, you need to understand them.\r\n\r\nAll of that
    said, I'm an advocate of libre fonts. And almost all of them need some work to
    be brought up to first-class status. \"Best of the ho-hum\" isn't a particularly
    good place.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nSumner Stone's done fine work over the years.
    A polished professional. What you would expect from the guy who, when at Adobe,
    hired Slimbach & Twonbly & generally built Adobe's font department in earlier
    days...\r\n\r\nHowever, most of his fonts were drawn when ink was put on paper
    in a slightly a different way, and have not been re-weighted for DTP printing.
    Some find that a problem. But web and ink are different...\r\n\r\nYou sure you
    don't want some quality assurance?"

    what are the specific terms? As I understand it CC-licenses have multiple levels.\r\n\r\nBtw:
    When judging a typeface, you need to look at it in context. The letterforms of
    Sator might look beautiful up close and alone, but it tells you nothing about
    how it will preform in your book. And that list, while it contains some interesting
    foundries, is utter bull crap. Never trust those lists. That\u2019s the road to
    perdition."

    use you have to embed it in the PDF file.\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip about the

    released only in PDF.</cite>\r\n\r\nFWIW, I have used a reworked version of Charis-SIL
    in this context. Two books set in Charis, designed by Cherie Westmoreland, were
    selected for the AAUP Book Show. To the best of my knowledge, these are the only
    Libre fonts ever used in an AAUP Book show selection.\r\n\r\nCharis-SIL is esentially
    the same as Bitstream Charter, a font family designed by Matthew Carter (a MacArthur
    grant recipient). It is not, perhaps, generally regarded as an elegant font, but
    is eminently readable.\r\n\r\nModifications we made were basically in spacing,
    and cutting old-style numbers -- not particularly needed for social sciences.\r\n\r\nA
    good companion sans, if you want one, is Lato.\r\n\r\nI can look tomorrow for
    an Amazon \"Look Inside\" to show it's use...\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nIn the meantime:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bing.com/images/search?q=charis+SIL&qpvt=charis+SIL&FORM=IGRE\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bing.com/images/search?q=Lato+fonts&qs=n&form=QBIR&pq=lato+fonts&sc=8-10&sp=-1&sk="

  body: "@Frode Bo Helland:\r\n<cite>Do you allow people to edit and reprint/republish
    the book? Do you provide source files for them?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, the answer
    <em>has</em> to be \"yes\" to those questions if the book itself is under an open-source
    license. So you have to be able to do those things to every part of the book in
    the format (i.e. .doc, .odt, .pdf) in which it will be distributed - and that
    includes the fonts.\r\n\r\nNow, why he would need to make his book open-source
    instead of just free as in beer is unclear. Perhaps it's a nonfiction book to
    which others could usefully add. Or perhaps it includes extensive quotation from
    another book that's under an open-source license, in which case it <em>must</em>
    be open-source. Or perhaps he chose to have that license to support the open-source
    movement."
