  tell me what typeface it is based on.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more of a sample.\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\n"

  body: '[[FutureBrand]] did the UPS rebranding a couple of years ago. Featured on
    their site is the casestudy claiming that " a custom typeface was develloped",
    when in fact, even here on Typophile, a lot of us noticed that it is merely, if
    at all, an adaptation of the ubiquous FF Dax. So I guess it is safe to suggest
    you use this typeface if you can''t get the "UPS Sans" corporate typeface.'

  body: It <em>is</em> reverse-engineered FF Dax. Erik Spiekermann showed us proof
    at TypeCon2005, and I had already come to that same conclusion through my research
    for my presentation about piracy issues in corporate typeface design.
