body: "Apologies if this is the wrong thread, I am happy for it to moved if it is
  in the wrong area.\r\n\r\nBasically, I am embarking on a logo design for a client,
  at this stage I am just sketching some ideas.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have this:\r\n\r\nhttp://lw-d.co.uk/concept.gif\r\n\r\nJust
  a rough sketch, the clients names consists of the letters c and f, I wanted to try
  and tie in the two letters as a symbol, with the logo-type to the right (signified
  by the three lines.\r\n\r\nNow, I know this is a very rough sketch, but I was wondering
  if anyone can recommended any fonts that would get me started with the logotype,
  I am considering illustrating the c and f, but think that an existing font would
  be easier, and, with complexitites of typography.... better formed.\r\n\r\nSo, to
  conclude this lenghty post, can anyone recommend any fonts that would set up a nice
  c and f logotype, the added benefit of using an exsiting font is that I can compliment
  the font with the full company name on the right.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any help.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n "

  body: ok, may be just a base, but try Kievit Italic. A smooth sans serif logo, if
    you wish to scape from the traditional serifed italics (like a sabon next italic
    or bodoni italic, for instance), or the tendency for a script face, like Zapfino.
    Hope it helps. Good luck!

  body: "I think you should try draw this form by hand and make it truly your own.
    There's great potential in your initial sketch. However there's no harm looking
    some other typefaces. I'm a big fan of the work of Argentine typographer [[http://www.myfonts.com/person/paul/alejandro/|Alejandro
    Paul]] of [[http://www.sudtipos.com|Sudtipos]]. He does some excellent calligraphic
    faces from which you could probably take some inspiration. Have a look at [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000181|Affair]]
    or maybe something a bit more tame like [[http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/3|Chocolate]].
