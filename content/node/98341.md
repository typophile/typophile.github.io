  body: "It depends.\r\n\r\nLacking context, I would say the bottom one. If you want
    it to look a bit traditional/old-fashioned, the middle one. If you want the acronym
    to stand out, the top one (with the middle one doing this more than the bottom
    one).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'Yes. The top one looks unbalanced to me. The initial letters in the default
    settings feel too heavy. Curious that this is how H&FJ ship the font. A nod to
    traditional use? The context is: usernames in an application (first name, second
    name).'

  body: Paul, are you sure that you're actually using the small cap characters, accessed
    through the OpenType palette,  in Gotham Narrow? The top example is what I would
    expect to see when the application scales the glyphs in a face that doesn't have
    true small caps included.

  body: "As Hrant says, context is important.\r\nSmall caps are a contrast style,
    so what are you most likeley to be contrasting with?\r\nIf you intend to use it
    primarily for, say, acronyms in running U&lc text, then you should consider the
    options in that context.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative to changing weight is to apply
    a stroke value in InDesign.\r\nIt may also be useful to add a little horizontal
    scaling and extra tracking.\r\n"

  body: As far as I know, neither width of Gotham comes with small caps, so what paultype
    seems to be trying is to emulate the look of true small caps by using scaled full
    caps. I think this does not work at all. In all three cases, the artificial small
    caps look too narrow and I doubt that this can be remedied by stretching them.
    If it is just one or two words at a fairly small size, go for the third option.

  body: thankyou for everyone's expertise. I had assumed that gotham included small
    caps and that the examples above were created as such (not with full caps scaled
    down). Yes I was using otf character panel. Thankyou all for the guidance.

  body: "If a font does not include small caps, scaled-down full caps are what InDesign
    or Illustrator give you without even showing a warning. They expect you to notice
    yourself\u2014and in 9 out of 10 cases you really should. As a Gotham alternative
    with small caps, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson_studio/proxima_nova_complete_ot/\">Proxima
    Nova</a> might be worth a try."

  body: "I would say they are also a bit too small. If they're fake, you can change
    the general scaling used in the \"typography\" (if that's the name) pallet, but
    I usually set up a character style, and give a different percentage to height
    and width. So far, nothing you can do about the weight with InDesign -- smallest
    you can stroke them is .25 points, and that's usually too much.\r\n\r\nYou can
    also get into disagreements (watch the responses here!) about the right size.
    For acronyms, I like small caps to be just a touch larger than the x-height of
    the lower case letters. They should stick out without calling attention to themselves.
    Yeah, that's a long way from giving a cookbook  answer.\r\n\r\nIn your case, you're
    using cap-small cap, and again, I'd set them a little bigger. They don't quite
    balance, to my eye.\r\n\r\nOne problem with using a character style where horizontal-vertical
    scaled is applied: kerning will be broken where the scaled letters fall next to
    an unscaled glyph -- if you set \"RCA's\" and apply scaling to RCA but not the
    following apostrophe, the automatic kerning with the A and the apostrophe will
    be lost. Have to do it by hand, with each occurrence. \r\n\r\nI use this trick
    with true-cut small caps if they're not to my taste as well. You can't go very
    far before you mess up the weight enough to look bad, though. Maybe a 5% to 7%
    change is all that won't show -- depends on the font.\r\n\r\nBTW,  I've used Thomas
    Phinney's Hypatia Sans where others might use Gotham. I know they're a bit different.
    I usually prefer Hypatia Sans. Which, BTW, has small caps. No condensed, though."

  body: "Quite valuable insights, Charles\u2014thanks! Let me add the following:\r\n\r\n<cite>So
    far, nothing you can do about the weight with InDesign -- smallest you can stroke
    them is .25 points, and that's usually too much.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt is possible
    to add strokes of .01 points (and probably less, but I couldn\u2019t see these)
    in CS5, so you actually can beef up light small caps. I do this all the time."

  body: "Ah, thanks. \r\n\r\nWe still use CS4. Tried to go to 5.5, but it had a bug
    that made it not useable with our workflow. Don't ask, it will just get into a
    litany of InDesign bugs. That particular one's gone in CS6, but we've not completely
    wrung 6 out yet. Anyway. something to look forward to. Another example of something
    you can do in either a font editing program or a layout program, unless the silly
    font license requires you to do it in the layout program...as with all H&FJ fonts...\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."
