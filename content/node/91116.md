  usage notes and download available on my <a href=\"http://notes.jos.net.au/current/6px/\">website</a>.
  A brief introduction:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201CThis font was created for a digital
  flyer design in 2008. I was interested in how far common symbols, numbers and letterforms
  could be reduced on screen before becoming illegible (this was before the advent
  of retina displays). The resulting font has a \u2018natural resolution\u2019 of
  six pixels in height, including ascenders and descenders, hence its name.\u201D</blockquote>"
