body: "I am applying for college and I thought that it would be a good idea if I made
  my own website (www.ausste.com)\r\n\r\nI worked on this identity for a week and
  this is what I came up with.\r\n\r\nInfo:\r\nI first drew some ideas in my sketch
  book focusing on one style; simplicity. When people see my identity, I want them
  to come up with an image of \"modern\" and a somewhat image of elegance. So I came
  up with putting my own font into a circle and it looked great. As for the text \"Ausst\xE9
  Design\". I chose the font Britanica. I especially loved the shape of the \"A\"
  and \"g\". I just couldn't get my eye off it.\r\n\r\nSo please tell me what you
  think."

  body: I think Rat and Will have brought up very good points here. I would consider
    revising the "A" in your graphic

  body: "Why do the negative tracking thing with Helvetica? Personally I think it's
    quasi-hip and pretty badly readable. I never understood that trend.\r\n\r\nI mean,
    a little negative tracking is fine, but some of the letters are basically touching
    each other. Especially at smaller sizes."

  body: yup. that A is the opposite of modern. and elegance. The "ausste design" font
    is modern--i.e. sans serif, minimalist, rigid. but elegant usually implies soft
    curves, something ornate.

  body: "Hmm ... when I look at your website, I see even more flaws with your design.
    The problem is your application of Britanica: just because it's not Helvetica
    doesn't mean it doesn't carry the same issues of blandness and lack of originality
    that the poor use of Helvetica carries.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the touching letters isn't
    working for you. Again, it lends a derivative sense to the whole design.\r\n\r\nThe
    'A' is much more interesting, if not in need of tweaking. If you've designed the
    'A' from scratch, why not match it by creating a complementary font for the name?\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick

    this one but in the future (probably a month from now) I will create my own font
    and use it.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for their crit!"

  body: "Those bears are great. There is some fantastic negative space between them,
    almost a reversed S shape.\r\nI like your custom A too, but that is because it
    looks like old signage lettering to me, not something modern and elegant. It has
    a '50s gas station feel to it."
