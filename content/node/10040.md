body: Hello. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not a typographer, but the craft has always interested
  me. Something that I&#39;ve wondered about for a long while is why there seem to
  be two distinct &#40;but identifiable&#41; versions of the lowercase &#34;g&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m unfamiliar with the lexicon for discussing type, so I&#39;ll do
  my best with a visual description. In some fonts, the &#34;g&#34; is composed of
  a bulb, a loop that drops below the baseline, and a slight vertical protrusion at
  the top right corner. In other fonts, the &#34;g&#34; is composed of two bulbs,
  one below the baseline and attached to the other with a short loop, and a horizontal
  or diagonal protrusion at the top right corner. Whether a font has one &#34;g&#34;
  or the other is seemingly totally independent of its style. Two examples of these
  &#34;g&#34;s are in the fonts Futura and Trebuchet MS. <BR> <BR>Why is there this
  duality? And how did the double-bulbed variety come about? I&#39;ve been pondering
  this over with friends; we feel that they both must have developed from one variety
  in the past. We also realized that the same duality occurs with the letter &#34;a&#34;,
  though not necessarily in the same font as the &#34;g&#34;. <BR> <BR>Does anyone
  know how these dualities came about?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/68446.jpg"

  body: These dualities stem from the derivation of type from written forms, and represent
    two historical ways in which these letters developed prior to the invention of
    printing from moveable type. These are not, by the way, the only forms of g and
    a encountered in <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11403a.htm">palaeography</a>,
    there are other forms which did not influence the development of typographic forms,
    or whose influence was short-lived or localised. A good example of localised influence
    is the traditional Irish g. You can see some examples in Michael Everson&#39;s
    digitisations of <a href="http://www.evertype.com/celtscript/csmain.html">historical
    Irish types</a>.

    like to add a little more, if I may

  body: I think the distinction is really about how the bottom part of the g connects
    to the top part, and what we think of as single-storey is a class of form in which
    the bottom part of the letter comes off a right stem.

    <BR> <BR>what do you make of this? is it really harder for young children to &#34;read&#34;
    these letters? or is it just that we teach the simpler forms first?'

  body: 'Nobody has addressed printing problems of the various g&#39;s which have
    had so much influence and about which there must be many who can speak much more
    authoritatively than me. The major reason for the simplified g of Helvetica &#40;and
    the a&#41; is that they are much less likely to clot, not just in metal, but also
    in digital type, at small sizes. &#40;Look at the Meta bold g in Fowler MEU 3
    for a terrifying example of this problem in modern printing and this using a supposedly
    rational font. Why does anybody ever believe anything that a manufacturer or designer
    ever says about a font?&#41; <BR> <BR>One miscellaneous point: many metal fonts
    with beautiful g&#39;s have had short lives and limited usage for the simple reason
    that the character broke too easily.'

    about this with Sue Walker, head of the typography department at the University
    of Reading and an expert on the typography of childrens&#39; books. She says that
    there is no evidence that children cannot easily recognise and accept two forms
    of a/g, even at an early age.

    <BR> <BR>This is generally true, though there are certainly always exceptions.
    Double-story &#34;a&#34; and &#34;g&#34; are also fairly common in sans serif
    Roman fonts as well. But of course, in an effort to simplify the structure, many
    sans serif designers opt for a single-story character. <BR> <BR>&#34;for your
    consideration: does the following glyph look more like the double-storied g? or
    a single-story g?&#34; <BR> <BR>As always, this is one of those cases where one
    could argue it falls under either category. &#40;Sort of like, is the movie a
    drama with comedy, or a comedy with drama.&#41; Within the branch of Gothic characters,
    it was also quite common to find &#34;a&#34;s that appear to be in both categories
    at the same time. <BR> <BR>But if one wanted to be a historic stickler, the&#34;g&#34;
    example you show would more technically come under the heading of a single-story
    character. This is because it is a Textura character following the same principle
    as the Italic &#40;and other manuscript hands of that era&#41; lowercase &#34;g.&#34;
    The lowercase &#34;g&#34; of that time was always closed &#40;i.e., the descender
    hooked back up to the nadir of the body&#41;. This was done to prevent it from
    being confused with a &#34;q,&#34; which back then was written like we make today&#39;s
    &#34;hooked-g.&#34; This enclosed Italic &#34;hooked-g&#34; was a single-story
    &#34;g&#34; &#40;even though it appears to fall into either category&#41; because
    within the same Italic alphabet there was also a version &#40;sometimes multiple
    versions&#41; of &#34;linked-g&#34; &#40;double-story g&#41; as well. Both &#34;g&#34;s
    were freely used side by side. '

    looking at the scripts that predated printing types you can see where either of
    our modern forms of the letter could be derived from the same script form. <BR>
    <BR><i>But of course, in an effort to simplify the structure, many sans serif
    designers opt for a single-story character.</i> <BR> <BR>what i think is really
    interesting is that the sanserif italic has particular freedom in adapting any
    of the letter styles for it&#39;s particular needs. The first time I saw it, I
    was fascinated by Bringhursts table of the Italicization Quotient of Thirteen
    Unserifed &#39;Italics&#39; in <i>Elements</i>.
