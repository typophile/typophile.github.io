  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Im doing a project for my graphic design class. The goal is to create 3 unique brochures sharing a common thread. individually these brochures are about a single typeface the common thread is the classification, Slab Serifs. My selections are, Rockwell, Chaparral, and Lubalin Graph. I know that these arn’t the best and that serifa and stymie would be better choices but i’m a student, and well that’s all i can get my hands on. okay, so my question to you fellow type lovers is, does anyone know WHO created rockwell? I Keep Finding that Rockwell was created by Monotype Designs, But my instructor wants to know WHO created it. i assume it was a collective effort. the reason why its also important from a design perspective is because i need an image of the creator, and if the creator was a company instead of a single human being or a team, im going to need to find an image of a building and photoshop Monotype designs on the side of it. Not my style.</p>
<p>Oh and another question, does anyone know where i can find the three typefaces, Rockwell, Chaparral, and Lubalin Graph in use? I know that WHATTHEFONT.COM is useful at figuring out what font is used the only trouble is i have to HAVE the fonts in my cache, and i cant seem to find anything.</p>
<p>Id appreciate all the help i can get and i look forward to learning from you all.</p>

Lawson has a chapter on square serifs in Anatomy of a Typeface. It&rsquo;s online <a href=" http://books.google.com/books?id=FiJ87ixLs0sC&pg=PA320&lpg=PA320&dq=Litho+Antique+font+history&source=web&ots=iHi7dcNt9m&sig=DiWkltZxAHZH2etk_IUAIImvf3w&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=5&ct=result#PPA6,M1">here.</a></p>
<p>Bringhurst uses Chaparral very well in &ldquo;The Solid Form of Language&rdquo;, and Bicycling magazine uses it almost exclusively. I can&rsquo;t recall seeing the other two recently, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;serifa and stymie would be better choices &ldquo;&hellip; Why? These three are fine, and, to my mind, Chaparral is very good.</p>

<p>The information in Adobe&rsquo;s Read Me echoes what McGrew wrote about a face called Rockwell Antique. But McGrew goes on to note &ldquo;English Monotype has several weights of Rockwell, a square serif family which differs from this face and should not be confused with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rockwell that most of us are familiar with is not quite the same as the Rockwell that originated as Inland Type Foundry&rsquo;s Litho Antique. But I suppose that the Salfords Works could have based their drawings on the American original, making changes as they saw fit.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John &ndash; Looking at this again, I think the relationship is greater than McGrew&rsquo;s statement might lead one to believe. It would probably be possible to trace a link from the English Monotype Rockwell (which gives us our current digital form) back to the original Inland Litho Antique.</p>
<p>In which case, for what it&rsquo;s worth to the original poster, Litho Antique is attributed to William Schraubstädter for Inland Type Foundry.</p>
