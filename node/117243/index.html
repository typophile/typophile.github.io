		<div class="commentbody"><p>Clevercrows, could you give a little info on how and where this will be used? And is this on a flat or rounded surface?</p>
<p>To my eyes, the lettering seems to be too much. You&rsquo;ve got the fancy letters, the fill in the letters, the shadow which maybe has its own fill, and the varying of the shadow for the 3-dimensional look. To me, it just seems distracting. I would like to see this without the shadow at all. The fill of the letters looks nice (very equine) but it does give a light horizontal streak through the letters about mid-height. Is this intended? The horse&rsquo;s head seems like an after thought. It looks kind of bolted on rather than an integral part. But it might be okay, depending on the use. Those are my thoughts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Agree with J. Tillman&rsquo;s comments. We really need to know more about the company before we can judge the logo properly, but the 3D effect is distracting, especially since it makes the letters look liked they are wrapped around some invisible object. And the horse head symbol is too small. I would either make the head larger to be the dominant element, perhaps with the type below it, or else draw some lines so the type and symbol are all enclosed within a common shape (think of how the old MGM logo handled the lion head).</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a start; keep working on it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you J. Tillman and JamesM for your response to my post and to the great advice!</p>
<p>This is the very first logo I have ever tried to create. It sure is fun trying!</p>
<p>This is a horse trail ride, riding lesson, and horse rescue barn (soon to be 501c3 non profit). This is where I go for unguided horseback riding. The girl that runs this rescue mentioned that they were looking for a new fresh logo, so I am just messing around to see if I can come up with anything. Like I said, I have no idea what I am doing.</p>
<p>I used Corel WordPerfect&rsquo;s Textart (which uses a textbox) and this was my first try. After I saved it, I immediately went back to change the part I didn&rsquo;t care for at all, which is all of that gold shadow/fill, which is way too much! I wasn&rsquo;t too sure about the arch/bend to the lettering, but I wanted to first see what the result would be once I cleaned it up.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that once I open up the Textart textbox, it changes completely (the font, color, fill). The only thing that stays is the spelling of the two words. I have tried everything, but I cannot edit it at all! So I put it aside and gave the project some thought.</p>
<p>First, I did a google image search to see what styles of horse/equine logos that exist. I noticed that the majority seem to be of some type of black and white outline of a horse head or an outline of a horse running. I wanted something a little different and unique. I noticed that in a lot of the logos I found, the name seems to get lost and does not stand out at first glance. I thought it makes more sense to have the name as the primary focus and have the image a secondary enhancement. Then I realized that the letter placement of the two words was going to be a bit of a challenge with my lack of experience (as far as selecting a font).</p>
<p>A lot of fonts look nice until you put a &ldquo;capital E&rdquo; next to a &ldquo;qu&rdquo;, then it suddenly looks strange. A lot of fonts have funky looking &ldquo;q&quot;s and capital &ldquo;E&quot;s, in my opinion. I personally love the font in the logo, just not all of the extra. You are right, way too much going on. If only I could edit it! There wasn&rsquo;t much choice as far as the color and pattern of the lettering, but I thought it was okay, and I think that the horse picture in a weird matches as far as the color scheme.</p>
<p>THEN, I watched a couple of videos on general guidelines and advice on logos and types of fonts, etc&hellip;.and realized that I had it all wrong! The video suggested to never use any type of 3D text or coloring, because you need to consider the different possibilities that people could do with it. If someone happened to print it, it could very likely print out all messed up and unreadable. Especially if they did not print it in color. It pointed out to always use a font type that is very readable and printable in black and white and in greyscale. Makes a lot of sense! I did it all completely opposite.</p>
<p>I have a few other ideas, but for some reason I keep going back to my original first rough draft. I like it for some reason. I like it because to me it is not perfect by all means, but it stands out, is unique and original, and it is different than all of the other equine type of logos that I have seen. I know it is very homemade looking, but I kind of think its flaws are what gives it character.</p>
<p>I know all that sounds pretty strange. I thought I would post it and get your opinions and go from there. At least I am having a fun trying. I am not the type of person that is creative at anything.</p>
<p>Thanks again, I will keep on trying!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi. The cluttered lettering has an interesting texture that goes well with the horse head, and I can see why you like it - it has the crafty hands-on look of worked leather.  Legibility will become a problem in some situations - for example if it is printed really small on a  letterhead, or on a sign seen from the distance.  Make a black and white version without color and if textures create a messy washed-out effect erase some portions, for example the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; of the lettering&quot; or else make some parts solid black.   Then colorize that in two or three colors to see how things look. Use layers to add background color or outline.  In any case the horse should be much larger compared to the lettering. If you can make the lettering on a semicircular line, the lower part of a circle, the horse can be at the center. Try that. If you put lettering and horse within an outline shape, say a semicircle, everything will look nice and compact. Good luck and have fun!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Clevercrows, it sounds like you are on the right track. Stay with your ideas. I also like (what I think was) your original idea.</p>
<p>Ask your customer in what format she needs the logo. For print, it might be two forms: a color graphic such as a PNG file at 300 dots per inch and a black and white graphic at 3oo dots per inch. Or it might be part of Corel or Microsoft Word template for writing letters. For internet use it might be a JPG file at a lesser dots per inch. Maybe Corel permits saving a file as, or exporting as, a graphic format.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a free graphics program, I would recommend Paint.net. There is a learning curve, but it&rsquo;s do-able.

<p>In general that&rsquo;s good advice. There are occasions when 3D makes sense, but since this is your first logo I&rsquo;d keep it simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>or coloring</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an area that&rsquo;s changing. In the past most everything got printed at a print shop, so more colors meant more expense, and a color logo would look bad in a Xerox or fax. These days many companies do most of their promotional work over the web or in emails, where color is free, and most companies email instead of sending faxes. But Xeroxing might still a factor if your client prepares promotional materials that.</p>
<p>You definitely want a good black-and-white version of the logo to use when needed, but if your client is using the web then color may not be as big an issue these days.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of the &ldquo;Word Art&rdquo; function in MS Word and similar applications; the results invariably look like something one might have used for the title banner of a personal homepage 20 years ago when the internet was still young. In particular, when the results are pixely, hard to read, bent and distorted, it does more harm than good.</p>
<p>The font and the horsehead illustration don&rsquo;t strike me as particularly good choices either. The font feels old-fashioned to me (I mistook it for Zapf Chancery at first sight), and it suffers from the horizontal compression. You wouldn&rsquo;t squash a photograph to half its width, would you? The same thing happens with letters. If you absolutely need it that narrow, use a narrow font. As for the horse, I&rsquo;m getting a meek and hapless vibe from it. The cut also reminds me of a wall-mounted trophy a bit.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be disheartened, though; nobody gets it right in the first try. Keep working on it! I suggest trying out a slab serif, and maybe experimenting with a more symbolic graphic.</p>
