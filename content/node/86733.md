body: "The project is a book about a Nepalese hospital. The intended audience is English
  speaking, 30-40-somethings, tourists or not. I've looked for types that might fit
  this sort of a project. I want to echo Devanagari and signpainting in the Latin
  letterforms somehow, but it's important for me to avoide the stereotypes. The books
  is based around a few short texts accompanied by images, spanning about 100 pages.
  I'm looking for a text face and a suitable companion for titles.\r\n\r\nMy shortlist
  so far:\r\n\r\nShabash\r\nThis might be too stereotypical, although I'm sure my
  client would buy into it. I've kept it on my list because it's such a quality design,
  and for reference.\r\n\r\nLisboa Swash\r\nNot sure if it's available, but the latin
  influcence is fluid enough to fit and some of the alts, like f.x. the y seems very
  fitting as sprinkle.\r\n\r\nQuadraat\r\nThe \"errors\" is what draws me to Quadraat
  in this case: the dropping R and the top heavy g reminds me of sign lettering. Other
  features, like B/R, a &c mimicks rotation and pressure changes in a brush. Quadraat
  also has the qualities to fill both roles, being both decorative and calm.\r\n\r\nNovel\r\nThe
  rotation of the tool is also what draws me to Novel. This might be to understated
  for display, but obivously not for extended body copy.\r\n\r\nMeran\r\nThe abrubpt
  shapes, its angularity and the diagonal cuts echoes the Devangari script, as well
  as the implied reverse angle of the pen in descenders on g/y.\r\n\r\nLydian\r\nSimilar
  to Meran in many ways, but feels more dated. I like the \"clumpsyness\". Somehow
  it feels like it was drawn really large. I like that it's not so subtle. The cursive
  is a plus here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI've also looked at ITF's Kohinoor, but the roman
  is too polished, too western. Devanagari is traditionally written with what we consider
  a reverse angle of the pen, so I've been looking into left handed type designers
  like Jim Rimmer, but I haven't found anything I like yet.\r\n\r\nSo, do you have
  any suggestions?\r\n\r\n"

    to suggest Devanagari, but that's probably over-the-top calligraphic.

    quite fascinating."

    Very interesting, but probably too outspoken for text purposes in my book."
