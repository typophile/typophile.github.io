body: "Lokal is a slab serif family with three weights, with italics and small caps,
  made for L\xE4hivakuutus (that's Local Insurance, a Finnish insurance company).
  Before the make-over they used Gill Sans, and they wanted a more friendly typeface
  to get their \"local point\" across. Heh.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I don't have a frame of reference to judge whether this looks more Finnish,
    but compared to Gill Sans, this definitely looks less English, so I'd say it's
    a success on that count.

  body: "Solid yet friendly looking, and the slab serif gives a slightly more serious
    impression than the overall appearance of the company as I know it so far, which
    is a good thing from how I see it. \r\n\r\nLis\xE4\xE4! :)"
