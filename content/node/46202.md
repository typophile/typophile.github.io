  understand the ideas and emotions that type can convey, and use it to create a balance
  piece that conveys a message on every level. \r\n\r\nWhat I am asking for help with
  is this, are there principles or guideline that can be applied to type in order
  to convey meaning, for example what makes the use of one particular font convey
  the meaning of strenght while another is weak? What do you as the typography community
  look for within the type to convey emotion?\r\n\r\nBelieve me, I understand the
  broad nature of my questions but I need a starting point, so that I can make my
  choices based on something other than \"oooh, this looks good\"\r\n\r\n-J."

  body: "certain typefaces can be described in ways that relate to ideas that we apply
    to other things.\r\n\r\nScript:  intimate, time-consuming, effort, hand-rendered\r\n\r\nSturdy
    type: solid, immovable, strong\r\n\r\nThins: excess, luxury, beauty\r\n\r\n\r\nSo
    with kinetic typography I imagine the movements the type takes could be related
    to different paradigms of movement we see in other things:\r\n\r\n-books falling,
    dancing, sliding, rolling.\r\n\r\nI seriously doubt you're going to invent much
    new, it's just the art of taking combinations of letters that mean things and
    building phrases that convey a certain thought progression towards a climax and
    maximum understanding.\r\n\r\nThen taking the words and using the typefaces that
    reinforce and add to those words and set the text in that.\r\n\r\nThen finally
    taking gestures and movements that we all recognize and setting the type to life
    in a way that helps express the thoughts even more\u2026"

    to think about. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I guess what I am taking away from the post
    is, that I need to follow a personal intuition regrading the emotions certain
    type convey, which will hopefully get my understanding of the moment across. \r\n\r\n-J."

    order to make some progress in most things, you need to take something apart and
