  the C gave it away and it just doesn't look quite right - the weight and slant is
  a little off.  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FBO1_6383.gif]"

  body: "Is this a logo? It might a different cut of Furura than you tried (there\u2019s
    so many).\r\nThe C looks custom made (from an O), as does the L, of course."

  body: Yes, the 'C' leads to designs like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/nobel/?sample_text=PLANTRONICS&sample_size=36">Nobel</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/bitstream/drescher_grotesk_bold_ot/?sample_text=PLANTRONICS&sample_size=36">Drescher
    Grotesk</a>.

  body: Yes, it is a logo.  Hard to know which cut it is.  I'm just sticking to what
    I get from the PDFs and modifying Futura where neccesary.  Nobel and Drescher
    Grotesk looks close, DG more so, but neither has an online preview of the Italic.
