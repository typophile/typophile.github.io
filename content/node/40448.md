  have done quite a bit of searching, and all I can work out is that most newspapers
  are printed offset at 100 lpi. Some articles I've read equate this to 150-300 dpi
  and others to 600 dpi or more.\r\n\r\nI suppose a better question would be: to simulate
  newspaper resolution what dpi should I set my laser printer to?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nRyan"

  body: newspapers are quite varied these days in terms of paper stock and print quality.
    Less important than the resolution is the paper stock. Most newsprint (traditionally,
    at least) tends to be rather absorbent and hence, you end up with a bit of ink
    bleed that you want to take into consideration. A laser printer won't necessarily
    emulate that for you. You could go with an inkjet and some crappy paper and trial
    and error.

    a combined CMYK percentages,for instance 80%C, 70%M, 70%Y, 70%K=290%total ink,
    a little high for a magazine, but would still work), while newsprint is 240%.
    You have to setup a special CMYK in Photoshop color settings custom cmyk 240%
    ink total. You can have the LPI set correctly, but if there is too much ink going
    on the paper M U D. I think on a laser printer it would look light, but the end
    result would look good.\r\n\r\nDo you have a photo that has been printed on newsprint?
    I would then try to match the laser printer tor the printed piece.\r\n\r\nThe
    Truth shall set you free"

  body: "The lpi number usually refers to the halftone screen pitch used for photos
    and graphic tones. It has to be fine enough to blend visually while coarse enough
    to produce a sufficiently broad range of dot sizes (and thereby, gamut of tones)
    given the resolution of the imagesetter, compensated for the gain properties of
    the paper, ink, and press. Most such imagesetters run at 1200 dpi or higher. \r\n\r\n100
    lpi tone sounds a bit high for newspaper, but a well maintained offset press with
    the more modern smoother newsprint might be able to handle it.\r\n\r\nOn a laser
    printer you usually have to use an even coarser halftone screen (60-80 lpi) due
    to the cohesive properties of the electrostatic toner. You may only be able to
    produce tones from 20 to 80 % before they blow out to white or gain to solid black,
    respectively.\r\n\r\nStill, test it at various settings. Make a test image with
    stepped tone and smooth gradient bars and see what comes out best at different
    pitches."

  body: "An additional issue in newspaper output is that the editorial staffs usually
    inhabit expensive downtown office space and the production and manufacturing plants
    are on cheaper ground far outside of town, sometimes across the country. This
    means the final pages are often scanned at 600 dpi and sent by secure network
    to the plant. If one reads the NY Times, one can find instant undesired multiple
    masters where the buffer fills up in this process squeezing and then stretching
    a thin column of the whole page.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Newspaper printing is grey ink on grey paper, whereas laser toner is very
    black.\r\nYou can laser print onto newsprint paper, which helps, as does the \"spread\"
    of laser printing, which is a bit like the large amount of press gain in newspaper
    printing.\r\n\r\nIf you're serious about this, I would suggest finding a newspaper
    which uses a commercially available font (Utopia is quite popular), and experimenting,
    trying to create as close a facsimile as possible of a particular page or column.\r\n\r\ndpi
    and lpi have nothing to do with this--they are really only relevant for halftones,
    not type.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Newspapers I'm familiar with print with a line screen of 85 lpi to 105 lpi
    for halftones, which requires a digital image from 170 to 210 ppi. I find my 600
    dpi LaserWriter generates both text and halftones that are a reasonable facsimile
    for a printed newspaper, though looking a little crisper because my paper is whiter
    than newsprint.

    Does anyone know how or if this can be done? I thought I set the line screen back
    in version 5 or 6, but it was so long ago that I can't remember. Thanks!

  body: "Electronic Pre-Press 101:\r\n\r\n<code>Dots per inch (DPI) x2 = Linescreen
    (LPI)</code>\r\n\r\nand (basically)\r\n\r\n<code>DPI = Pixels per inch (PPI) </code>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy
    are most scanned images recommended to be 300 PPI? Because the final output for
    a magazine is typically 150 LPI, give or take. 100 LPI would be really heavy for
    newsprint, since the dot gain would basically wipe out any of the benefit of having
    the higher res. Unless, as was mentioned, really nice newsprint paper were being
    used.\r\n\r\nBut linescreen is not something that we as the designer needs to
    worry about, except for getting the proper resolution of bitmap images. "

  body: "That should be DPI = LPI x 2, as in your example: scan at 300 dpi for printing
    at 150 lpi.\r\n\r\nThe linescreen is useful to know for other design stuff too
    - like how much you enlarge/crop in scanning, for example, may depend on how sharp
    an image you expect your printers to produce. But the general point is very true,
    that the linescreen is something done by the person operating the imagesetter
    or platesetter, not the designer."
