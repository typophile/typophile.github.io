body: "Hello to all, \r\n\r\nI am an honors student, I am doing a project for the
  ISTD, the ultimate goal is to be admitted membership. I am looking for a typeface
  to do my typography design with that relates to my concept \"there is no nothing,
  nothing is everything.\" So a typeface that conveys just that, or means nothing
  or somehow relates to nothing or even everything would be great, even if its name
  contains the word nothing in what ever language although it has to be a good typeface.
  If you could help it will be greatly appreciated."

    people say that [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Helvetica/fonts/|Helvetica]] is
    a very neutral typeface.  "

    sans serif font in a very thin weight that appears to be alsmost nothing.
