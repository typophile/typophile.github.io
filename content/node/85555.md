  body: I need the name of the font, though. I know what the logo looks like. I don't
    need to download it.

  body: riccard0 was saying that IF you need the name of the font, it would be a good
    idea to provide us with a DOWNLOAD of the logo so that we could identify the font
    for you. <strong><em>Your</em></strong> knowing what the logo looks like doesn't
    help us. Or, at least, it doesn't help those of us without ESP...

  body: It's plainly custom-drawn. If you want to imitate it you'll have to work,
    or find someone who can.
