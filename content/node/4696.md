    <BR> <BR>Where&#39;s the problem? Just tell them what it is, plain  <BR>and simple.
    They&#39;re not going to die from shock or  <BR>anything! Those are cartoon bunnies!

  body: David, that was pretty good! <BR> <BR>You know what&#39;s frustrating? I used
    to know this killer joke about a worm that refused to come out of some guy&#39;s
    arse, and something about using chocolate&#42; wrapped in pita bread to coax it
    out, but I forgot it, and for the past 10 years have been trying without success
    to remember it... It&#39;s like a worm in my brain. <BR> <BR>&#42; Another Belgian
