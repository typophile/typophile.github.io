  annual conference \"Tage der Typografie\" are being held for the 12th time this
  year from the 5th to 7th November in D\xFCsseldorf, Germany. The organiser Peter
  Reichard invited Veronika this year to give a weekend workshop as part of the events.\r\nThis
  workshop is aimed to graphic design professionals and students. It may be also of
  interest to calligraphers, editorial designers, information designers and industrial
  designers. By means of tracing pre-selected letters, participants will experiment
  with structural elements of lettershapes such as contrast, connections, weight of
  strokes and curve velocity. They will also learn the basics behind sketching an
  alphabet. This will be aided by short lessons that will establish essential knowledge
  units that support the theoretical framework and the concepts behind the exercises.
  The resulting characters will be openly discussed and corrections and alternatives
  will be shared among participants. During the second day, students will digitize
  their work according to a specific set of instructions and will have the opportunity
  to touch on more advanced questions, such as diacritics, coding, font family development
  and font production."
