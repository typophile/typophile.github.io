    Just a thought.

  body: "> Be sure to paste the full path\r\n\r\nSpeaking of that, do you think there's
    a quick way to automatically add an \"http://\" if it's missing from the links
    in user's profiles? A lot of folks have Home Pages that go nowhere because they
    don't realize they need this bit."

  body: "I think I'm one of the very few type designers on MySpace. \r\n\r\nAnd I've
    managed to sell some fonts thru MySpace, I've actually landed clients there. And
    hell, I'd say it's the best place to find new, obscure musicians. I now have musicians
    as clients too.\r\n\r\nSo: yeah, MySpace please. I have more fun there than Facebook.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nJust
    have an option to put in an 'other' social networking thing, where we input wherever
    we are. There's SOO many right now, I'm not even sure which ones I have accounts
    at anymore."
