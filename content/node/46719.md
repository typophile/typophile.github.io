  body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nI'm truly worried... It seems like this font identification
    thing might look easy, but I know for sure that it is not, I'm writing this 'cause
    nobody has replied to my post, perhaps this font is a custom job? I'm positive
    that this is not the case, maybe I have to wait a little longer 'till the right
    person recognize it and help me with some useful information...\r\n\r\nI'll be
    here forever if I have to... he he he!!\r\n\r\nThanks to all...\r\n\r\nQ\u2122

  body: In some ways it looks as if someone added a stroke to a font to make it faux-bold.
    I wish I could help more than that.

    the contour that surrounds the original typeface, I'm inserting a closeup so you
    can see it...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cin_3670.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm

  body: "So far the only italic I found with an 'n' like this is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/edwardian/|Edwardian]],
    but if you look at the other letters many of them do not match. I think Disney
    has used certain typefaces as starting points, but customizes them to suit their
    readability needs. Perhaps all they did was borrow the idea of the Edwardian n
    (although the C matches pretty well too).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
