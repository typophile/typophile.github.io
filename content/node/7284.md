  at the moment, requires to design a set of stamps that appeal to the younger group,
  it can be worldwide or national, can be aimed at the specific event. <BR> <BR> im
  designing the four seasons for my stamps&#40;i know its quite normal&#41;, i asked
  some ppl b4 about their visions of what the four seasons r like, but when i talked
  to my tutor a few days ago, he said i need the specific reason for why i design
  the stamps for seasons. <BR> <BR> so now my question is: if there are stamps with
  the four seasons on them, what sort of the images of the four seasons would make
  you wanna buy them? or what sort of stamps do u wanna by in spring/summer/autumn/winter?
  <BR> <BR> help help <BR> <BR> thx'
