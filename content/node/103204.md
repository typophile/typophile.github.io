  body: Nice find, Jodie. I'd certainly go with Keystrokes' build quality over Elfring's
    - and the 'A' will need modification with either font.

  body: "That was a film font called Hairstreak (British) and Mossman (American).
    The closest digital version I know of is what Elfring called Mossman and sold
    as shareware years ago. Later, they sold it as Mossy.\r\n\r\nCanada Type offers
    a wonderful version called <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/sympathique/'
    target='_blank'>Sympathique</a>, but it doesn't include the 'G' or 'R' you need
    and is lighter."

  body: "Minimal has a very stylish uppercase but I am disappointed with the lowercase,
    which is a duplicate with some alternates. What suggestions might there be for
    a lowercase of similar weight that would work with Minimal's uppercase? CT's  Sympathique
    lower case is well executed but too curly for my taste.\r\nDon"
