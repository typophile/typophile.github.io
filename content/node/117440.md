body: "Dear Typophile community \r\nA little introduction . I own avery  small publishing
  house, and we have our [digital]  printing machines, until now i was able to solve
  by myself all my little typo problem but this one is out of my league.\r\nLong story
  short, recently an important  customer comes with a problem, he's in charge of the
  publishing department  of an important but very small university, unfortunately
  the printer with whom they have worked for many years for the university publication
  is gone out of the business - a very common story today. Now he asked me if i could
  take the job - of course - but he wants to keep the fonts used until now in the
  publications;  so is very important for me to find the exactly font used in the
  publication.\r\nI managed to get some .pdf made by the original printer for the
  university, but notingh more. here is the link for the file, maybe is more helpful
  than the image :  https://www.dropbox.com/s/juzx57r7al6q6cq/fontxtypophilie.pdf
  \r\nI have checked the font inside the file but they don't have a standard name.
  Could be  a font from the Garamond family ??? but which one ? A simoncini Garamond
  [naaa] an Italian Garamond or  an American ??? \r\nAny help is appreciated, thank
  you very much."

  body: Is kinda different from the Simoncini i use, but watching the Elsner and Flake
    version i think you could be right.
