  an expert) doing a favor for a friend in redesigning their very bland name-style,
  which at the moment is simply the word iLAB set in Helvetica Neue. They like the
  no-nonsense/simplicity/straightforwardness of HN, and i don't think they'll move
  far from this baseline. I was hoping to suggest something to them with a little
  more style to it - they are after all (lighting) designers. Any suggestions would
  be most welcome, thanks."

  body: I love Akkurat. It has a sort of lo-fi "hipster" quality about it. Its use
    on wolffolins.com is a perfect example of that quality.

  body: Thanks everyone. I must say I love trawling through this site when I have
    time and attempting to increase my limited typographic knowledge. The threads
    are almost always helpful, entertaining and interesting. Well done.

  body: "Sort of parallel to what Steve said: the ideal logo is not just a typeset
    font. You could just as well start with Helvomita Olde as long as you then take
    the canned result and craft it towards what the \"iLab\" string wants and most
    of all what the client needs (which is not the same as what the client says it
    wants).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
