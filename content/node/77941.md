  esq with the alternate characters. Thanks

  body: It might be customised Avant Garde, with the serifs & swash-like extensions
    added. There's a similar feel to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cortez/|Cortez]]
    & [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-serif-gothic/|Serif Gothic]].

  body: Agree with you about Lubalin... Looks like a custom based on [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_avant_garde_gothic_pro_virtual/|Avant-Garde
    Gothic Bold]] with stylistic alternates or on [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/itc_lubalin_graph/|Lubalin
    Graph Bold]] which have been designed by Herb Lubalin.

  body: I hadn't thought about Graph. It would be a lot easier to get those serifs
    by cutting across Graph's slabs than to add them to Avant Garde.

    designed the logo, record jacket, and posters for musician Paul Simon\u2019s album
    and movie, <cite>One Trick Pony</cite>, which came out in 1980. I used the typeface
    Avant Garde Latin with pointy serifs, which had never been released to the public,
    and broke up the word \u201COne-Trick\u201D with a hyphen. It\u2019s strong, in
    your face, and the right look.</blockquote>"
