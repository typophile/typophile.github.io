body: Any ideas on this. My first guess was a modified version of <a href = "http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/carbon/bold/">Carbon</a>
  from T-26, but the X is straight and the inside of the O is rounded. Any other fonts
  similar to that?

  body: I was going to say a <em>very</em> interesting take on this style is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=E.105685.0.5&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=MiN+EXO&sampleSize=96">Cholla
    </a> by [[Sibylle Hagmann]], but I think it actually might <em>be</em> Cholla.
    What do you think?

    it's Cholla with a custom R.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: Sorry, the R was on another product package. The O, X, and N seemed to be
    what set it apart so I only included those 2 packages. Here is a shot with the
    P and R[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pro_3688.jpg]

  body: Looks like the R is really easy to customise indeed.
