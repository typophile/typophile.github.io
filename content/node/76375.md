body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nThis week, someone asked me to design a science book,
  which is all set in LaTeX. I don't have any prior experience with this markup language
  and I might lack time to learn it comprehensively. \r\n\r\nHaving gathered some
  information about the language and downloaded the software at http://www.latex-project.org
  I'd say that, with respect to typesetting of scientific formulas, LaTeX can be very
  helpful. But when it comes to over-all book design and typographic details, I'd
  rather stick to InDesign (CS3, it is).\r\n\r\nIs there an easy and reliable way
  to 'translate' LaTeX-documents into InDesign? "

  body: "In short: No.\r\n\r\nI've had mixed results with first converting LaTeX to
    RTF, then importing the RTF into ID, but it <em>totally</em> depends on how \"good\"
    the LaTeX writer was. The more complicated the document is and the more 'tricks'
    the writer used, the smaller is the chance <a href=\"http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/\">Latex2rtf</a>
    can do something -- or anything.\r\nThe RTF files it generates should be checked
    anyway, because at times it seems it forgets the odd closing brace."

  body: "Copy/pasting of formatted TeX code isn't really the best way ... you'd have
    to manually clean up all codes -- that's what LaTex2RTF might be able to do for
    you. TeX' syntax can be used in exceedingly weird ways; it needs a program to
    make sense of it. Search and Replace is not gonna cut it ... (Personal experience:
    Been there, Done that, Given up, Went to do Something else.)\r\n\r\nSecond best,
    however, <em>may</em> be to get hold of a PDF. It might be possible to use Acrobat
    Pro to \"Save As\" the PDF to Word text. It's also fairly unpredictable, because
    it depends on what software produced the PDF in the first place. As with all things
    related to TeX, there are \"proper\" and \"good ol' quick 'n dirty\" ways to do
    so."

  body: Theunis -- a "word space" isn't a character in TeX, and I'd assume not LaTeX
    either. Acrobat's pretty smart, but that does make recovering text set in TeX
    a fair bit more work.

  body: "Well, yes and no.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I don't know LaTex. We used our own implementation
    of TeX for 20 years, which, like LaTeX, was based on plain TeX. Anytime you add
    macros to plain TeX, as LaTeX does, you up the work for someone who doesn't use
    your particular implementation. So I don't really know LaTeX.\r\n\r\nWith that
    caveat, TeX sets better text type than InDesign. Just one example: InDesign's
    line-breaking algorithm is not quite as good as what TeX uses, but takes up less
    memory. That was the basis for the patent Adobe got. TeX isn't WYSIAYG. The control
    is unbelieveable, but so too can be the amount of work needed to exercise that
    control.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, TeX is less good with embellishments. I'd
    hate to use it to set a popular magazine or advertisements -- or for that matter,
    a high school text book as such have developed in the States -- all pictures,
    tints, sidebars, etc. If that's the kind of book it is, you'd be right to move
    it to InDesign.\r\n\r\nBut if it isn't, if it's a science book along the lines
    of a monograph, what you might consider is doing the design with whatever system
    you're comfortable with, then have it set by a compositor who uses LaTeX.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tug.org/texshowcase/"
