  \ I want to find a typeface which will have something of a nomadic feel to it.  I
  would prefer to stay away from papyrus as it seems to be overused.  any suggestions
  would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

  body: "My feeling of what kind of nomads would be cosmic nomads, nomads in the general
    sense.   our website is [[http://www.gemsbynomads.com]] to give you an idea of
    what we are working with. \r\n\r\ni am trying to figure out a typeface to put
    on the labels for the stones in their boxes.  for example \"Neon Blue Tourmaline\"
    would be printed on a small label and put into the box just below the stone(the
    box has a window on the top that the stone and label are visible on).  So the
    Font size is small but needs to be readable from arms length or perhaps a tad
    further.  \r\n\r\nand also just trying to get a feeling for different looks of
    different fonts. as one of the hoi polloi, without any real knowledge of this
    kind of art.  I really appreciate any kind of feedback! thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n"
