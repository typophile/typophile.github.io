body: I have this fascination with the Buddhist and Hindu tradition of mandalas. The
  are traditionally made from sand and I believe that once one is complete it is supposed
  to be swept away, I'm not totally sure about that one. I go a little bit outside
  that tradition. I put them everywhere; in my sketchbook, note pads, text books.
  So I decided to make one that incorporated type, and I love it! All there letters
  are in the middle and the outside is consists of little do dads I made up. I hope
  you enjoy looking as much as I have enjoyed creating.[[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN1904_5214.jpg]
