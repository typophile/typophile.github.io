  restaurant will have  a graffiti wall, so there's an 'urban' element to it (I hate
  that word!)\r\n\r\nI could use some advice on:\r\n1. A font that could serve as
  a logo/wordmark\r\n2. Some supporting faces for menus and such. \r\n\r\nI'm trying
  to steer clear of anything too cliche (and offensive).\r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated."

    down-home southern vs urbanly hip. And of course, a takeout should be friendly
    and maybe a little loud, or at least noticeable. And maybe there should be a nod
    to the graffiti. But nothing that might be offensive or a clich\xE9. That's a
    lot for a font.\r\n\r\nIf \"Soul Food\" is part of the name of the restaurant,
    then everyone probably understands the menu. How about Winco? It's solid and reliable
    (like soul food) and somewhat friendly (not corporate) and a little bit hip and
    has a clean (healthful) look?\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/retype/winco_complete_ot/\r\nhttp://www.re-type.com/fonts/fonts-winco.html\r\n\r\nOr
    are you looking for something hipper?\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/hipster-script-pro/\r\n\r\nOr
    something bolder and neon-y for a takeout shop? Can you give a hint about what
    direction you are leaning?."

    body: "Hi, \r\nThanks for this. So the physical location the client has in mind,
      is that this is going to be next to a basketball court, plus we'll have a wall
      of graffiti as mentioned before.\r\n\r\nI don't want to try to outdo graffiti
      style stuff. We can't go too hip hop. I'd like a nod to it, but w/o seeming
      like a poser (even though I used to write graffiti in the 80's!).\r\n\r\nIt's
      Soul Food, so the menu will be familiar, but with some slight variations.\r\n\r\nI
      do like winco, and it might find it's way as a supportive typeface if not a
      primary. Perhaps with a treatment behind it, or an outline, it might get loud
      in the right way.\r\n\r\nThe place will be called 'soul sammich' so I'm going
      to try mixing a bold 'soul' face, perhaps with a script. Maybe because the word
      'sammich' is non standard, a script could be used for 'soul' perhaps like a
      graffiti style script w/o overreaching.\r\n\r\nDoes that paint a clearer pic
      of the place? Any feedback helps, so thanks..."

  body: "Soul Sammich. I like it. \r\n\r\nWant to see some good examples? Come to
    Memphis and I'll drive you around. No offense intended to the other posters, but
    Hipster-script, hipster anything it is not. There's an inherent lack of stylish
    pretension in soul food. For the most part the hipness of all good soul food graphics
    is going to be hand-lettering and not typography. There's more soul in works by
    hand. When typography is used at soul food places, at least around the South,
    it's usually bad vernacular sign shop slop, which sometimes actually has it's
    own quirky charm, but most often is just plain lame and ugly. The best menus that
    set the mood are also done by hand. \r\n\r\nWe had a great soul sammich here called
    the Soul Burger, served at an ancient South Memphis whorehouse, now just a funky
    bar, called Ernestine & Hazel's. Unfortunately the owner killed himself a few
    weeks ago in the upstairs bar, which is allegedly  haunted. The new management
    says they'll continue unchanged, but we'll have to wait and see. \r\n\r\nI think
    you should maybe look for a few fonts for inspiration, but mainly stick with putting
    some funk in your pens and laying some ink on paper. (And stay away from haunted
    whorehouses.)\r\n\r\nThat's a fun project, enjoy it.\r\nD\r\n\r\n"
