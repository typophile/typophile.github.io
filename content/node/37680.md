body: 'I have an old novel by Dostoyevsky - The Insulted and Humiliated - printed
  by Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow. No date of publication is given.
  The impress of the letters is such that they can be felt with one''s hand on the
  page - like braille? - and the type often shows through from the reverse side of
  the page. Thin vertical bars occasionally appear between characters. It''s an otherwise
  handsome, and dare I say lavish, volume. I''d like to know (a) what typeface this
  is, and (b) has anyone attempted to simulate these printing effects in a digital
  medium? '

  body: "Yes, Literaturnaya looks to be the one ... I had a feeling Paratype might
    hold the answer. From their website: \r\n\r\nDesigned at NII OGIZ type design
    bureau circa 1940. Based on Latinskaya of the Berthold foundry (St.-Petersburg,
    1901), Cyrillic version of Lateinische of H.Berthold (Berlin, 1899). The digital
    version was developed at ParaType (ParaGraph) in 1996 by Lyubov Kuznetsova. The
    favorite text typeface of Soviet typography.\r\n\r\nThanks for the I.D."
