    Better&#44; I hope"> <BR> <BR>A zoomed out version of previous. I think that the
    font used in the &#39;published&#39; is the same as the &#39;The&#39; used at
    the top, but perhaps using a custom T or something like that.

  body: From the first sample, I thought the &#34;The&#34; might be typeset -- that
    &#39;e&#39; looks vaguely familiar, and a &#34;Th&#34; ligature like this is not
    unheard of. <BR> <BR>But from the second sample, I&#39;m now inclined to agree
    with Eduardo. All the rest of this is almost certainly handlettering. Look at
    all the different &#39;f&#39;s in the third line of the text, each one different.
    Or the &#39;R&#39;s in the last line. Or the three different &#39;the&#39;s throughout.
    <BR> <BR>This is all based on common models from the period, but I don&#39;t think
    you&#39;re going to find a font -- then or now -- which is exactly this. <BR>

  body: When I originally saw the &#34;Th&#34;-ligature, the works of  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=lucian%2Bbernhard"
    target="_blank"> Lucian Bernhard</a> immediately popped in my mind, so  <BR>if
    you want something similar that might be a place  <BR>where to start looking.

  body: Thanks to everyone for their help, much appreciated. I didn&#39;t know about
    the work of Lucian Bernhard, very interesting stuff.  <BR> <BR>On another note,
    does anyone know if Alexei Brodovitch&#39;s ALBRO font is available in a digital
    format? He used it in his 1950s magazine portfolio, of which 4 issues were published.
    I&#39;ll see that I get it scanned soon.
