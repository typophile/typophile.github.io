body: 'Hi, after many years of clutter and storing my font files in random locations,
  time has come to make a change. I am therefore looking for an application that can
  sort and organize my fonts automatically. I do not wish to use it as a font-management
  software, but only for sorting my typefaces in neat categories and folders. PS:
  I use Mac.'

    presently store all of my fonts on a USB key using a 'tiered folder system' I
    defined for myself and use NexusFont to browse and otherwise manage... NexusFont
    is only available for Windows at the moment."

  body: Personally I find it intensely rewarding to manually sort, categorise and
    organise font files and data. I am particularly fascinated by the smaller details
    to do with formats, foundry/origin and encodings. Sorry, I know this doesn't really
    help you but I sympathise with what you are trying to achieve. For what it is
    worth I approach this kind of thing from a fairly linear point of view, sorting
    alphanumerically and then by family, origin, format and version. Good luck!

  body: Id like to sort using the built in metadata in the font. I don't know what
    is the ultimate system of font sorting, but maybe Serif and Sans-serif at the
    top level. Then maybe Humanist and Geometric under Sans-Serif... I am guessing
    that there is no perfect solution for this. But which one is most common?

  body: "There is no \"most common\" format because designers cannot decide what criteria
    to use and which are the most important :D\r\n\r\nThe only method that is generally
    adopted as a data field in Truetype and Opentype fonts (so <em>not</em> in Type
    1 fonts) is PANOSE. You might give this Javascript a try, it's one for Illustrator:\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/message/4172363\r\n\r\nand
    see if it works for you (i.e., you have a font in mind and are able to find it
    using the script). If it does, then the Panose information is enough."

  body: "Display and text fonts, condensed, expanded, extra-light or black, low or
    high x-height potential usage (books, packaging, greeting card etc.). It depends
    a lot on how you use the fonts to how you classify them (of course). Though I
    find the designations like humanist, transitional etc. interesting, I hardly ever
    use them to pick a font. The 'emotional' qualities of font are more important
    to me (friendly, rough, playful, neutral...)\r\n\r\nI use Fontexplorer's classify
    function, to which I add a lot of own classifications. I sometimes use the smart
    set option to naarow down a selection based on some criteria (like: Serif, high
    x-height, text, low contrast)"

  body: If I might add to the question, I have a mac and I'm using Font Book to organize
    my fonts into different collections. I'd like to keep track of the different license
    files, since I have some free and some purchased fonts with different license
    types. Any suggestions?

  body: "I've used FontDoctor for years to organize my pool of fonts into a reasonable
    directory tree. It doesn't organize by category, but it does have options to organize
    by foundry and family name. It also does a wide variety of checks, conflicts,
    and repairs, which I think is useful.\r\n\r\nIt's now an Extensis product, available
    here: http://www.extensis.com/en/products/fontdoctor/index.jsp?ref=nav\r\n\r\nI
    know you're not looking for a font manager, but I advise rethinking that line
    you're drawing in the sand. FontExplorer (by Linotype) is really good, and attempts
    to do categorization. I don't think it's very successful at that (as others have
    pointed out, it's a hard problem), but it might be worth a download of the 30-day
    trial. It does have a good system for both regular and smart sets of collections
    of fonts; I use that to keep track of, for example, all my OpenType fonts.\r\n\r\n--John"
