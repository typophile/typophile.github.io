  body: That reminds me of [[http://www.dafont.com/search.php?psize=m&q=market+deco|Market
    Deco]]. It needs a lot of work if you want to use it well. Terrible kerning. The
    O isn't optically sized properly and some strokes look too fat.

  body: "As you have perhaps already noted, seeing your title, [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/collections/neutraface|House
    Neutraface]] Condensed versions would get you pretty close. The R is more like
    the original Neutraface, and the E is more like No. 2.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/mahlau/|Mahlau]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/newport-classic-sg/|Newport
    Classic]] are somewhat similar in feeling, perhaps. The flavor is Art Deco, I'd
    say.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
