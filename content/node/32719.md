  body: "Techno sans is just the category of font. Your thread title was probably
    changed because the original was too vague. I would suggest checking the techno
    sections at <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/\" target=\"_blank\">dafont</a>.\r\n\r\n

    href=\"forums/typeid/faq/#Q_10\"><strong>The subject line of my thread has been
    changed.</strong></a>\r\nThere's two possible reasons for that.\r\n<strong>One</strong>
    | The name you gave to your thread was very vague so we changed it into something
    better defined. This makes it easier for our type IDers to keep track of the different
    threads.\r\n<strong>Two</strong> | Your sample has been identified. Your thread
    gets tagged and we include the name of the typeface(s) you were looking for and
    the name(s) of the person(s) who IDed it/them for you. That way we don't need
    to needlessly open threads to check if there's still need for our services.\r\n\r\nSee
    reason 1. ;^)"

  body: To further explain -- we have people that are specialised in certain types
    of types (pardon the pun), that's why I often add a classification in the thread
    title.

    Lindholm's work. The enigmatic vaccubomb does not seem to be there.
