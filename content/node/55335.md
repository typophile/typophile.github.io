  (also known as version control (system) (VCS), source control or (source) code management
  (SCM)) is the management of multiple revisions of the same unit of information.
  It is most commonly used in engineering and software development to manage ongoing
  development of digital documents like application source code, art resources such
  as blueprints or electronic models, and other projects that may be worked on by
  a team of people. Changes to these documents are usually identified by incrementing
  an associated number or letter code, termed the \"revision number\", \"revision
  level\", or simply \"revision\" and associated historically with the person making
  the change. A simple form of revision control, for example, has the initial issue
  of a drawing assigned the revision number \"1\". When the first change is made,
  the revision number is incremented to \"2\" and so on.\r\n\r\n<em>distributed revision
  control</em>\r\n\r\nDistributed revision control (DRCS) takes a peer-to-peer approach,
  as opposed to the client-server approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single,
  central repository on which clients synchronize, each peer's working copy of the
  codebase is a bona-fide repository. Synchronization is conducted by exchanging patches
  (change-sets) from peer to peer. This results in some important differences from
  a centralized system:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>No canonical, reference copy of the codebase
  exists by default; only working copies.</li>\r\n<li>Common operations such as commits,
  viewing history, and reverting changes are fast, because there is no need to communicate
  with a central server. Rather, communication is only necessary when pushing or pulling
  changes to or from other peers.</li>\r\n<li>Each working copy is effectively a remoted
  backup of the codebase and change history, providing natural security against data
  loss.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<strong>relevance to type design</strong>\r\n\r\nIn-house
  most foundries probably use some form of revision control (right?)\r\n\r\nIt can
  be argued, however, that this traditional model of centralised revision control
  is insufficient for the more ad-hoc kind of collaboration open source development
  usually takes, were this model applied to type design. For discussion, see [[http://typophile.com/node/55128|this
  thread]].\r\n\r\n<strong>Common revision-control software</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Centralised</em>\r\n\r\nCVS
  was the first widely used free tool.\r\nSVN is the one that is currently ubiquitous.\r\n\r\n<em>Distributed</em>\r\n\r\nDarcs,
  Mercurial, Git and Bazaar are the main software packages used right now. All are
  free.\r\n\r\n<em>Web-based</em>\r\n\r\nThere have existed web-front ends for versioning
  servers for a long time. Until recently, however, they were used only to allow the
  browsing of the code.\r\n\r\n[[http://github.com|GitHub]] is among the first (the
  first?) to offer revision control software as a service. The added value this brings
  is the same as sharing photos on a site like Flickr: the ability to engage with
  the community, and the economy of scale that allows the developers to invest in
  the usability of the service. With Git as versioning software, the social aspect
  is especially relevant, since Git takes the opposite approach to traditional development
  cycles: <em>forking</em> becomes desirable instead of disadvantageous.\r\n\r\nTypophile
  @Klepas is probably the first to host a typeface on GitHub, as the intented collaborative
  platform for an open font. [[http://typophile.com/node/55128|A thread is going on
  regarding the relevancy of this effort.]]\r\n\r\nUsing GitHub is as trivial as geek
  gets, see http://klepas.org/openbaskerville/#using-git\r\n"
