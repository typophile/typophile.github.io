<p>Hear, hear.</p>
<p>Specifics to type design are indeed hard to come by, but I can think of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participating in (or even initiating) fund-raising efforts, like FontAid.</li>
<li>Functionality is a reflection of sobriety, something I for one feel we need more of today. So to me making a text font is more socially responsible than making a display font for example.</li>
<li>The making of fonts for endangered writing system - and really most of them are! For example when I make Armenian fonts, it&rsquo;s not for money, it&rsquo;s to help keep my culture alive. And I try to apply that sensibility when making fonts for scripts besides my own. And some future generation will have to do that for Latin&hellip;</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For me, social responsibility begins in the workplace. I don&rsquo;t think there is necessarily a single model of social responsibility to which type designers should conform, but certainly the way in which you organise your working relationships with other people should not be at odds with your beliefs about the organisation of society. Beyond the workplace, in relationships with other people and institutions, things get more complicated. For instance, Tiro operates as a free association of individuals in which no one profits from anyone else&rsquo;s labour, but most of the work we do is for companies that are based on capitalist models because, well, they’re the people who are paying.</p>
<p>There was an old Typophile thread on the subject ‘Who wouldn’t you work for?’, i.e. what clients or kinds of work would you turn down on ethical or other grounds.</p>

<p>Unless you donate at least some of the resultant proceeds

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are a lot of professions whose connections to social responsibility are hard to see. Would the world carry on fine if no new typeface designs were produced in the next 50 years? We would be able to &lsquo;survive&rsquo; without them, but quality of life would be diminished, the same way as if there were no new board games, flavors of ice cream, styles of clothes, or varieties of architecture. Creative professions push the culture forward, make people happy, and increase quality of life, and it&rsquo;s hard to discount that.</p>
<p>At the same time, I have been interested in how type design relates to the greatest threat of the 21st century, climate change. Unfortunately, for this particularly important issue, type design doesn&rsquo;t seem to offer much help. New type designs could help in communicating environmental issues through posters, videos and interactive media, but it seems the thousands of existing, fantastic typefaces would be more than up to the challenge. Graphic designers appear to be able to have more social influence than type designers, who make the tools designers use.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In the 1980s I attended a talk by F.H.K. Henrion in which he listed the responsibilities of a graphic designer.
I can&rsquo;t remember them exactly, but was impressed by the scope.
Something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do original work, to a high standard of quality</li>
<li>Educate the next generation of designers</li>
<li>Organize one&rsquo;s peers (industry bodies, trade shows, conferences)</li>
<li>Promote the profession to the trade and general public (public relations, competitions)</li>
<li>Cause marketing (he had designed wartime propaganda posters for the Ministry of Information (UK) - possibly &ldquo;Keep Calm and Carry On&rdquo;- and later  volunteered his services to causes he believed in, eg designing posters for Oxfam)</li>
</ul>
<p>Type designers have some catching up to do, but bear in mind that type design has only very recently become a viable full-time profession for more than a handful of people.</p>

How do you manage to control this? Are you going to censor your client’s text pieces?
This is rediculous.</p>
<p><cite>making a text font is more socially responsible than making a display font</cite></p>

<p>The idea being that in the former use, the typeface itself, and hence its designer, is becoming identified with something, while in the latter there is, among other things, a First Amendment issue.</p>
<p>Does anyone else see this as a valid distinction? Of course, one could say that this distinction is more concerned about the self-interest of the type designer for his own reputation than with social responsibility&hellip; but that&rsquo;s another can of worms.</p>

He is making and selling a licenses to use a product and reserves the right not grant such a license for certain uses. No one&rsquo;s freedom of speech is dependent on the right to license James' product. It&rsquo;s not as if he&rsquo;s making the only fonts in the world.</p>
<p>Further, the First Ammendment of the US Constitution says that <em>government</em> will not enact laws to limit the freedom of speech. It doesn&rsquo;t put any onus on private citizens to materially provide for the free speech of others. About as close as any jurisdiction gets to that is the California ruling that shopping malls, although private property, function as public spaces and hence owners cannot prohibit peaceful assembly, although they may limit them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I totally agree with John Hudson when he stands that &ldquo;social responsibility begins in the workplace&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not only a matter of doing a good job or just doing it well. It&rsquo;s about how we could contribute as we — type designers — are part of our society. We&rsquo;re not living in another Galaxy (although it might seem so ;-)
According to this responsibility, in the last years, I&rsquo;ve been involved in Arabic, taking into account the Arabic heritage of my country (Spain) and looking for some original historical roots that could help when designing an Arabic-Latin script. A research has been made in order to fulfill some basic requirements. It&rsquo;s not easy, indeed. But the most important thing is establishing a cultural &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; between our spanish culture and the increasing arabic population that is now living in Spain. 
Immigration is becoming a big problem in my country. A real stuff within the political agenda. There&rsquo;s a lack of tools in order to improve a better understanding among our cultures. I believe that typography, as a tool for communication, can help. That&rsquo;s the reason why I got engaged in this work. This is only a sample I just wanted to highlight. 
I could also talk about languages like Guaraní that are not considered within the unicode system yet. Type design can support this kind of &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; languages throughout the visibility of text.
I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;re other ways to contribute as part of our responsibility as designers. But, first of all, our responsibility is as people, as human beings sharing the same place.</p>

<p>&hellip;what kinds of social responsibility are needed to the typeface designer.[?]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I learned from a very senior experience designer at HP, that the most direct social responsibility we have is talking large scale distributors of mass products, out of &lsquo;cardboard shoes&rsquo;, which is something he was asked to design when he was young.</p>
<p>Type designers who can apply this to their work usually find a willing client, as large scale distributors of mass font products are usually paying top dollar, and what&rsquo;s a few extra hours to design in a rubber sole for the bottom end of the market.</p>
<p>Nick Shinn&rsquo;s list from F.H.K. Henrion is a superb next level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;“How would a typeface designer practice social irresponsibility?”
Example: Designing a display face for a new brand of cigarette.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think such subjective practices are a slippery slope, are not your business, and are beyond being well out of your control as a type designer.</p>

<p>Correct.</p>
<p><cite>aren&rsquo;t all font EULAs documents (contracts actually) that outline how and under what circumstances the font software may be used</cite></p>
<p>Even a legal EULA provision is only as good as one&rsquo;s ability to enforce it, and use-based restrictions are difficult that way. You can&rsquo;t know what people are doing with your font at all times, everywhere. (Though I&rsquo;d like to have a EULA provision that prevents horizontal scaling of more than ±10%.)</p>
<p>Also, if you dinged someone under your EULA for a forbidden message, the likely result is that they&rsquo;d pay you to settle the dispute, so you&rsquo;d end up profiting from their misuse anyways. Maybe the EULA would specify that they&rsquo;d have to donate to a nonprofit organization with a diametrically opposed viewpoint (!)</p>
<p>But aside from the practical issues, I agree with DB that in general, social responsibility is an awkward duty to impose on type designers. Responsibility can only be manifested through choices. The type designer&rsquo;s zone of choices is the typeface itself; everything beyond that is someone else&rsquo;s choice.</p>

<p>Guaraní is supported in Unicode. It requires use of combining mark characters, but that is true of very many of the world&rsquo;s languages. The use of combining mark characters can be made transparent to users, through keyboard layouts that assign multi-character sequences to single keystrokes and through language-specific editing, sorting, spellchecking, etc.</p>

<p>This is responsibility to that sector of society to which one belongs, determined by one&rsquo;s work.
It is a practical and relatively feasible social responsibility, not mediated through one&rsquo;s product to a vast abstraction.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect type designers to organize to represent their interests, AIGA/GDC style, anytime in the near future.
The idea of type designers as a professional group is quite new, as prior to e-commerce there were only a very few full-time type designers. So far, the mentality is very individualistic, as the economic model is based primarily on retail product, and is hence entrepreneurial. The belief is that if you aren&rsquo;t successful, it&rsquo;s not because the odds are stacked against you, but because your fonts and/or the way you market them isn&rsquo;t good enough. The solidarity that exists, protecting and promoting group interests, in professional organizations, is lacking.</p>
<p>Those industry organizations in which we do participate (e.g. ATypI) represent a variety of interests, many of which—such as the major corporate sponsors—conflict with those of type designers.</p>

<p>And even if not directly conflicting are certainly not the same interests. ATypI used to be a professional organisation of type companies &ndash; a cartel in fact &ndash;, but is now a social and educational organisation, open not only to people who work in the type business but also to those who buy type, work with type, like looking at type, etc. There are, broadly, three sets of economic interests represented &ndash; employers, employees and customers &ndash;, all at odds with each other.</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two major mode of work for type designers. One is a modern capitalist mode in which a type designer is a wage worker employed by people whose own business is not designing typefaces; in this category are those designers employed at companies like Monotype Imaging and Linotype, i.e. companies whose owners are not type designers. The second is the older artisan mode, in which master type designers own their own businesses and employ journeymen type designers (and may take on apprentice type designers too), albeit without the regulation provided by a guild (a journeyman is defined by his employment, not by certification). A good example of this mode is H&amp;FJ.</p>
<p>At Tiro, we&rsquo;ve tried to come up with a third mode in which workers individually own the means of production and no one is an employee. I don&rsquo;t imagine this would work for everyone: one has to value freedom higher than stability. No one is bound to Tiro, but by the same token we can&rsquo;t guarantee continuous work to all our associates. Then again, the stability of employment under those other modes is illusory, as those laid-off type designers who write to me asking if I have any work for them surely know.</p>

<p>The RGD (Association of Graphic Designers of Ontario) came into being despite your conditions (b) and (c).
Graphic designers in Ontario had conducted business before, and many had been members of the GDC, a national body.
The main impetus for the RGD was the threat of competition from &ldquo;unprofessionals&rdquo; without much ability, know-how, experience or educational qualifications, but with the latest software.</p>
<p>The piracy issue is a common interest for type designers, but it is a single issue.</p>

<p>That seems to me contradictory. If some foundries are making some serious retail money now, that must either be despite the work that type designers also do providing fonts to OEM distributors, or in some way actually contributed to by that work, e.g. by OEM distributed fonts exposing more potential retail customers to a richness of typographic variety. You&rsquo;ve been suggesting for years that OEM font distribution undermines retail font licensing, and yet OEM font distribution isn&rsquo;t getting less while you are acknowledging a growth in retail licensing income. Indeed, not only is OEM distribution not getting less, it is now supplemented by the growth of free and open source font distribution. That ‘serious retail money’ is being made within a diverse font business ecosystem, and without a systematic analysis of how that ecosystem works it isn&rsquo;t possible to say what the actual impact of one area is on another. I don&rsquo;t think it should be presumed that OEM font distribution ‘doesn&rsquo;t serve our best interests as a group’.</p>
<p>There are things that I instinctively think are probably not a good idea: retailing and OEM licensing the same fonts, for example, which is why I prefer a clean distinction between custom fonts and retail fonts, although recognising that product-specific OEM distribution may actually create a retail demand among users of other products, as was the case with the Microsoft C* fonts. [In that case, the issue is not of OEM negatively impacting retail, but of custom font development contracts not providing for the original designers to receive a share of subsequent retail licensing, in this case by a licensed third party. Something for people to think about when contracting custom font work.]</p>
<p>Another thing I think is wrong is the exploitation of libre and open source fonts by multi-billion dollar corporations like Google, who derive value from those fonts far in excess of the peanuts that they only sometimes offer to type designers. I think it is naïve to think that application of the free software model to creative works within a capitalist economy will result in anything other than the exploitation of those works by corporations whose capital resources enable them to leverage far more value from those works than the individual creator can. Giving away your fonts to people who can and should pay for OEM licensing is flat out stupid.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s how I see OEM licensing, however big the fee.
It&rsquo;s a one-time pay-off to surrender one&rsquo;s intellectual property.
I might see things differently if those who do it negotiated a royalty contract that was more in line with normal foundry retail returns.</p>
<p>You say there is no way to know if bundling is harm or help.
However, it seems obvious to me that any business deal one makes with a behemoth that doesn&rsquo;t score points is to one&rsquo;s disadvantage. And certainly to the disadvantage of one&rsquo;s peer&rsquo;s who weren&rsquo;t involved.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick: <em>It&rsquo;s a one-time pay-off to surrender one&rsquo;s intellectual property.</em></p>
<p>There are three distinct models of OEM font licensing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Non-exclusive corporate distribution license. In this case one isn&rsquo;t surrendering any intellectual property at all: one is simply granting a license that permits redistribution. Such a license may be linked to a specific volume of product for bundling purposes, specific number of downloads, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exclusive corporate distribution license. In this case one surrenders the right to sell licenses to other parties, whether corporate or retail; one may or may not surrender other intellectual property rights up to an including all rights, or one may surrender some rights only for a limited period of time. Obviously the size of the fee should be commensurate with the rights purchased.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that both of these models presume that what you have is a creative product for rights licensing, and the only difference between this and retail font licensing is the size of the fee and the rights granted under the license. OEM licensing of products in this way does not necessarily involve surrendering any intellectual property.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Custom or proprietary font development. This is the area I work in most of the time, and I see it as something quite distinct from corporate distribution licensing. This is contracted creative work, not product licensing, and the disposition of intellectual property rights varies considerably. Some clients want to completely own their custom typeface and be able to do anything with it that strikes their fancy, including distributing or even selling licenses themselves; in other words, they want to include in the contracted fee a transfer of all intellectual property rights. But this is not the case of surrendering intellectual property to the client &ndash; as would be the case if one were selling rights to an existing product &ndash;, because the intellectual property is only coming into existence because of the contract. Some clients do not see a need to assume all rights to the custom font, so long as they have the rights to use the font in the ways in which they need it, and hence the font developer gets to retain some or most rights, including the right to license the font to other customers, either immediately or at some future date after a period of exclusive use by the client. That&rsquo;s my favourite kind of work, because it means that all the font development is paid for up front, while the possibility of future income is retained. Obviously the fee for work under such terms is lower than if the client wishes to own the product outright.</li>

<p>Ross owns Euphemia and Plantagenet. They are distributed under license by Microsoft and Apple. Other fonts we have made for Microsoft as custom fonts, which they own outright (see below).</p>
<p>Recently we were approached by someone representing Google who wanted us to release Euphemia under a libre license for hosting on the Google web font server. I, after my fashion, gave them the long explanation of why we wouldn&rsquo;t be doing this and how I think the naïvité of free software enthusiasts is being taken advantage of by corporate capitalists. Ross gave them the short response: Google can obtain a corporate distribution license if they want, and will pay no less than Microsoft and Apple.</p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s a moot point. The fact is, the client is acquiring the intellectual property that the type designer has created, and could have just as easily provided under a less exclusive contract.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is a moot point, because in such cases the intellectual property in question would not have existed other than as a result of the contract. This is not speculative work or work produced and then licensed: it is contracted work, and since the client is specifically interested in owning such rights that is what they are a) looking to contract and b) willing to pay for.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t the case that the intellectual property inherent in the contracted work &lsquo;could have just as easily provided under a less exclusive contract&rsquo;. If it was that easy, don&rsquo;t you think we would regularly be doing so? The people with the money and the freedom to contract with whomever they choose are in effect able to dictate what it is that they will purchase. We can decline the contract, but we can&rsquo;t really dictate it. I suppose if there were an association whose bylaws prohibited members from selling intellectual property rights outright, then members could attempt to dissuade clients from seeking such and accept less exclusive terms of use, but I suspect the outcome would simply be that the clients would go elsewhere and contract with non-members, and probably at lower rates for poorer quality.</p>
<p>I believe the contracting of a private, custom typeface to which the client assumes all rights is a legitimate arrangement providing that the fee represents to the designer adequate remuneration for both the work done and the value of the intellectual property. Note also that the client assumes not only the rights but the responsibilities for defending and enforcing them.</p>
<hr>
<p>With regard to the notion of a professional association, I think the two dominant modes of type design work that I outlined above present a problem. The artisan mode suggests something like a guild, in which the responsibilities and rights of members at different levels of the the type business &ndash; masters, journeymen and apprentices in the traditional language &ndash; would be codified. But the proper organisation for wage workers in the capitalist mode is the trade or industrial union. I look forward to the arguments of Monotype management that type designers and hinters should not be members of the same union.</p>

<p>This is simply not true of Font Bureau. The only fonts which &ldquo;they have retained exclusive rights&rdquo; to, were where FB provided services to OEMs, on the designs of other vendors which had been licensed to the OEM in incomplete form. This went from Linotype Times for Apple through Mistral for MS. But from Gadget to Prelude, and there&rsquo;s something like 50-60 FB original fonts involved to Apple, MS and others, we have all the rights we had before the OEM license, and all the rights we&rsquo;ve granted to &ldquo;them&rdquo; are limited.</p>
<p>I will stop discussing whether replacing cardboard shoes with something better for masses of users.</p>
<p>But, please attempt to come to recognize that we are in different places on a spectrum. i.e. e.g. there are a lot more than two major modes of work for type designers, for sure;) and there are a lot more than two kinds of relationships between founders and OEMs.</p>

<p>Yes, a bundled typeface such as Didot may create demand for didone-style types, by both exposing and popularizing the genre, and also by stimulating those who want to be different to license other, commercial didones. But this is a small upside. If Didot were not supplied free bundled with the Mac OS, then all those who wanted to use a didone would have to pay to licence it, and that would have been a far larger market.</p>
<p>The demand for and interest in new and more sophisticated types is not something that was created by bundling non-cardboard fonts, but is a consequence of DTP technology, and the growing familiarity with typography, now that it is no longer a trade practised by a few, but is something anyone with a desktop computer can do.</p>
<p>If good bundled fonts had been restricted to Times and Helvetica, a diverse font industry would just as surely have evolved.</p>

<p>But a diverse font industry <em>has</em> evolved, and it includes people who specialise in custom and OEM font development. I suppose I could complain that you, by selling retail font licenses to end users so successfully are affecting my market for OEM font development: ‘surely’ it will reach a point when companies like Microsoft and Apple will think &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t need to bundle fonts with our products any more, everyone knows where to go to license the fonts they want&rsquo;. As I said before, absent a systematic analysis of different aspects of the font industry &ndash; and we work in a business that notably has no industry analysts &ndash;, we&rsquo;re not able to truly say what positive, negative or lack of impact one area has on another, nor are we able to say how this changes over time, nor are we able to claim that we&rsquo;re not simply expressing the biases or fears of our particular niche.</p>

<p>I was wary of large corporations long before I started a retail type foundry.
I doubt that the owner-designers of most retail foundries (which BTW I don&rsquo;t consider to be a niche) have a bias against, or a fear of bundling, most of them just get on with business, including OEM work if it comes their way.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Many years ago I opted to go and work as graphic designer and sign maker in a public transit agency. I did so in part because it paid well and the people I&rsquo;d be working for seemed pretty decent, but mainly because, of all the opportunities I came across, working in public transit seemed to be the most ethical and socially responsible one available to me. I designed and made signs, which are long-lasting items that don&rsquo;t usually end up in the landfill nearly as often as mailers, magazine ads and packaging. Plus my efforts all ultimately have contributed to sustainability long before that was a catchword. I still work there.</p>
<p>This is the ethos I try and bring to everything I do. Not that I&rsquo;m any good at it. I&rsquo;m just human, but the good intentions are there. In trying to carry them forward into designing type, it starts to become a little difficult to maintain any consistency though. It&rsquo;s like designing nuts and bolts. Fonts are raw materials that other people make things out of. If you design a really nice titanium bolt, you can have no more than symbolic influence over whether it will be used to build a search and rescue aircraft or a cruise missile.</p>
<p>To take up Hrant&rsquo;s earlier comments that designing text fonts is more responsible than designing display fonts and that a socially responsible thing type designers can do is to design fonts for endangered languages&hellip; Designing display fonts for endangered languages is not only ethical, it&rsquo;s noble. Every one deserves pretty posters and cigarette ads to look at&hellip; :o)</p>
<p>I recall that in Edmund Carpenter&rsquo;s book <cite>Oh What Blow That Phantom Gave Me</cite>, he wrote that many tribal cultures were dieing off because, compared to what the encroaching modern civilizations around them had to offer, Mom and Dad&rsquo;s culture was frankly, just plane old boring, if not dismal. It could not compete for the younger generations attention. A bit of a polish on the old ways (and scripts) can only help to preserve them.</p>
<p>Plus, signage fonts!! Last Year my wife and I drove through a First Nations reserve. The bilingual stop signs had the word &ldquo;STOP&rdquo; in a proper condensed highway font and below, in a scrawny hand lettered scrip, the native word for stop. If a people don&rsquo;t have the means even make a decent stop sign in their language, their language is all but dead.</p>

<p>Indeed, and as a diasporan Armenian parent I feel that daily. But I struggle to recommend simply giving in - there must be a balance, an intelligent and wise manipulation so that endangered cultures die neither from being abandoned out of disinterest nor from irrelevance by becoming too similar to dominant cultures. Some say it&rsquo;s a hopeless battle. But everything dies eventually. We must simply try - and luckily at the very least our efforts end up enriching even the dominant cultures - and that&rsquo;s socially responsible too.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As far as empowering minority languages goes, I&rsquo;ve done some of that, not so much out of social responsibility, but from the general principle of publishing fonts that aspire to, if not better, the standards set by Adobe.</p>
<p>Thomas Phinney outlined a utilitarian philosophy of character coverage at his Tyblography blog when he was at Adobe—the idea being something of a triage, but nonetheless covering a great many very small (in terms of users) languages, before the cut-off.</p>
<p>There is no doubt some megacorporation world domination strategy behind that kind of comprehensive coverage, but there is also an element of altruism. And technological inevitability, given the existence of Unicode and its incorporation into the massively accomodating OpenType format.</p>
<p>Another principle is that if a typographic feature is available in a typeface, it should be available in all weights, in all encodings. Fair&rsquo;s fair, and don&rsquo;t discriminate by privileging some languages over others.</p>
<p>That is why Scotch Modern Micro contains Bold Italic Small Caps with Swash Capitals for Mongolian Cyrillic, and the travesty of Greek Unicase!</p>
<p>It was a challenge, and the type designer&rsquo;s equivalent of fun, to do that—at least the first time…</p>

For example making an Italic for Armenian is far less useful than for Latin, especially if you believe that slant is integral to cultural authenticity (or at least differentiation) in Armenian so should ideally be a feature of the main &ldquo;Roman&rdquo; style (especially in a design with serifs).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Designers of Armenian type -at least the ones who notice there&rsquo;s a problem- are still working towards a good solution. But one big factor is that Armenian has a floating emphasis mark that can be placed on any vowel, so Italics for emphasis becomes non-critical. Personally I advocate (even for Latin setting actually) the free use of a Demi weight for contrast - the only caveat is you need to mind the repro quality lest the contrast is made too subtle. My reason to avoid &ldquo;Italic&rdquo; almost entirely, in any script, is based on two things: my suspicion of chirography in type; and the view that the informality of Italics isn&rsquo;t necessarily in tune with what a given Roman is trying to do. I&rsquo;ve explained this to the best of my ability in the Daidala interview:
<a href="http://www.daidala.com/25apr2004.html">http://www.daidala.com/25apr2004.html</a>
&quot;
If you believe that a typeface carries emotional associations in its forms*, then you have to conclude that the conventional practice of having only italics for emphasis is one-dimensional. There can be many kinds of emphasis, many nuances a discerning typographer might want to give snippets of text. So what would be nice is a system of fonts than can nest into each other and convey various emotions, such as stress, sensuality, whatever. What do italics convey? Mostly informality and motion – not necessarily what the text being marked is about.</p>
<ul>
<li>And if you don&rsquo;t, how do you justify making yet more fonts?
&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>I also think that the slanted-Roman (when done well, not Morison-style - and this was the topic of my TypeCon-LA talk) needs to be taken much more seriously, especially for something like Armenian.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the culturally un-authentic genres of Roman (in Greek)
and Small Caps (Cyrillic) have been adopted</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, a lot has gone wrong over time.  :-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Petrine reform</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sloppy, and impoverished.
And set a Cyrillic word in a body of Latin (or vice versa) and you&rsquo;re quite likely to hiccup - they&rsquo;re too close. Sure, a designer can make an effort to deviate the forms across scripts, but I feel the <em>spirit</em> of the Petrine reform is the opposite.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the abolition of &ldquo;polytonic&rdquo; Greek</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bad.
Same with the dumping of Greek&rsquo;s superb mega-ligatures.</p>
<p>HOWEVER:
The worthiness of a given reform of a script changes over time. For example the Petrine reform -although it could have been carried out much better- can be seen as a useful modernization of Russia, at that time. And there&rsquo;s little reason to fear for the near future of Russian culture. However soon in the future it might become a good idea to move away from Latin. For some design jobs it&rsquo;s a good idea even right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the type designer&rsquo;s responsibility is to be thoroughly
informed before stepping into the fray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, but also you can&rsquo;t be socially responsible without taking sides.</p>

<p>There may be more to this than a lack of fonts. My understanding is that when it comes to most of the First Nations people living in Canada, while there are occasional projects to teach the young people the language - still spoken by some of the elders - most First Nations languages <em>have</em> died, as far as being in daily use.</p>
<p>The one exception to that is Inuktitut, the language of Canada&rsquo;s Inuit, which is the first language of a large proportion of them, young or old.</p>
<p>@hrant:
You can&rsquo;t be socially responsible without <em>caring</em>, and that does mean taking sides on the issues involved. But <em>before</em> taking sides, if one really is socially responsible, one has to have taken the trouble to inform oneself accurately about the issues involved.</p>
<p>Some people feel they&rsquo;re being socially responsible when they oppose nuclear power. But I think they&rsquo;ve carelessly jumped on a bandwagon, without really checking if the safety concerns are real, and the net result of their activism may well be that, since ordinary people won&rsquo;t see a way we can do something about global warming without ruining the economy, that problem won&rsquo;t be addressed until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

<p>As well you and we all should be, for many reasons, and more than wary. But I was not responding to a general wariness towards the activities of large corporations, but to a specific claim that you have repeated over the years, which is that the bundling of fonts with other software is bad for the retail font business. I do not see evidence of that, and based on the state of the retail font business today my inclination would be to say that the impact of font bundling has probably been neutral or may have been beneficial. But this is only an inclination, and I wouldn&rsquo;t boldly claim either to be the case without systematic impact analysis. You, on the other hand, have repeatedly asserted that OEM font licensing &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t serve our best interests as a group&rsquo;, despite the absence of such an analysis, and in this thread have seemed to suggest, however obliquely, that an organised professional association for type designers should enact a policy against such licensing. Now, if there were such an association, it might commission an impact analysis of the various aspects of the font business by qualified and experienced analysts, but my guess is that the business is so small that we couldn&rsquo;t afford it. Most industry analysts work for investment firms, reporting on activity and development within major industries with substantial shareholder investment, and frankly that is a world I am much warier about getting involved with than making a product and selling it to a customer that happens to be a large software corporation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Indeed I wrestle with this myself. I see somebody showing a design in progress and clearly expecting -and often getting- mere suggestions for tweaks whereas I want to scream &ldquo;throw this junk away and start over!&rdquo; :-/  Sometimes I find a subtle way to say that (although I&rsquo;m sure it rarely sinks in) and sometimes I just look the other way (which just makes me feel weak and dirty) but once in a while I succeed (and of course not by myself but collectively with others) in communicating what might be worthwhile to keep in a design, and trying to get the designer to re-evaluate the whole thing, sometimes ending up with something actually worth producing. A good recent example is this: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/81730">http://typophile.com/node/81730</a></p>

<p>Yes, I think so, based on the basic economic principle that people aren&rsquo;t going to buy something which is free; and, according to my reading of the Competition Act, it also illegal in Canada, and probably many other countries that have fair trade laws.</p>

That&rsquo;s not a battle I am interested in fighting (along with piracy), I would rather spend my time making fonts.
Although I do like to discuss these issues at Typophile!</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to acquaint potential purchasers with your product by giving away free samples, you advertise it.
This is how the initial digital font market grew, by direct mail campaigns to graphics professionals—that was when fonts were sold on floppies, before the CD made it possible for bundle-spamming.</p>
<p>Adobe used to distribute a magalog, <em>Font&amp;Function</em> IIRC, which garnered a lot of font profit in the early &rsquo;90s.</p>

<p>Adobe have always avoided putting nodes at extrema if the result would distort the design, which is often the case in shallow curves, and as PS RIPs and Adobe&rsquo;s own screen rendering has become more sophisticated they&rsquo;ve taken greater liberties in this regard.

This has nothing at all to do with font bundling, which involves including within a single commercial product multiple pieces of software some of which are fonts.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, here is the section from the Competition Act:</p>
<p><em>“tied selling” means
(a) any practice whereby a supplier of a product, as a condition of supplying the product (the &ldquo;tying&rdquo; product) to a customer, requires that customer to
(i) acquire any other product from the supplier or the supplier’s nominee …
(b) any practice whereby a supplier of a product induces a customer to meet a condition set out in subparagraph (a)(i) … by offering to supply the tying product to the customer on more favourable terms or conditions if the customer agrees to meet the condition set out in either of those subparagraphs.</em></p>
<p>In order to get the free (&ldquo;more favourable terms&rdquo;) font, you have to buy the major application/OS.</p>
<p>The issue is not whether the font is otherwise readily available from its supplier at &ldquo;market price&rdquo;, but the the fact that it is distributed as a premium.</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue were it not for the dominant position of the vertically integrated supplier (see 78. 1 (a))
For instance, giving away a year&rsquo;s free gas with the purchase of some car models is not going to put Shell out of business—but it would be another matter if every car Ford sold came with free gas forever. Now, if this were the Economy gas, David would argue that it would encourage people to upgrade to Premium…</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t recall using the word MUST; AFIK, the PostScript font specification describes what produces OPTIMAL results, both in terms of rendering and hinting. In the thread I referenced, I took one section of an outline which lacked at orthogonal extremum, added it and massaged the handles a bit. When I overlaid the two at 1,000 pts. using Photoshop&rsquo;s DIFFERENCE filter, the difference ranged from zero to half a pixel, hardly the definition of recognizable, apparent or meaningful distortion.</p>
<p>If you recall an exchange we had about QWERTY keyboards, I stated that the design was chosen to slow typists down so that they didn&rsquo;t jam those early mechanical clunkers; you disagreed, but allowed that the design was sub-optimal. Now, as then, I fail to see a recognizable, apparent or meaningful distinction between &ldquo;deliberately clumsy&rdquo; and &ldquo;sub-optimal.&rdquo; It appears that sub-optimal fonts don&rsquo;t bother you, either. Fine: to each his own.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Oldnick, the language of technical standards makes conventional use of certain terms, often capitalised, to indicate different levels of conformance requirement. So, for instance, there is a distinction between MUST and SHOULD. So, let&rsquo;s look again at what you wrote:</p>
<blockquote>A few months back, I mentioned in a post that several characters in Adobe Garamond Pro didn't conform to PostScript specs, specifically for nodes at the extrema. As it happens, a BIG NAME was responsible for the design, so a fair number of apologists spoke up, excusing the situation, with arguments like "PostScript specs are only guidelines" and "the exigencies of production precluded strict conformity," etc.</blockquote>
<p>Can you see how the wording of the spec, with regard to MUST vs. SHOULD would have an impact on the reasonableness of the responses you received (leaving aside your unpleasant presumption of the motivation of those responses)? The reason I asked whether you could direct me to a PostScript font specification that says extrema MUST have nodes is that such a technical requirement would make the responses you received invalid. But I am not aware of any such technical requirement. I&rsquo;m not even sure that the PS font spec uses the term SHOULD, but rather makes some recommendations for rendering and hinting purposes, neither of which are static purposes and hence my comment about changes to RIPs and screen rendering methods, which make hinting and hence extrema nodes less critical than they were when the original PS font spec was written. Maybe the spec should be updated and reworded to record current recommended or accepted practices? Personally, unless a spec is going to say MUST, I&rsquo;d prefer it to give examples of different approaches and what their expected outcomes are, so that font developers can make informed decisions about what practices to adopt under what circumstances.</p>
<p>When I am making fonts, I always seek to place nodes at extrema, and will only not do so if I find that this distorts a shallow curve. Adobe, as I said, have long taken a more liberal approach. I put nodes at extrema because I like being tidy and also because a lot of my work ends up being produced as TrueType, within which nodes at extrema is much more important than it is in PostScript fonts today. Indeed, in some TrueType glyphs I am obliged to put nodes on an extreme even if this produces an unwanted distortion of curve quality, in order to provide an accurate bounding box.</p>
<hr>
<p>What vitriol? I was trying to suggest that your rhetoric seemed to be getting away from you. Really: &lsquo;speaking truth to power&rsquo;, &lsquo;peril&rsquo;? Doesn&rsquo;t that seem a bit over-the-top to you in retrospect? I find such rhetoric makes it very difficult to have a reasonable discussion, and over the years I have watched too many conversations spiral into such language, with people ceasing to speak to each other but only to declaim portentous clichés. I used to do it to, but am trying not to any longer.</p>
<p>You seem inclined to unjustly ascribe to vile motivations to people who disagree with you. Can&rsquo;t someone just think you are wrong about something without being accused of belonging to an Old Boy&rsquo;s Club or protecting a BIG NAME?</p>
<p>Who is in this Old Boy&rsquo;s Club? Of the people in the present discussion who might be considered such on the grounds of being colleagues of longstanding, we have Nick who believes that some of the ways in why my fonts are distributed are harmful to the type business (despite not providing evidence of such impact) and should be considered illegal under existing laws, and we have David who, if I read him correctly, thinks my fonts are bullshіt and that I&rsquo;m a kowtowing corporate sycophant. Sheesh&hellip; is there some way out of this club?</p>

It probably is sub-optimal as a layout for electronic keyboards, but it was designed to be optimal for mechanical typewriters <em>at speed,</em> and my only contribution to that thread was to point out that you had repeated an urban legend that the layout was designed to slow typists down; on the contrary, it was designed to enable them to type as quickly as possible on a typebar system.</p>

<p>To which David responded: <em>This is so 19th century and blind to spectrum analysis, much less spectrum awareness.</em></p>
<p>And to be honest I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what they were talking about, but I reckon they&rsquo;re both right in their way. By way of context, a quote from a 2006 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/business/yourmoney/26every.html?ex=1165554000&en=02ed48ae1473efe0&ei=5070">NYT interview</a> with multibillionaire investment genius Warren Buffett:</p>
<blockquote>There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.</blockquote>
<p>I agree with David in that I think it is essential to appreciate and try to understand the full complexity of the social and economic relationships in which people now live, and the sometimes conflicting interests that these generate even for individuals. I agree with Hrant in that I believe those very complexities have often been deliberately engineered to divide and conquer.</p>

<p>It is indeed an interpretation, as the law hasn&rsquo;t really caught up with digital yet.
But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s perverse, as the Competition Act is all about fair play, and my main objection to font bundling by megacorporations is that it&rsquo;s unfair to retail foundries.
Idiosyncratic I always consider a compliment, thanks!</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m not making a campaign of this, just discussing it in an impersonal manner at Typophile, once in a while, if it has some relevance to a thread someone else has started.
When I went after Helvetica in 2003 I spoke against it at ATypI and wrote magazine articles deconstructing its hegemony. 
Did my advocacy for new type design help lead to the present profusion of originality, or would it have happened anyway?
Nonetheless, Helvetica is still number 1 at MyFonts.</p>

<p>It ain&rsquo;t so. Conspiracy implies secretive, behind-the-scenes machinations. I was referring to quite open policies that, for example, permit unionisation only along trade lines rather than industrial lines, encourage better-paid workers to consider themselves &lsquo;middle class&rsquo; rather than working class, call people who get paid minimum wage to pour coffee &lsquo;associates&rsquo;, treat truck drivers as independent contractors in order to avoid paying benefits or allowing them to join the teamsters, etc. This isn&rsquo;t conspiracy: this is business as usual. The apparent complexity of socio-economic relationships these policies create serve to obscure the fact that the dominant relationship remains that between the working class and the employing class, which is a relationship of contrary interests and hence of struggle. As Warren Buffett pointed out, while the working class are dissuaded from even mentioning class war, the rich are relentlessly waging it.</p>

<p>Or, more cynically still, &lsquo;We recognise that a significant portion of consumers like to think that they are being socially responsible, so we&rsquo;ll make it easy for them to think that by investing in a PR campaign to say that we are&rsquo;. The phenomena of &lsquo;greenwashing&rsquo; is a good example of this. A parallel is the recognition by processed food companies that a lot of consumers want to believe that they are eating healthy, low-fat food, which in the United States &ndash; where companies are allowed to self-regulate food labelling &ndash; leads to packaging proclaiming hydrogenated bundles of sugar and salt to be &lsquo;A healthy snack&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I disagree that making money and being socially responsible are <em>necessarily</em> conflicting goals. If this were true, there would be no basis at all for ethical investing, fair trade, progressive labour practices, co-operative ownership etc., which typically involve investors and companies willingly putting social policies before maximisation of profit. In other words, you can run a socially responsible business if you have a concept of <em>enough</em> when it comes to profit: kind of like how you can be a healthy individual if you have a concept of enough when it comes to eating.</p>

<p>John — the biggest China-only component is the display. You had a choice in 04-05 and since, to support better use of font tech we have and move to the next level of great font tech, or do nothing (about type design for screens, about font formats, and about web font formats). When your platform loses the competition you&rsquo;ve been promoting, become socially responsible?</p>
<p>The train left the station when I said it would. If you want to imagine my picture of the horror: the Han are going to work their minorities to death in display factories from Tolkien&rsquo;s dark side because font formats are too stupidly deployed to help anyone, except the dickheads who believe in rendering and resolution competition.</p>

<p>Ultimately I&rsquo;m skeptical that social responsibility can or should exist in the business context. Businesses exist to make money. Economic incentives inevitably take precedence over other considerations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree. I interviewed Aaron Feuerstein, owner of Malden Mills, in 2000. He is famous as an example of corporate responsibility and social responsibility because of his paying his workers for a year after his factories burned down in 1995. His legacy is complicated because of his eventually losing control of his company, and it going into bankruptcy in 2002. How much this had to do with his decisions after the fire, and how much to do with his creditors not being willing to extend credit to a CEO over 80 years old, I don&rsquo;t know. I do know that he very successfully ran the company for 50 years before the fire, when most manufacturing had fled New England, and much had fled the US.</p>
<p>If you look at his success in being socially responsible to his workers and the communities around him for fifty years before the fire, there is no doubt that it is possible to make a lot of money and be socially responsible. Feuerstein made clear to me that pursuing social responsibility—which he takes to be a moral obligation, in and out of business—and profit were his goals. Putting the two together requires a real creative effort, and success in either, much less both, is difficult. But to say that it is impossible is not correct, and I fear gives people an excuse not to try.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, in Jewish ethics there are both prohibitions (commandments &ldquo;not to do,&rdquo; such as not to murder or bear false witness) and positive injunctions (commandments &ldquo;to do,&rdquo; such as to love your neighbor as yourself.) Generally speaking the prohibitions are more sharply defined, and easy to recognize. So I would say that when it comes to working for others, one should avoid those you find really odious or morally reprehensible. But beyond that, I think it&rsquo;s hard to say, because if you only would work for angels, you wouldn&rsquo;t have many clients. Michael Bierut talks about developing a base of clients you like and can work with well. Of course, his talent and success makes that easier for him to achieve, but maybe his approach has also help him to be successful, it&rsquo;s hard to say.</p>
<p>Feurstein told me that if you want to make a quick buck, not caring about ethics can help you. But if you want long term success, that depends on building trusting relationships, and there a sense of responsibility and caring pays off in the long run. That corresponds to Bierut&rsquo;s advice about developing clients with whom you have a good—in several senses—relationship.</p>

<p>Sure. My point was only that rationally operated businesses will never choose a socially valuable option that doesn&rsquo;t also lead to profit. And that&rsquo;s not cynicism — it&rsquo;s just an acknowledgment that businesses don&rsquo;t have the same freedom of choice that an individual does.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also why we should be cautious about holding up the activities of any business as a model of socially responsible behavior. It&rsquo;s just not in the gamut of possibilities, and sets the bar low. It&rsquo;s like holding up McDonald&rsquo;s vegetarian options as a model of healthy cuisine.</p>
<p><cite>If this were true, there would be no basis at all for ethical investing, fair trade, progressive labour practices, co-operative ownership etc., which typically involve investors and companies willingly putting social policies before maximisation of profit</cite></p>
<p>Are they? Seems to me that you never have to scratch a socially progressive business policy too deeply to find the profit motivation underneath. But maybe that&rsquo;s my US bias.</p>
<p>Or the example of Mr. Feuerstein. He kept his employees on payroll — so he could rebuild his textile mill. He didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this insurance money and send all you employees to college so you can get better jobs,&rdquo; or open an orphanage, etc.</p>

<p>I think that presumes a particular model of a business, which is the corporation that, by legal fiction, is a &lsquo;person&rsquo;, thereby isolating the <em>actual persons</em> who are the owners, officers and staff of that corporation, both legally and psychologically, from responsibility for the <em>actual choices</em> that they make. Other models of business have existed and continue to exist. New models of business are possible. The corporation model is as widespread as it is because it maximises profit and power for the people who create corporations and who through both direct and indirect means shape government policy and legislation to favour that model, while minimising their exposure to being held individually responsible for their activities. The most pernicious aspect of this seems to me the way in which the model infiltrates all areas of social life, entangling the citizenry as well as the government in its mechanisms, e.g. through RSP contributions, which effectively make it impossible for people to financially provide for their old age without engaging with the stock market mechanism.</p>

<p>Of course, which is why &ndash; contra David &ndash; I&rsquo;m not &lsquo;blaming Apple&rsquo;, they just happen to have provided the recent media flashpoint for exposure of Foxconn&rsquo;s labour practices, and their massive cash reserve means that they can hardly make the claim that they can&rsquo;t afford other options or that they&rsquo;re only observing their responsibility to shareholders.</p>
<hr>
<p>David: <em>If you want to imagine my picture of the horror: the Han are going to work their minorities to death in display factories from Tolkien&rsquo;s dark side because font formats are too stupidly deployed to help anyone, except the dickheads who believe in rendering and resolution competition.</em></p>
<p>&hellip;which is every software and hardware company. Do you see any of them not treating rendering and resolution as areas of competition?</p>
<p>Thanks for your picture of the horror, but I don&rsquo;t think Orwell&rsquo;s needs to be replaced.</p>
<blockquote>If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever.</blockquote>
<p>The notion that a change in font format deployment or rendering standardisation could &lsquo;help anyone&rsquo; in terms of the treatment of indentured factory labour in China is laughable.</p>
<p>The original question is this thread regarded what kinds of social responsibility might be appropriate or particular to type designers. Now, I think you can and perhaps should make a case for standardisation of screen rendering and font display as a social responsibility, and I would likely sign up to that. Once again, I do <em>not</em> think competition in that area is beneficial to readers and have only ever pointed out that the software companies persist in treating it as an area of competition so you/we would have a long hill to climb, and I wouldn&rsquo;t give good odds on reaching the summit.</p>
<p>But I think that there are more basic issues of social responsibility &ndash; not particular to type designers, and nothing whatever to do with fonts and screens &ndash; that have to do with how we organise our working lives and our relationships with those we work with, work for or who work for us, as the case may be. As I wrote near the beginning of the thread, I don&rsquo;t think there is necessarily a single mode of working that is &lsquo;socially responsible&rsquo;, but a) modes of work should be subject to critique on the basis of concepts of social responsibility, and b) individuals should try to order their own working relationships in ways that correspond to their beliefs.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hrant: <em>China is very materialistic &hellip; but it&rsquo;s not capitalistic.</em></p>
<p>Do the workers in the factories own the means of production? No, they do not. The means of production are owned by the owners of capital, whether Chinese or foreign, or by the state, which operates in a global capital market. So of course China is capitalist. They&rsquo;re authoritarian state capitalist instead of democratic liberal capitalist, but they&rsquo;re in the same business of directing the lives of billions of human beings to create wealth for the benefit of the owners of capital.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Your first point is accurate, but it leaves out the question of time and risk, which are critical. You may risk less profit for the sake of good treatment of your employees, or the good of the community. And you may think there is a good chance that as a result your long term profit will be satisfactory, or even better.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is whether you are <em>only</em> trying to solve the problem of profit or <em>also</em> trying to be at the very least ethical, and at most to be helpful to others beyond the company. So the question is whether you look for ethical solutions, and what risks you are willing to take for their sake. The fact that any responsible business leader needs to see that he or she continues to have cash or credit to operate doesn&rsquo;t make the ethical dimension irrelevant.</p>
<p>Feuerstein emphasized that responsible leadership of a business involves both profit and ethics. He never considered just one, but always both. And his long term success in both shows that it is possible to combine the two.</p>
<p>As far as capitalism goes, when I have discussed the case of Feuerstein with others, some have argued that it was critical Feuerstein owned the business himself. Because of that, he had a lifetime and beyond time horizon, whereas often managers of publicly owned companies are only looking to boost their stock price in the short term, so they can cash out in a few years. For example the GM management seems to have plundered the company for decades, sacrificing both employees and long term profit.</p>
<p>So to me just talking about capitalism misses the more profound issue of the structure of ownership and its relations to other laws and institutions in the society.</p>
<p>I know enough about the complexity of China not to make pronouncements. David, I think that most factory workers in China are Han Chinese—92% of the population—not minorities. Huge numbers are migrant workers, often without residence permits, which is a huge social problem.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think we disagree. My nuance was that social responsibility, as practised by companies that make this a matter of policy rather than a matter of public relations, affects the kind and levels of profit that are obtainable. What might be termed the classical capitalist approach to profit was succinctly expressed in 1911 at the shareholder meeting of the American Woolen Company</p>
<blockquote>Any man who pays more for labour than the lowest sum he can get them for is robbing his stockholders. If he can secure men for $6 and pays more, he is stealing from the company.</blockquote>
<p>And more recently by Milton Friedman, with the scare tactic that anything other than maximum profit is an assault on freedom &ndash; tell that to the millions in indentured slavery:</p>
<blockquote>Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundation of our free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social responsibility other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible.</blockquote>
<p>But various kinds of businesses now operate with the specific policy of ensuring a reasonable income &ndash; a living wage or a proportionate share of profit &ndash; to the workers whose labour generates the wealth, and they do so specifically <em>to attract shareholders who care about such things.</em> Yes, the intent remains to make a profit, but the same shareholders could just as easily invest in other companies with higher returns. They choose a lower profit in return for knowing that their money is contributing to a social good, or at least is not contributing to the misery of another human being.</p>

<p>Can font-making be socially responsible? I guess. But personally, I say, give me a break. I understand that fontmaking is an art that requires a great deal of time. But I think this is exactly what throws it off from being socially responsible. Who buys fonts? Not me - I can certainly not afford to buy 100 or so glyphs for the cost of $30 a buck, especially when there&rsquo;s a lot of free ones available, even if their y&rsquo;s tail isn&rsquo;t perfect or something. In that case, professional fontmaking is already a creator of elitism. But anyways, it&rsquo;s presumably graphic design businesses who are trying to make a profit by virtue of being a business. So it&rsquo;s the patronized artists judging everyone else. Except in this case, 99.9% of people don&rsquo;t realize fontmakers are artists at all.</p>
<p>And I think another problem is that if a font maker is socially responsible with their works, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping someone from doing something with another font, especially when the big-name fonts have no such limitations. It&rsquo;s like a guitar-maker needing to stop someone from making bad music with that guitar, when plenty of other guitars are available.</p>
<p>And to all of you who denigrate capitalism, what do you think is suitable for replacing it? Anarcho-communism, isn&rsquo;t it? Hm&hellip;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that most people don&rsquo;t realize fonts are made by people and are worth something.

<p><cite>Yes, I think so, based on the basic economic principle that people aren&rsquo;t going to buy something which is free; and, according to my reading of the Competition Act, it also illegal in Canada, and probably many other countries that have fair trade laws.</cite></p>
<p>Based on that, not only is it illegal to include <em>fonts</em> with a copy of Microsoft Windows, it&rsquo;s also illegal to include Notepad, WordPad, or Solitare with Windows.</p>
<p>And if they didn&rsquo;t include a copy of Internet Explorer with Windows, just how would I download Firefox? Oh, I suppose I could dig out a CD with an old copy of WS-FTP, and hope that I could look up the address of Mozilla&rsquo;s FTP site in a book in the library&hellip; actually, of course, I could always use an older computer with a copy of Netscape 3.1 on it, but not everyone has more than one computer.</p>
<p>It can, therefore, be argued that fonts are <em>essential</em> to the functioning of an operating system - and, in fact, <em>some</em> fonts - at least bitmapped ones, if not TrueType ones, certainly are because in Windows (as opposed to DOS) you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to see what you&rsquo;re typing on the screen without one - and thus including a typestyle with an operating system is as natural as doing so with a <em>typewriter</em>.</p>
<p>In any case, this would likely drum up more business for the free amateur font sites - and more people would download open-source fonts - in fact, the end result would probably be that something like the TeX Gyre collection would become the standard instead of what Microsoft provides.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s those commercial 1001 font CDs. Finally, money actually changing hands. <em>There</em> you are. The economic beneficiary of what you&rsquo;re proposing.</p>
<p>Not - in a million years - real type designers like you.</p>
<p>It is true that you could charge lower prices for your fonts if many more people were buying them. So, maybe &ldquo;real&rdquo; type foundries could charge prices low enough that the 1001 font CDs wouldn&rsquo;t come into being. Even that wouldn&rsquo;t help you much, because the only people inconvenienced by fonts not coming with Windows&hellip; would be looking for the old standbys. Times Roman, Garamond, Baskerville, Bodoni, Caledonia, Optima, Helvetica, Univers, Franklin Gothic, News Gothic, Goudy Old Style, Albertus, Peignot&hellip; and so on and so forth&hellip; and if Papyrus were thrown in, they wouldn&rsquo;t sneeze at it.</p>
<p>Anything new or original&hellip; would be the province of professional typographers that feel themselves qualified to judge the merits of that which is new and original.</p>
<p>@dberlow:
<cite>the Han are going to work their minorities to death in display factories from Tolkien&rsquo;s dark side</cite></p>
<p>I am no fan of the regime in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, nor of their treatment of Tibetans and Uighurs. However, the overwhelming majority of employees in factories producing cheap products for export from China <em>are</em> ethnic Han Chinese - and even speakers of Mandarin.</p>
<p>China is far too poor, and too populous, for only its minorities to be working long hours for a pittance while everyone else gets paid decently for their work. Compared to the peasants working the land - also mostly Han - the ones exploited in the factories are the lucky ones.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s the not inconsiderable matter of high def video and games, which are very much driving all aspects of hardware development today (cf. the Open Font Format spec being part of the MPEG4 video format). Indeed, the mess that we&rsquo;ve ended up with in type rendering is only part of the fallout of that video/game driven push. The poor scalability of most desktop OS user interfaces to high resolution is another byproduct: simply put, the resolution requirements for games and video have already marched far beyond the capabilities of legacy OS design. More and more and more pixels per inch is happening regardless of typography, and better options for low resolution typography is not going to discourage that one little bit.</p>
<p>As to advising OS makers, I tell all my client upfront what will and will not work with the software environments they are proposing to use, whether they built those environments themselves or not, and what would be necessary for font makers to be able to truly optimise for screen reading experience. And if they&rsquo;re OS makers, they invariably say &lsquo;Yes, we understand, but this is what we&rsquo;re doing&hellip;&rsquo;. And what they are doing is pushing higher resolutions and faster hardware, presumably because new hardware, high def video, and games games games is where the money is (cf. Matthew&rsquo;s comment re. rationally operated businesses). Since they believe that some magic threshold resolution will also solve the type rendering mess, they perhaps consider that <em>not</em> investing in improving low resolution type display is actually solving the problem by encouraging it to go away, eventually, maybe one day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not spending my time advocating better use of low resolution for type because I consider it futile given all the factors driving high resolution, not because I disagree with you that it would be worthwhile if type were the only factor to consider. You may be right about absolutely everything, David, &ndash; I respect you enough to consider it a credible possibility &ndash; but I still think your being right would have absolutely no effect on the course being steered by them over there.</p>

<p>As in periods of early industrialisation elsewhere, the distinction in China between peasants and factory workers isn&rsquo;t a clean one. Just as many of the women working in the textile mills of Massachusetts a hundred years ago were farm girls, working in the off-season or for just long enough to save some money and improve their marriage prospects back home, so there is a huge contingent of peasants in China who spend part of each year working in factories, mines or other industrial labour to augment their income. An interesting situation arose some years ago in which companies were trying to keep these workers in the factories and dissuade them from going home to their villages for the traditional Spring Festival by withholding their wages. The government stepped in, interestingly, on the side of the peasant workers, introducing regulations that required companies to pay the workers in time for them to go home. This speaks to something that is overlooked if you think about the &lsquo;luck&rsquo; of factory workers vs. peasants only in terms of relative income: there is a long-standing tradition of popular protest among the peasants &ndash; there are thousands of local protests across China every year recently, against local corruption, loss of arable land to industry, commodity pricing, etc. &ndash; and the government frequently tries to accommodate the farmers' demands, most commonly by replacing local Party officials, because ultimately they need the farmers to feed the population. The government also recognises that allowing the peasant workers to return to their villages with the money they have been able to save from factory work contributes to local economies. The relationship between land and city in China is still a lot more fluid than it has become in North America and Europe.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, while some Chinese migrant workers to go back and forth, many of them stay in the city except for the week long holidays of Chinese New Year and National Day. And many families are separated for very long periods—a heartbreaking situation that most of us can&rsquo;t imagine putting up with, but which is common in China.</p>
<p>[[http://www.china-labour.org.hk/en/node/100259|Here is a pretty informative article about the Chinese labor situation and migrant workers.]]</p>
<p>As to whether they are better off in factories, the wages are so much better in these than in farm work the people keep coming into the cities, 13 million a year [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_worker#China|according to the Wikipedia.]] The factories are, as you can see in the article, not fun places to work. But how many have dangerous conditions, I don&rsquo;t know. The organization I linked to, in Hong Kong, has extensive information.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues in China with migrants concerns the houkou, the residence permit. Starting in the &rsquo;50s you had have one to get a ration card and government services—in the place where you live only. Now people are streaming into the cities without a residence permit, and their are threatening to become a second lower class of citizen, because their children don&rsquo;t have a right to attend the state schools, and every other kind of government service. Even though they are internal migrants, their situation is similar to illegal central American immigrants into the US, but the numbers are not in the millions, but hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>The government of China is extremely worried about how to deal with this problem, and has taken steps to improve the lot of waidi, those without a permit. But the permit system is still on place. Abolishing it would mean the cities would have to provide schooling and other services for all the migrants, so it is not a trivial thing to do.</p>

<p>Oldnick, those kinds of labour practices persist in many parts of the world. In fact, they persist wherever companies can get away with them, and it certainly wasn&rsquo;t a voluntary change that brought an end to such practices in the US. Corporate interests in America continue to try to roll back fair labour legislation, as the folk of Wisconsin recently discovered, in the process <a href="http://www.smartcitymemphis.com/2011/05/european-companies-slumming-in-america/">attracting European companies to operate in America in ways in which they would never do at home</a>.</p>

They were following a path to hint-able fonts, but had not yet integrated that.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the second foundry, in the countryside of the big China, they were cutting punches and stereotyping on the ground level, and on dancing break from their Macs in their white lab coats upstairs. I hope all&rsquo;s well.</p>

<p>Really big yawns notwithstanding, the latest figures I&rsquo;ve seen (from February of this year) estimate that American businesses are holding on to almost two TRILLION dollars of cash (enough money to eradicate world hunger ENTIRELY for ten years), while thirteen million-plus American workers are out of jobs. Furthermore, tight credit is preventing many small businesses&ndash;the traditional creators of new jobs&ndash;from obtaining money to do what they do best.

<p>Countries like Zimbabwe are desperately poor because the government confiscates wealth from productive businesses to give to the tribes that prop up the dictatorship militarily - so no one would be helped by the U.S. following its example.</p>
<p>Reasonable and equitable taxes, some of which are spent on foreign aid and domestic poor relief, however, do have a place. The distribution of wealth and income in the early 1960s represented a healthy society, and we have moved to dysfunctionality in this area. But noting that American businesses have X amount of dollars in hand in a context implying that the best thing the government could do is grab it all will only promote notions that don&rsquo;t help anyone.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone implied a that a government grab of corporate wealth would be the best thing, despite the binary choice of unfettered capitalism or state socialism presented as the only options by Fox News. Oldnick&rsquo;s solution, insofar as he implied anything at all, would seem to involve increasing credit to small businesses.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t take his statement about eradicating world hunger to be a suggestion that the money could be effectively employed in this way, let alone that it was up to some government to do this: I took him simply to be giving an impression of the size of the sum involved. For most people, two trillion dollars isn&rsquo;t a sum that is easy to relate to any exchangeable notion.</p>
<p>Note also that he said hunger, not famine. Most people in the world who suffer from hunger and malnutrition (not always the same thing) are not in a state of famine, they&rsquo;re just too poor to afford enough to eat, or the right sort of food, or to have access to land on which to grow their own food. They may live in countries that produce and export huge amounts of food to the rest of the world, even work in agriculture in those countries &ndash; usually for foreign owned corporations &ndash;, and still suffer from malnutrition due to not being paid a living wage. The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/31/global-food-crisis-guatemala-system-failure">recent Guardian article on Guatemala</a> presents a challenging picture of hunger in the midst of plenty.</p>
<p>With regard to the ‘green revolution’, yes it has been very successful in some areas, but more in terms of producing singular export crops than producing the diversity of things that local people need to eat and be healthy. This means it offers little in terms of food security. That kind of heavily mechanised agriculture is highly dependent on cheap energy sources and, hence, susceptible to the kinds of energy crises we seem likely to face in the near future as oil prices increase and alternative energy technologies only gradually become economically viable. This is true not only of the mechanisation of cultivation and harvesting, but also of the costs associated with transport of produce to markets.</p>
<p>Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba had some of the most successful and intensive mechanised agriculture in the world, but almost over night they lost their access to subsidised fuels &ndash; as well as to the chemical fertilizers on which the intensive farming relied &ndash; and simply in order to feed themselves were obliged to break that system down, encourage local sustainable agricultural practices, cultivate land within cities to reduce the distance from field to market, etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, calling Cuban agriculture under the Soviet subsidy a success is highly misleading, to say the least. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Cuba#History|According to the Wikipedia]] the Soviet Union paid five times the world price for Cuban sugar. It&rsquo;s like saying that a mistress who is well supported by her rich sugar daddy is a success as a &ldquo;secretary&rdquo; though she can&rsquo;t type. As soon as the sugar daddy is gone, suddenly she&rsquo;s an incompetent secretary; and suddenly with it&rsquo;s sugar daddy gone, Cuba is a failed agriculture. I&rsquo;m sure both can find excuses, but they aren&rsquo;t credible.</p>
<p>For a world survey that identifies the necessary conditions for successful agricultural transformation, including in China, see [[http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item6436529/?site_locale=en_GB|Success in Agricultural Transformation]] forthcoming later in the summer from Cambridge University Press. The book squashes the usual claims about agriculture by both right and left, and puts forward an account consistent with historical and world-wide experiences. I&rsquo;ve had an early peak at the book because of being married to its author.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>How one stops Third World governments from being subservient to the &ldquo;rich and powerful minority&rdquo; in those countries is, of course the crucial question. Apart from a return to colonialism (hopefully enlightened this time), or a political transformation to stable democracy (which happens after, and as a result of, the emergence of a middle class&hellip; and if that middle class is not to be the very &ldquo;rich and powerful minority&rdquo; that prevents a sustained commitment to improving agriculture, that means the transformation would have to have already taken place&hellip;) it seems there is little that can be done.</p>
<p>Foreign aid is not done because we know it works well; we know it works poorly, but it helps a little and it&rsquo;s all we <em>can</em> do. None the less, I think the book of which your wife is a co-author will still provide helpful insights, though we may have so little chance to use them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, I referred to the successful implementation of intensive mechanised and chemical dependent agriculture in Cuba, i.e. to the extent of its implementation of the so-called green revolution, not to its economic success which, as you say, was heavily subsidised by the Soviet Union. But no measure can be made of the success or failure of Cuban agriculture or, indeed, any other aspect of their economy, independent of Cold War politics. Yes, the Soviets were paying well over the market price for Cuban sugar, but on the other hand the US market was closed to the sugar because of the embargo. Whatever the economic realities of the Cuban situation, my point was that they had massively implemented industrialised agriculture, and that entire system collapsed and had to be rapidly replaced during the ‘special period’ following the collapse of the Soviet Union because agriculture that is dependent on petroleum fueled machinery, imported chemical fertilisers, and export crops is intrinsically insecure and cannot be relied upon to feed the local population in times of crisis.</p>
<p>I live on an island. Food security is becoming an important issue here as rising fuel and ferry costs increase the costs of importing produce. Fifty years ago, the island was a net exporter of food to nearby cities, but the illusory ease of bringing food from elsewhere has created a situation which something like 85% of our food comes from elsewhere. Many islanders are now beginning to realise this offers poor food security. We live in a world in which some people are prevented from growing food to feed themselves because their local land is being used by transnational corporations to grow food for export, and other people are being discouraged from growing their own food in order to be a market for that food brought from elsewhere. This, in my opinion, is insane. Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;m going to go see if the potatoes need watering.</p>

How to make political change to better governments is, as Quadribloc notes, the biggest problem. Perhaps such a change is now happening in some Arab countries, but it is too early to say.</p>
<p>John, the failure of Cuban agriculture was not just a matter of cold war rivalry, but that the Soviets failed to understand agriculture, and had bad policies, starting with the idea of socialist agriculture itself, which has failed massively everywhere it has been tried.</p>
<p>The Soviets, my wife says, were under the delusion that mechanization is the whole solution to the problem of agriculture. Produce tractors and all is solved. This also didn&rsquo;t work in the Soviet Union. And poor countries other than Cuba successfully implemented and have sustained the Green revolution, unlike Cuba.</p>
<p>As for people being officially discouraged (I&rsquo;m not talking about market forces) from growing their own food in Canada, you&rsquo;ve got to be kidding. Enjoy the potatoes :)</p>

<p>And here I thought that the United States' activities in Afghanistan were all about ensuring the area does not become a staging area for al-Qaeda and its Taliban allies.</p>
<p>It certainly is true that trying to establish &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; in Afghanistan would be difficult, as apparently a majority of the men there are not willing to accept a truly democratic state with full equal rights for women and non-Muslims.</p>
<p>As for its mineral wealth - of course the country should be made so peaceful and quiet that multinationals can come in and mine. Would you rather that the people of Afghanistan starve to death? It&rsquo;s not as if the country can produce enough food to feed itself; nor does it have an educated population that could work in factories the way they do in South Korea, to earn money to import food.</p>
<p>What else is left? After all, it&rsquo;s not as if growing opium to export to the illegal drug trade can be tolerated as an option - allowing that to continue would be rightly and legitimately viewed as an act of war against the countries whose social systems are menaced by the drug trade.</p>

<p>The Afghanis, time and again since the First Anglo-Afghan War of 1839-1842, have made it <em>abundantly</em> clear that they do not want to have anything to do with the modern world, thank you very much, so all of your arguments about somehow bettering their lives are specious.</p>
<p>And what you <em>thought</em> about the cause of the United States' involvement in Afghanistan is precisely what the powers that be <em>want</em> you to think, just as they promulgate the myth that the American Civil War was fought to end the<em> moral</em> evils of chattel slavery (which it was not; it was fought to remove the impediments to Industrial expansion that the Plantation System presented); or that the Vietnam War was fought to &ldquo;liberate&rdquo; the Vietnamese people from leftist rebels (which it was not; the U.S. was asked to step in to continue the brutal oppression of the Vietnamese people instigated by the French in order to maintain access to the country&rsquo;s troves of &ldquo;glamor metals&rdquo;); or that, for many years, the United States supported right-wing autocrats in Central and South America to stanch the spread of Communism (which they did not; they weren&rsquo;t called &ldquo;banana republics&rdquo; for nothing).</p>
<p>Finally, &ldquo;the countries whose social systems are menaced by the drug trade&rdquo; are menaced because, in their moral rectitude, those countries choose to pursue a policy of prosecuting what are essentially victimless &ldquo;crimes,&rdquo; primarily at the behest of manufacturers of alcoholic beverages, despite the fact that the Centers for Disease Control estimates that about 75,000 Americans die each year from alcohol-related causes, and absolutely none&ndash;as far as they can determine&ndash;die from marijuana-related causes&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill: <em>As for people being officially discouraged (I&rsquo;m not talking about market forces) from growing their own food in Canada&hellip;</em></p>
<p>I <em>am</em> talking about market forces, which I do not understand as impersonal forces but as the results of specific policies of owners of capital, who not only exploit situations but create situations to be exploited. These policies create the circumstances in which it is massively easier and often cheaper, due to subsidies, for people to buy food rather than grow it. After a day&rsquo;s work, most people are too tired to put in the extra effort to grow their own food, and most have nowhere to grow it since they do not own land and the commons are virtually extinct. It is in the interest of the owners of capital for workers to spend most waking daylight hours, year round, working for wages; it is in their interest for workers to be paying rent rather than owning property; it is in their interest for workers to be buying all their food rather than growing it; it is in their interest for people to be dependent on commercial sources of everything they consume rather than becoming in various ways and to various degrees self-sufficient. So the owners of capital create these situations, so that they may exploit them to their interest. It is convenient to ascribe the creation of these situations to impersonal market forces rather than to the deliberate policies of individuals, just as it is convenient to pretend that a corporation is a person to shield individuals from responsibility for their decisions. I&rsquo;m not buying it.</p>
<p><em>And poor countries other than Cuba successfully implemented and have sustained the Green revolution, unlike Cuba.</em></p>
<p>Bill, again, what is specific to the Cuban special period, and what was central to the point I was making, was the sudden failure of their sources of fuel and agricultural chemicals. I was not arguing that the intensive agriculture of the Soviet-subsidised era was a success in some kind of neutral economic evaluation &ndash; but show me agriculture in a capitalist industrialised country that isn&rsquo;t subsidised &ndash;, and I only, inadvisedly, used the word &lsquo;successful&rsquo; to refer to the <em>extent of the implementation.</em> What I meant wasn&rsquo;t that it was all a splendid success but that it was indeed intensive, widespread, and constituted almost all of Cuba&rsquo;s agricultural activity during that period. But in order for the Cuban people to avoid starvation, the entire system had to be scrapped as soon as fuel and fertiliser sources failed, and I don&rsquo;t see any reason to think that the situation would be otherwise anywhere else that such sources failed, regardless of the relative success of the green revolution in other terms.</p>
<p>This is the point: the green revolution relies on technologies and resources that are not intrinsic to the growing of food, hence it links the security of food production to the security of the availability and affordability of those technologies and resources. And that makes for poor food security. In Cuba, the response to the crisis is well worth looking at, not least in that it required dismantling of centralised state control and the development of small-scale local food production and distribution; re-introduction of private ownership of farm land by farmers; development of widespread urban food production; and implementation, by necessity, of organic and permaculture growing methods. Interestingly, although the period of immediate crisis passed and, thanks to Chavez, they have a reliable source of fuel again, the Cubans show little interest in returning to large-scale industrialised agriculture. Indeed, Cuba has become a destination for people seeking to learn about successful urban permaculture.</p>

<p>Neither Austrialian nor New Zealand agriculture are subsidized, and are industrialized and successful. In Australia, the subsidies were gradually reduced from the &rsquo;70s until their complete removal in 2000. New Zealand went cold turkey in 1984, and it took ten years to adjust, but now they are thriving. Bruce Gardner, then assist. secty. of agriculture under Bush One helped write laws with a schedule for the removal of farm subsidies in the US. But congress reversed the schedules, and Bush Two went decisively against it. (Gardner was co-author of my wife&rsquo;s book, but he died suddenly, and she is now sole author; the book is dedicated to him.)</p>
<p>And individuals don&rsquo;t decide on subsidies. Governments do, and they are rarely individual decisions. The market place is the result of many decisions—of governments world wide, of producers and consumers.</p>
<p>Agriculture is a very complicated subject. One starting point, which you seem not to concede, is that socialist agriculture has never been successful anywhere, including Cuba.</p>
<p>And as Julia Child emphasized, organic permiculture cannot feed the world, so we need healthy scientific agriculture.</p>

<p>Are you reading what I am writing? I have not &lsquo;conceded&rsquo; that because I never claimed otherwise. I used the term successful only in terms of the <em>extent</em> of the industrialisation of Cuban agriculture in the Soviet-supported period, i.e. to the &lsquo;successful&rsquo; implementation of the policy of replacing of older agricultural modes, not the success of its outcome, which relied on an artificial economy and left the Cuban food supply vulnerable to rapid collapse. To clarify: I am not a fan of state socialist agricultural policy, any more than I am of their industrial or natural resource policies. [I do, however, have a lot of respect for self-collectivised and federated agriculture on the model of many Israeli kibbutz, the Ukraine during the brief Makhnovist period before the Bolshevik takeover (although in no way endorsing all of Makhno&rsquo;s actions), and the anarcho-syndicalist collectivisation in Catalonia and Aragon during the Spanish Revolution. The key difference between this and state socialist agriculture is that control is local: the people growing the crops are also managing the farms, and, in the best examples, the associations are voluntary and based on principles of subsidiarity.]</p>
<p>You have so far completely ignored the point I have now made twice regarding industrialised agriculture: it links food security to the security of fuel and chemical availability and affordability, not only in terms of cultivation and harvesting but also in terms of delivering produce to market (sometimes on the other side of the planet). In case you have not noticed, fuel prices are rising and hence food prices are rising. In response to rising petroleum prices, more and more agricultural land is being devoted to growing bio-fuels, further degrading food security.</p>
<p>With regard to &lsquo;healthy scientific agriculture&rsquo;, vs. &lsquo;organic permaculture&rsquo;: a) scientific does not always mean using chemical fertilisers, pesticides, etc., b) the best organic permaculture <em>is</em> scientific (in the sense of analytical, based on observation, measuring of yields, experiment), and c) there is an important place for small scale, local food production wherever it is possible, in terms of immediate food security, especially within cities*. It is not a question of being able to &lsquo;feed the world&rsquo; with such methods alone, but of feeding more parts of the world in better ways, with lower environmental impact and with better food security, while being alert to the fact that this puts one at odds with a lot of very rich and powerful people who profit from packing and moving produce around the world, even as mountains of food are allowed to rot to manage supply relative to demand in particular markets while people are going hungry.</p>
<p>We also seem to be having trouble with the &lsquo;healthy&rsquo; part of the healthy scientific agriculture equation, both in terms of physical and environmental health &ndash; unsurprisingly, spraying crops with poison ends up poisoning animals and humans; relying on biological monocultures instead of diversity creates vulnerabilities in our food supply &ndash; and in terms of economic health and human freedom. In the past few decades, chemical companies have mostly monopolised the international seed business. A typical model consists of obliging farmers to purchase genetically modified seeds in order to be able to grow plants that will not be killed by the same company&rsquo;s chemical pesticides, and then prohibiting farmers from saving any seeds from the plants they grow, obliging them to buy new seeds every year. I think it is morally indefensible to prevent farmers from saving seeds and that, indeed, this requirement fundamentally changes the nature of farming and seeks to turn farmers into corporately licensed crop managers rather than independent producers of food making choices about what and when to grow and how to grow it. I do not consider that &lsquo;healthy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>*It is an irony of urban development that cities, importing most of their food from  outside, are almost always situated in areas of prime agricultural land with excellent growing conditions. This is because when they were first founded local food sources were considered crucial to any city. This was explicit in both the classical and mediaeval periods (read St Thomas Aquinas on town planning and food security). As a result, despite the overlay of buildings and streets, many cities continue to provide excellent opportunities for local food production. In times of war, it is common for public parks and other urban gardens to be turned over to food production &ndash; in Canada they called them &lsquo;victory gardens&rsquo; &ndash; and I suppose the same thing will happen if fuel prices make it prohibitive to bring the current quantities of food from elsewhere.</p>

<p>industrialised agriculture &hellip;links food security to the security of fuel and chemical availability and affordability, not only in terms of cultivation and harvesting but also in terms of delivering produce to market</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry for my brevity. I&rsquo;m not ignoring, I just preoccupied with other stuff. I&rsquo;m glad you acknowledge the failure of state socialist agriculture. It wasn&rsquo;t clear to me, at least.</p>
<p>Yes, modern agriculture makes agriculture part of the whole industrial system. That is why it is much so more productive than pre-industrial agriculture.</p>
<p>When I visited Mali and the village where my daughter was in the Peace Corps, I saw traditional agriculture in its awful reality. I learned the meaning of &ldquo;dirt poor.&rdquo; Without powered machines or fuel, they produced barely enough to eat. And then to make breakfast the women had to draw water (hand over hand) from a well and pound grain. They took 1 1/2 hours of hard labor just to make breakfast.</p>
<p>In Chinese countryside, I saw an immensely more sophisticated and productive agriculture, but still based on intensive hand labor. That is way ahead of Mali, but still has back-breaking labor for a life of poverty. That&rsquo;s the life that millions are escaping from to the cities every year.</p>
<p>So when you talk about organic gardens, I&rsquo;m all for local food and personal growing as a supplement and enhancement. But to replace powered machinery, and chemical fertilizer and pesticides in agriculture, I think it&rsquo;s a romantic delusion. If you tried to feed and clothe yourself completely without using any fuel, commercial fertilizer or pesticides on your own land, you&rsquo;d have little time for designing fonts, and you&rsquo;d be much poorer. That would be a loss for both you and the world!</p>
<p>There are immense problems that have come with mechanized agriculture, but I don&rsquo;t think there is a good alternative to it. It has to be accepted as a necessity for a wealthy society, and made better.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, we&rsquo;re closer to agreeing. Much depends, of course, on where you are in the world. In some places, it is always going to be more difficult to produce reliable levels of local food given climate and soil conditions. On the other hand, I live in a place that has historically been outrageously bountiful, supporting complex native societies &ndash; of a kind more commonly associated with early agriculture &ndash; almost completely on the basis of hunting and gathering (although they did practise clam husbandry, which is is pretty cool).</p>
<p>Still I think you are overlooking the <em>vulnerability</em> of agriculture that is specifically linked to the availability and affordability of petroleum or other fossil fuels and chemical fertilizers and pesticides, in light of which local food and personal growing are not only supplements and enhancements but also the first line of defence against hunger in the event of disruptions to that availability and affordability.</p>
<p>When I was in high school, my best friend&rsquo;s father was an engineer specialising in human-powered agricultural machinery, much of it very simple but able to massively improve efficiency of traditional agriculture while not making people dependent on fossil fuels. Obviously E.F. Schumacher was a big influence. More recently, I came across the &lsquo;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/03/a-mad-scientists-50-tools-for-sustainable-communities/72900/">Global Village Construction Kit</a>': a modular system of relatively easy-to-build mechanical tools whose plans are open source. The goal is to provide modern comforts at a scale and cost which does not require disruption of traditional communities.</p>
<p>There is a tendency to try to globalise solutions to what are local particularities, and a tendency to treat solutions as either/or: you can&rsquo;t feed everyone everywhere with locally produced organic produce; ergo, agriculture everywhere should be mechanised and rely on chemical fertilizers. I know you can see the fallacy in that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@John Hudson:
<cite>After a day&rsquo;s work, most people are too tired to put in the extra effort to grow their own food, and most have nowhere to grow it since they do not own land and the commons are virtually extinct. It is in the interest of the owners of capital for workers to spend most waking daylight hours, year round, working for wages; it is in their interest for workers to be paying rent rather than owning property; it is in their interest for workers to be buying all their food rather than growing it; it is in their interest for people to be dependent on commercial sources of everything they consume rather than becoming in various ways and to various degrees self-sufficient.</cite></p>
<p>You are certainly describing the real situation most people find themselves in here. But I take issue with your description of the cause.</p>
<p>It would make things very simple if all of life&rsquo;s problems could be attributed to the machinations of a few evil villains, who could be brought to justice, and then the problems would be solved. But while some problems are the work of wicked men, other problems are more complicated.</p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t the United States in a situation where the commons is <em>not</em> extinct, and where most people do grow their own food and own their own homes instead of living in apartments? Simple arithmetic will give you the answer: because there are considerably more people in the United States than there were when this was true.</p>
<p>For the United States to have factories that build tractors and combines, so that agriculture there can be as productive as it needs to be to feed everyone, a specialized economy is needed. A significant fraction of that economy&rsquo;s productivity is spent on national defense - the tyrannies that make this expenditure necessary can be classed as evil villains who gratuitously make a bad situation worse.</p>
<p>Just as the development of agriculture did not lead to individuals leading better lives than they did as hunter-gatherers, but it made higher population densities possible, industrialization has allowed us to support more people - and the alternative to supporting more people is tolerating a high rate of infant mortality unless people make changes in their reproductive behavior of which we see no sign.</p>
<p>@John Hudson:
<cite>There is a tendency to try to globalise solutions to what are local particularities, and a tendency to treat solutions as either/or: you can&rsquo;t feed everyone everywhere with locally produced organic produce; ergo, agriculture everywhere should be mechanised and rely on chemical fertilizers. I know you can see the fallacy in that.</cite></p>
<p>Yes, it would be a fallacy to conclude that <em>all</em> agriculture should rely on chemical fertilizers. However, it would not be a fallacy to conclude that a large proportion of agriculture everywhere will not be concerned with &ldquo;locally produced organic produce&rdquo; if you can&rsquo;t feed everyone that way.</p>
<p>Therefore, if your goal is to feed everyone, and to keep on feeding everyone even if fossil fuel supplies cease to be available, while locally-produced organic food will help a few people to survive, they will not lead to the goal being met.</p>
<p>Thus, one has to look for something that actually is an answer to the problem.</p>
<p>And there is an answer. Fully utilizing available uranium resources, by using breeder reactors to turn U-238 into reactor fuel (Pu-239), as well as adding thorium resources to our fuel supplies (by breeding Th-232 to U-233, also fissionable) will give us plentiful energy supplies with which to continue an intensive industrial civilization for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Electricity can be used to produce chemical fertilizers from other raw materials, or to free up fossil fuels for their production. And given hundreds of years of breathing room, we will have time to develop long-term large-scale energy sources (space solar power, fusion power).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Quadibloc, I never said anything about ‘the machinations of a few evil villains’. I said that certain social arrangements and situations are in the class interest of the owners of capital. I don&rsquo;t agree that these arrangements and situations are ascribable to population size, and the enclosure of the commons is a process that began when populations were considerably smaller. The issue is not the size of the population but how that population is organised and occupied, which is predominantly in the interests of the owners of capital and against the interest of the mass of people who own neither capital nor property but have only their labour to sell. Obviously, it is also in the interest of the owners of capital to purchase that labour at the lowest price they can get. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to me controversial: Milton Friedman would tell you the same thing.</p>
<p>In 1795, John Thelwall was able to recall:</p>
<blockquote>Even in my short remembrance, bare-foot ragged children in that part of [Spitalfields, London] were very rare. I remember the time when a man who was a tolerable workman had generally, beside the apartment in which he carried on his vocation, a small summer house and a narrow slip of a garden, at the outskirts of the town, where he spent his Monday, either in flying his pidgeons or raising his tulips. But those gardens are now fallen into decay. The little summer-house and the Monday's recreation are no more; and you will find the poor weavers and their families crowded together in vile, filthy and unwholesome chambers, destitute of the most common comforts, and even the common necessaries of life.</blockquote>
<p>That was not a situation created by population growth, but by the interests of the proto-industrial capitalist class that found it commercially advantageous to destroy the piece-work economy, concentrate workers in factories, deny them their traditional day of recreation, and pay them barely enough to subsist on let alone to own property of their own. The system reached a kind of perfection in parts of the USA, for example in the coal mines of West Virginia where workers were paid in company scrip rather than US dollars, obliged to rent their homes from the company, and to purchase all their food and goods in the company store. This isn&rsquo;t the ‘machinations of a few evil villains’: it is the unopposed rational activity of the owners of capital in advancing their interests.</p>
