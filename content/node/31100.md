  body: Are you referring to users having the ability to move fonts around with their
    user accounts? Because that's something people have been doing on networked computer
    systems for decades. Right now I could stick my OS X user account on a network
    share and be free to use my fonts at every single machine capable out mounting
    said share. Plenty of Windows users do it in large enterprises. Any font designer
    who tries to fight networked home directories will be on the wrong side in a battle
    he's guaranteed to lose, because it's going to get his designs locked out of most
    Windows and Unix networks.

  body: "Nope, not LAN WAN stuff and I ain't talkin' about accessing your CPU remotely
    rather I think it's much closer to the direction Google is headed in terms of
    creating web based apps accessible via a browser or integrated into an OS and
    if part of that spec means the ability to access licensed fonts not part of the
    default app font set, that means there will need to be some technology in place
    to validate the font licensing.\r\n\r\nI don't think we'll see this sort of thing
    actually happen for 2-5 years but I do suspect we may be looking at an evolved
    application platform that will sync with a DRM system. Simon am I smokin' crack
    here or is this totally plausible?\r\n\r\nStuart :D"

  body: "Hi Stuart!\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't know exactly what this is referring
    to. But I could imagine that a user's 'setup' and files could be mirrored securely
    on-line in some way and a 'session' to that virtual machine could be established
    in much the same way as you might TS (terminal server) into your work computer
    from home. \r\n\r\nTraditionally when you TS into a machine I don't think there's
    any font specific licensing issues if the host machine is locked while the client
    machine accesses it. Where things become more tricky, with respect to licensing,
    is when you have multiple concurrent sessions connecting to the same machine -
    but that applies to apps, and other things as well as fonts.   "

  body: "<cite>So even if you drop by a [public] kiosk or somebody else's PC, we can
    bring down your home page, your files, your fonts, your favorites and those things.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt's
    this statement that really puzzles me the most because it's not the same type
    of TS into say a home or work desktop but the fact that files, apps, fonts, favorites
    can be accessed from anywhere and everywhere this ability is offered really challenges
    the idea of CPU based licensing if not turns it upside down.\r\n\r\nStuart :D"

  body: ">really challenges the idea of CPU based licensing if not turns it upside
    down.\r\n\r\nI think CPU licensing is already in trouble due to the prevalence
    of multi-proc computers, processors in printers and displays. I think most modern
    licenses talk about users - and apart from rare cases where you have two or three
    people working with a font at the same time (maybe one on the left side of the
    keyboard, one on the right and one on the mouse) I think it's pretty bulletproof. "
