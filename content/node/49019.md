  body: "This is an interesting specimen Ben. On first blush it looks hand written
    as a result of the tones in the ink. But after close scrutiny it is a typeface...
    I just do not know what it is. What a wonderful ruse. The scribbling and the blot
    are the coup!\r\n\r\nI am so sorry that I cannot help you. But there are certainly
    people on this site that will come to your rescue!\r\n\r\nThe fact that you thought
    it was a typeface is a tribute to you as I am a calligrapher and had to look twice.
    Yes it may have been obvious but I had to make sure!\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Thanks Michael. \r\n\r\nIndeed it has been artfully done \u2013 and it's
    my wife, not me, who deserves the credit for recognising it as a typeface rather
    than a piece of lettering. Really it's an object lesson for anyone wanting to
    make something look handwritten while using computer software to generate the
    artwork... let's hope someone can solve this riddle."

  body: "Thanks Stephen\r\n\r\nYour comment was very useful, because although it's
    not any of the 3IP Historical Pens, it got me thinking and I went to check out
    the script section at Veer; that led to thinking about P22's artist's collection,
    which has just coughed up their <a href=\"http://www.p22.com/products/vincent.html\">
    Vincent Regular.</a>\r\n\r\nSorry if this deprives anyone of their due share of
    fun..."
