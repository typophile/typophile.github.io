  body: Very close to Trade Gothic Bold, and in the same ballpark as Alternate Gothic
    and News Gothic, but in all cases the spur on the G is different.

  body: Akzidenz Grotesk is also close, but I still think the spur on the G is different.
    AG's M is different, too.

    to me. Make sure you're looking at the true apostrophe and not a straight prime
    mark.
