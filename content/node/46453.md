  body: Thanks for your suggestions. Maybe it's a custom made font. In the meantime
    I'll keep hunting.

    a project in mind?

  body: "Hi Stephen--\r\n\r\nBasically, I'm considering incorporating a font like
    the one in the Bonhams logo as part of a re-branding project where I work. However
    I'd need a heavier weight, and I was trying to find out if it might be part of
    a larger font family. "

  body: Cool. Any reason FF Dax wouldn't work for you? Also <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/noa_std_virtual/">Noa</a>
    and <a href="http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/VoiceSho/">Voice</a>.

  body: "Hi Stephen-- \r\n\r\nThanks for suggesting the fonts from Hubert Jocham.
    There are some really nice ones there. The font \"Voice\" is probably the closest
    to what I had in mind. You have been a great help. Thanks again!\r\n\r\n--Kevo"
