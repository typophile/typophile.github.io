  body: I do like the simplicity. But the small nav text is nearly unreadable on my
    end. And the type becoming <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/post/about/the_heap/">unreadable
    over time</a> is an interesting concept, but not very practical.

      conceptually brilliant. Then again, I reckon he isn''t leaning towards the practical
      approach at the moment.'

  body: I think it's a little dull and the font size is way too big - who has the
    patience to scroll down like that. I'm not getting the concept - visually - of
    the type getting lighter over time either. I'd click on this once and not go back.

  body: "<cite>Helvetica Neue (or Arial Eue on typographically challenged OSes).</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    like that. Even though it's based on a mispronunciation."

  body: i guess aesthetically if i just went to the site randomely I would not like
    it. But I love the fact that he is willing to throw out new ideas and explore
    beyond the normal.

  body: "I've gone back and read, not scanned, the new site with the two readme pages
    dedicated to the new design. While I still think the contrast is too low and it
    does making reading not-so-fun (for me anyway), the concept is mind-blowing and
    very, very cool. \r\n\r\nI actually do like the size of the type as I'm sick-to-death
    of type so small it hurts to focus. (ergo: I'm loving the trend for large type.)
    Until the WC3 can find a way to embed fonts without violating the EULA, I won't
    complain about Helvetica or Arial or Georgia or (insert), because they could be
    using something worse. His attention to line-length and line-spacing is good,
    I think. Scrolling comes with the territory. I'd rather scroll than click to get
    the next page.\r\n\r\nHe mentions that he's still working on the alogrithms for
    the color, so I hope the contrast is increased (at least a little more)."
