  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I understand that what I have to say might not be news. But it's a fresh pain in my heart, and I feel I have to talk about it.

I was in the grocery store the other day, getting stuff to make an extensive breakfast spread for a group of friends. As I passed looked through the refrigerated section looking for some orange juice, my eye (that of a keenly college student) was immediately drawn to what I first thought was a generic brand OJ. Plain white box, picture of orange juice in a plain stemmed glass, little emphasis on the brand name, unremarkable. I assumed it was going to be a cheap knockoff. Then I saw the price, checked the label, and realized that Tropicana had betrayed my trust.

It has come to my attention that that's how they package things in England. I've heard people say it's simple, nostalgic and streamlined. I think it's tragic. Sideways logo? Really? Absolute white space that just looks cheap? The leaves by the cap is cute, I like that, but now when I want to see an orange with a straw in it, I have to do it myself. And drinking an orange is not as easy as the former packaging implied. It makes me very sad. They've traded in an iconic image for a bland (no matter how tasteful and pretty the box is, it's ultimately something anyone could do and nothing exceptional) design.

Alas.

It makes me almost as sad as seeing Lucida Handwriting on big, expensive signs.

PepsiCo has already announced that they are going to do away with the new packaging:
