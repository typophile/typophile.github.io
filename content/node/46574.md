  I am running Mac OS X 10.4.\r\n\r\nSECOND! I use Font Book to look at my fonts.\r\n\r\nNEXT,
  the moment you've been waiting for...... - - - -{ MY QUESTION }- - - -... How do
  I access the characters of special fonts and know which keys they correspond to?
  \ For example, a font which has no letters can be difficult to use without knowing
  which character goes with which key, and FURTHERMORE! some fonts don't seem to correspond
  with any of the keys.  Even though they show characters in Font Book, everything
  comes up as an X (or something similar) when keys are pressed DOWN.  \r\n\r\nTHANK
  YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nthank you vetty much."
