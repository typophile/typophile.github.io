  body: "Chris is quite right as concenrs a Greek final sigma being the shape of a
    standard uppercase Sigma when setting text in small caps. \r\n\r\nAs concerns
    diacritics, this is where it's easy (or perhaps complex, depending on your viewpoint
    and the coding you'll use for Open Type subs*). The rule to remember is: Greek
    text set in all caps and/or small caps (and yes petite caps, too, if anyone's
    curious) uses practically no diacritics. The sole ones you'll need to retain are
    for the vowels with dialytika (diaeresis). \r\n\r\nEasy enough? Good. That's the
    way to go if one wants to \"play by the rules.\" And please note this does not
    change dependent on whether the Greek text being set is in Katharevousa (Purist),
    Archaic, Koine (think New Testament era Greek), or contemporary Demotiki. \r\n\r\nBest
    regards,\r\nR.C.C.\r\n\r\n* (Imagine coding all those accented polytonic \"alpha
    with [whatever]\" characters to sub to a single small cap Alpha. Have fun.)\r\n\r\n"

    (U+03C2) capitalize to \u03A3 (U+03A3).\r\n\r\n> <em>and for the lowercase diacritic
    characters, what should be done?</em>\r\n\r\nThe short answer is, accents are
    dropped except the dialytika, as R.C.C. said. This means, in AllCaps/SmallCaps
    only context, lowercase capitalizes like this:\r\n\r\n\u03AC --> \u0391\r\n\u03AD
    --> \u0395\r\n\u03AE --> \u0397\r\n\u03AF --> \u0399\r\n\u03CC --> \u039F\r\n\u03CD
    --> \u03A5\r\n\u03CE --> \u03A9\r\n\r\n\u03CA --> \u03AA\r\n\u03CB --> \u03AB\r\n\u0390
    --> \u03AA\r\n\u03B0 --> \u03AB\r\n\r\nand this is only monotonic..."
