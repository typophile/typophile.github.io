  body: "@kotg: Welcome to Typophile! A quick tip to help you out: \r\n\r\nIn the
    future, try to use informative hyperlink language other than ambiguous words such
    as \u201Cthis\u201D or \u201Chere.\u2019\u2019 They gives the user no idea where
    they are about to go . Instead, try \u201C<em>I\u2019m looking for a sans serif
    used on <a href=\"http://blog.davor.se/\">this website about visual programming</a></em>.\u201D
    That makes it easier for the user, and you will get more responses.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck, and may the fonts be with you\u2026 \r\n\r\n(booo)\r\n"
