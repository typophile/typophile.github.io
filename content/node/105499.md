  body: "Here is the story of the typeface. The basic form is a Latin, i.e. triangular
    serifs.\r\n\r\nAccording to Gray's _Nineteenth Century Ornamented Types_\r\nThe
    basic alphabet seems to have been designed by Caslon in 1864; it is a triangular
    serifed letter with broken cross-bar to A and H, serifed apex to A, conspicuously
    canted serifs to T and E, a splayed M and N with a bottom serif to the diagonal
    which presages the drooping tails which are the characteristic of developed Monastic.
    This original design (called Old Face no. 2) does not seem to have had much success,
    but as developed into Monastic, which was first shown by Caslon (as Venetian)
    in the same year it became enormously popular. It represents the least creative,
    the pseudo-antiquarian and arty side of Victorian letter design. There was no
    lower case, but larger, more ornamented initials were provided to be combined
    with the upper case\u2014possibly indeed with an upper case of quite different
    design\u2014the idea of decorated initials was coming in. Tails were also added
    to other faces, Latins, Runics, Tuscans.\r\n\r\n----\r\nIn the U.S. Monastic is
    shown in the Boston Type Foundry specimen book of 1865.\r\nIt was soon sold by
    most major foundries and was popular until the end of the 19th century.\r\n\r\nMonastic
    is the usual name but it was also sometimes sold as Ancient or Venetian.\r\n\r\nDon "

    just been glancing at another publication from the same printer, same year and
    the same font.\r\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t expecting a digitised version to exist."
