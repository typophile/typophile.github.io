body: "This looked to me initially to be Letter Gothic, but I couldn't get the version
  of Letter Gothic Std I have to produce exactly the right \"density\". And the capital
  'A' is wrong.\r\n\r\nI ran this through WhatTheFont, which suggested [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/letter-gothic/12-pitch-bold/|Letter
  Gothic 12 Pitch Bold]] or ParaType [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/new-letter-gothic/pt-new-letter-gothic-bold/|PT
  New Letter Gothic Bold]]. However, the capital 'J' doesn't match. There are other
  fonts that come close, but typically the number '1' or capital 'I' or 'M' is wrong.\r\n\r\nI
  did some hunting online and skimmed through my Linotype catalogue, but couldn't
  find anything there, either.\r\n\r\nIs this a custom version of Letter Gothic, or
  another font?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[As an aside: The font on most Air Canada boarding
  passes is different from this one. This was printed in a US checkin terminal (BNA)
  from a laptop(!) instead of via the usual AC kiosk or checkin counter terminal.
  I think Arial or Helvetica is the \"usual\" font\u2026]"
