    guessing that means for your business? Do you have to pay if you want to use Font

  body: Nice, but undone. The fonts don't share the same gylph sets. So made some

    fonts/faces is sell''em as a separate product. Designing stuff with''em, be it
    for yourself or others, commercial or not, qualifies as <em>use</em>.'
