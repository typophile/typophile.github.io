body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am looking for help on identifying the font in the attached PNG.\r\n\r\nThe
  shame is, it is actually my own print (from 2008), and I lost the font in a PC crash...
  and I cant remember where i got it from !\r\n\r\nI thought i would find it easily,
  but no success in the various identification web services.\r\n\r\nThe font is a
  semi pixelated / dotted font, like a classic font (times new roman style) going
  digital by some bits.\r\n\r\nMakes me think a bit of the X in the old XEROX logo.\r\n\r\nAny
  help very welcome\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nAurelien"
