  body: 'It''s a poster from the book "Cuba Style: Graphics from the Golden Age of
    Design." Didn''t know if someone out there had digitized this typeface, or if
    there''s even anything similar. I looked on Letterhead fonts, thinking this would
    be my most likely source, but to no avail. '

    href="http://www.dafont.com/gyptienne.font?text=CUBA" target="_blank">Gyptienne</a>,
    and a mix of characters from the regular and alternate fonts of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/quaint-gothic-sg/"
