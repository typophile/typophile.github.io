    the best choice, taking this sample as a model, if you ask me. But, yes, I know
    how customers are. '

  body: "If you or your client are picky, Rhode is not nearly as close as Arial Black
    extended to about 145%. (Look at the counterspace in the D, and the proportion
    of the vertical to the horizontal in the L.)\r\n\r\nTo get it even closer, chop
    off the middle arm of the \"E\" a little."
