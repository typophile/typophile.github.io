body: "Hi All, (from a first time poster)\r\n\r\nWould any of you distinguished readers
  here have a considered opinion to offer on the following two scenarios regarding
  use of modern digital fonts for hot metal type.  \r\n\r\n1: A Ludlow LineCaster
  makes use of loose matrixes to make up lines of type that are commercially used
  in hot-foil stamping and in some other applications.  The font matrixes are rather
  complex to prepare and one needs enough letters to set a whole line of type. Each
  font matrix would be used with just one Ludlow for generating text line slugs for
  use on multiple presses.  Many matrix sets could be machined.\r\n\r\n2: A Monotype
  SuperCaster makes use of loose matrixes to cast loose type that can be set into
  copy or collected into a complete font for hand set letterpress. These matrixes
  are less complex to machine and only one of each character is required.  The set
  type would be used to print at one location but multiple complete fonts could be
  cast and used in multiple locations.  Again multiple matrix sets could be machined.\r\n\r\nOther
  than free fonts what sort of license might cover the intended use where the cast
  lines, fonts of type or casting matrixes are distributed?\r\n\r\nRegards"

    oldnick made. Also, would the distribution of the\r\nmetal types involve selling
    them for profit?\r\n\r\nI'd seek a special arrangement with the foundries whose
    designs you\r\nwish to reproduce. I'd bet that most independents would be thrilled
    to\r\nsee their work adapted to metal.\r\n\r\nEverything new is old again. :^)\r\n\r\nDelve\r\n"

  body: "There is one very important point you need to clarify before you can expect
    and informed answer, and that is: How will the matrices be machined? If you use
    the font outlines (the \"computer program\" part of a font, which is copyrightable)
    to generate CNC or similar code to drive a mill, you will be running afoul of
    the prohibition against adapting, translating, reverse engineering, decompiling,
    disassembling or creating derivative works provisions in most standard End-User
    Licensing Agreements, and you will need to negotiate a special agreement to accommodate
    such use.\r\n\r\nAnd please do not assume that any font which is free to <em>use</em>
    is therefore free to adapt/translate/etc.: the code is still protected, and a
    special agreement for its use is also in order."

  body: "Hi oldnic, delve,\r\n\r\nWell the idea would be to use CNC machining and
    some derivative of the digital font description to generate the shapes (faithfully
    with minimum effort and errors).  I see how limitations on derivative works would
    restrict use of the copyrighted outlines in general. Would scanned copies of printed
    output (or pixel based renderings) be a way to avoid the copyright in all/most
    cases (requiring a name change if not sanctioned)?\r\n\r\nThe hope would be to
    use the mats to cast lines of type on the Ludlow or fonts of type on the SuperCaster
    for money, for the use of those people who need and/or like letterpress but desire
    some modern fonts.  I agree that the independent digital font foundries would
    be more likely to entertain the concept even though the intended use is not real
    competition to anyone and might occasionally result in a marketing coup.\r\n\r\nI
    realise now that I should have asked my question thus:  <strong>What standard
    (free or for a fee) digital font license models cover (optionally marketable)
    analogue copies of the font?</strong>\r\n\r\nThe answer may turn out to be none.\r\n\r\nRegards"

  body: I'd hazard a guess the answer is indeed none, specifically. This is an uncommon
    situation. Perhaps talk to those foundries whose designs are in question, just
    to see if they'd be willing to grant a special license covering your usage. You're
    on the right track thinking of the marketing partner(s) potential there. Good
    Luck!

  body: "Kalle,\r\n\r\nI would look at it from a different angle: Invite type foundries
    to have their designs produced in metal. I think some would be very interested,
    and you could simply negotiate an arrangement for them to receive some royalties
    or payment for fonts sold. Then the entire operation is legitimate. Not sure how
    large the market will be for the fonts, though. \r\n\r\nPersonally I've been thinking
    about how to get new type designs produced in metal, but for some reason I want
    to take the difficult path and cut my own punches. \r\n\r\nGood luck, and keep
    us posted!"

    you are proposing as offering the font design in another format, so just as a
    TrueType to Opentype conversion would require licensing to market, so would a
    digital to analogue. Whether it is Ludow Mats or rubber stamps, even if the original
    bezier points are gone, the design remains a derivative product in a new format
    that owes its entire existence to that design. Licensing or foundry agreement
    would be a prudent first step.\r\n\r\nI know of at least one foundry already working
    on a metal/digital release.\r\n;^)"

    and growing percentage of the letterpress community already use digital type for
    printing, and less and less use metal type. Your conversion costs are prohibitive
    and the potential market is nil (if not, the metal type foundries would not have
