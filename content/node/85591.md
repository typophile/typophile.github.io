  my new font (.otf) comes out really strange. It seems as if all characters on one

  I did wrong in FL? Or has it to do with InDesign? I use XPress and haven't seen

  body: "Oh, I'm curious if anyone knows more. I've had this happen too, with commercially
    available fonts, in CS4 (only the squooshed justified line, where the red arrow
    is, though; not the other blobs); I've been able to fix it locally by changing
    the hyphenation somewhere before or after the line in question. But I wonder why
    it happens \u2013 I've been thinking it's probably InDesign getting confused about
    H&Js (I've only had it happen in longer documents / books)."

  body: Occasionally an odd problem can be due to a corrupt text box or a corrupt
    document. Make a brand new text box (not a copy of the existing one) and see if
    that helps. If it doesn't, try creating a brand new document and see if the problem
    still occurs.

    thing occur if I limit the number of hyphens in a row too severely. A line that
    obviously begs for hyphenation doesn\u2019t have any \u2014 <em>and</em> I can\u2019t
    seem to force it to \u2014 until I realize that it has reached its limit and that\u2019s
    why it\u2019s squooshing or spacing in an extreme fashion.\r\n\r\nAnother example
    of why it\u2019s not necessarily good to tie the hands of InD\u2019s H&J engine
    too tightly.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the
    OP\u2019s example. And it might not be what\u2019s going on in your case.\r\n\r\nBut
    I thought I\u2019d mention it, since it\u2019s easy to overlook.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks all.\r\nI had a feeling it had something to do with the ligatures.
    When the ligatures are turned off in INDD, the problem is solved. \r\n\r\nNevertheless,
    could it be there's some bad coding in the .otf? I did design some ligatures and
    stylistic alternates, but removed them in a later stage. Could it be that the
    code for these is still in the .otf file and corrupting it?"

    is.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the issue could be related to a feature gone awry, especially
    if turning off a feature solves the problem. But I think we\u2019d need to see
    what characters are in those lines that got collapsed in order to troubleshoot
    along those lines.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would helpful to see what H&J setting you\u2019re
    using on that setting.\r\n"
