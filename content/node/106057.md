  body: "STATE: should be [[http://www.dafont.com/usa.font|USA]] by Iconian Fonts,
    may be scaled\r\nGRANITE: thought I could find a match but came to nothing perfect.
    Still pretty convinced it's a techy freebie or a cutomization based on (various?)
    techy freebie. Try having a look to these 2 sections at DaFont, may be you'll
    be luckier than me: [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno > Sci-fi]],
    [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Techno > Various]] ([[http://www.dafont.com/tr909.font|TR-909]],
    [[http://www.dafont.com/terminator.font|Terminator]], [[http://www.dafont.com/boom-box.font|Boom
    Box]]...)\r\nPosting reworked sample too, could be helpful for some other identifiers...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_5090.png]\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    finally, got it! That was [[http://www.dafont.com/boom-box.font|Boom Box]] but
    [[http://www.dafont.com/boom-box.font?text=granite|full lowercase]] and not uppercase..."
