  with the rectangle tool then another rectangle (or any shape) on top of that, shouldn't
  both the shapes merge together. I'm sure that's the way FL worked but not now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I don't think it's supposed to that automatically. You can merge it manually,
    though.

  body: Only if you select the colour of the rectangle as black, and likewise if if
    it is white then it will subtract.

  body: "I checked on an old machine with FL installed and overlapping outlines merged
    as I expected when I added another shape to the window. Is there a preference
    or something that would stop this behaviour \r\n\r\nThis first image shows a simple
    glyph made from two outlines.   \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-1_4977.gif]\r\n\r\nIf
    I add an outline to the same window with the rectangle tool the two outlines are
    merged. I like working this way because it's a quick way to merge outlines while
    I can keep a copy of the un-merged outlines in the mask layer.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture-2_5619.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nJH,
    I haven't lived in Bristol for a while now, I should update my profile. I didn't
    know Laurence when I was there or any other Typophilers, I don't know any other
    Typophilers. I love Tyophile but it's not exactly facebook."

    the Merge Contours button or press ctrl/cmd + F10 instead? ;)

    in exactly the right place the first time? Merging contours should be a choice
    during the design phase in my opinion. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "It's a (slightly bizarre) feature, not a bug.\r\n\r\nWhen you draw using
    the primitives tools (rectangle and oval), or using the paint brush, there is
    a \"paint mode\" that affects what happens when you draw. It doesn't affect the
    line and curve drawing tools, but it will affect the paths you have already created
    with them as soon as you use one of the \"paint\" tools (the rectangle, oval,
    or brush tools). Here is the paint mode selector on the paint toolbar:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/paintmode_4611.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    modes, from left to right, are:\r\n\r\nEmpty color\r\nAuto color\r\nBlack color\r\nWhite
    color\r\n\r\nThese modes affect what happens when you create overlapping shapes
    with any of the \"paint\" tools. Unfortunately, they also affect any existing
    overlapping shapes that you have drawn with other tools as soon as you use one
    of the \"paint\" tools. \r\n\r\nTo prevent this automatic merging from happening,
    be sure that the \"Empty color\" mode is selected. The behavior you're seeing
    is because one of the other three modes is selected."
