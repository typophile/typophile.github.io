body: "I'm laying out a poster and in terms of a condensed font, Bitstream Aurora
  Bold Condensed really has the size and weight I'm looking for.  It just doesn't
  have the right \"feel\" somehow though as a typeface.  \r\n\r\nAs kind of a shot
  in the dark, I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions of any other typefaces
  of similar size and weight I might look into.  Am sort of wide-open in terms of
  going with something classic or modern at this point--the poster could go in either
  direction.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to this font:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aurora/bold-condensed/"

    and size... Akzidenz Grotesk Bold Condensed and Railroad Gothic come to mind.
