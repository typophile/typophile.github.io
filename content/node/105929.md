  in type design, but lack the skill to carry it through.\r\n\r\nI've designed the
  outlines of a typeface, and I'm seeking a talented designer to turn it into a beautiful
  book face.\r\n\r\nYou are probably unfamiliar with the lettershapes. They are not
  English. I'll be happy to send more details upon application.\r\n\r\nI think, more
  than anything else, for the English typographer, this will be an exercise very much
  like this: http://typophile.com/courses/type110\r\n\r\nThat is, you will be given
  a set of shapes that you are probably unfamiliar with, and be asked to sculpt them
  into a match for a classic typeface. If you can pass Jonathan Hoefler's \"test\"
  with flying colours, then this job may be for you.\r\n\r\nRequirements: An experienced,
  talented type designer with a proven record of producing a beautiful, elegant, classic
  book face. Please provide a sample of at least one such typeface you have designed.\r\n\r\nIf
  you think you are interested, for more details please email me at admin (at) freelancebookdesign.com.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAriel\r\n\r\nPS
  I have never commissioned a font before, and am unfamiliar with the price-range
  for such a job. I am aware that this is a big roject and I want it done excellently.
  It may be out of my range, so apologies in advance if it turns out that I've wasted
  your time."
