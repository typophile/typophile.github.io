  body: It might be something the NYT magazine commissioned for this issue -- i.e.,
    it might not be for sale anywhere.

  body: "I was in New York this weekend and saw the issue. It struck me that the lettering
    succeeded in capturing the idiosyncrasies of those individual lives lived within
    a common framework, which was the typeface itself combined with our shared understanding
    of it (e.g. reading). Very moving work.\r\n\r\nInteresting to compare it to Shepard
    Fairey's graphically intensive [[http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20081229,00.html
    | cover of Obama]] for [[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2008/personoftheyear/article/0,31682,1861543_1865068_1867014,00.html
    | Time's Person of the Year]], for example. Both aim to capture the spirit of
    and urgency of individuals but they do so in very different ways."
