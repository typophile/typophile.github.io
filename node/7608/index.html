		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m reviving this thread because it&rsquo;s three years and two upgrades later&hellip; but I can&rsquo;t seem to find a way to change the kerning tables permanently for a font in InDesign. It&rsquo;s quite easy in Quark but none of the help topics or the InDesign book I own seem to explain how to do this in InD. I&rsquo;m using Perpetua and for some reason the italics are kerned way too tight around quote marks. I&rsquo;d like to adjust this globally for the font rather than on a case by case basis. Does InDesign allow you to do this? If so, how?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Miguel - I don&rsquo;t agree that we should be constrained by the font &ldquo;as is&rdquo; or be forced to kern each pair manually. Even some beautiful fonts have kerning problems. When I have &ldquo;metric&rdquo; kerning turned on in InD, I can see the kerning pairs but can&rsquo;t change them globally. I would think that an application created to help designers and typesetters do their job as best they can wouldn&rsquo;t just dismiss a tool that was so useful in Quark.</p>
<p>Nobody is asking the application to fix the fonts, but typesetting is an exacting discipline (if it&rsquo;s to be done well) and why not provide a valuable tool to help the designers do that? It would only improve the software. I&rsquo;m actually considering starting this job over again in Quark in order to finesse the kerning.</p>

<p>Just because a font can have a lot of kerning pairs does not mean that they will be applied well, nor does it mean that the pairs will be appropriate for all, or even most, situations.</p>
<p><cite>If the font is lacking an obvious kern pair, or is kerned too tight, you can almost certainly call it a bug.</cite></p>
<p>Call it a bug to whom? The font designers? The myriad of fonts with crap kerning pairs for numbers shows just how many font designers don’t really pay too much attention to the users on this issue.</p>
<p><cite>And the job of layout applications is to provide the fonts “as is”; layout applications are not the right tools to fix fonts.</cite></p>
<p>Now you are just being absurd. Typesetting needs change dramatically for a number of reasons and layout software should offer users the flexibility to cope with those changes. Kerning is not fixing a font, it is a method of adapting spacing to a situation. Being able to do this globally would be a boon to Indesign users—especially Indesign users who have purchased font licenses that do not allow modifications.</p>

<p>Then (pardon my vent), every font Adobe has issued is buggy. Try setting &ldquo;quotedblleft&rdquo; plus &ldquo;quoteleft&rdquo; &ndash; and of course, &ldquo;quoteright&rdquo; &ldquo;quotedblright&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Or footnote calls (superiors) following a quote(dbl)right &ndash; or following a period &ndash; or comma &ndash; or an f or g or or r, t, v, w (sometimes x) or y &ndash; etc. How about fractions, particularly the one.numr sort &ndash; following any number? The reason for having arbitrary fractions is so if/when you have to set 11/32, you can. That stops any strategy of using an unnaturally large left sidebearing on the numerator to get the needed space.</p>
<p>Etc. In any event, a bunch of kern pairs are omitted; others are too loose or too tight bye my eye.</p>
<p>I sort of agree though, that kerning should be in the font. The user should be able to fix the kerning, IN THE FONT. To it&rsquo;s credit, Adobe&rsquo;s EULA permits this. But man, is it hard taking apart the kerning of an OT font &amp; re-doing it. It can be so frustrating that I often go back to our Type 1 fonts &amp; make OT versions of them. Today was spent on Adobe Caslon (Type 1 to OT). Of course I have Adobe&rsquo;s Adobe Caslon Pro &ndash; it came with some software &ndash; but for good kerning &amp; character naming, it is easier to start over, even if I miss kerning Tcommaaccent with everything else. I, anyway, set a lot fewer Tcommaaccents than I do footnote calls, fractions, and quotes within quotes.</p>

<p>I have kerned fonts, and I certainly tried to cover all the pairs that I could think of, and which made sense, so I know that it&rsquo;s impossible to predict all the situations where and how the fonts will be used.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kerning is not fixing a font, it is a method of adapting spacing to a situation.</em></p>

<p>Right, and a good font should have kerning for 97% of those situations. The other 3% can be done manually, I think.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Try setting “quotedblleft” plus “quoteleft” — and of course, “quoteright” “quotedblright”.</em></p>

<p>What kind of kerning do those need?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>others are too loose or too tight bye my eye.</em></p>

<p>I hear you; we all have different perceptions of how much close/far glyphs should be from each other, but for the most part what&rsquo;s in the font ought to work for most people, no?</p>

<p>No offense but this is patently absurd. Then why not go for monospace? I would think font designers would want to create the best possible appearance for their font. But kerning is subjective, and just like there is good design and&hellip; not so good design, the same holds true for kerning tables. I&rsquo;m not asking InDesign to make these decisions for me (altho it seems to want to) but to provide me with the tool I NEED to make these decisions for myself.</p>
<p><cite>or the most part what’s in the font ought to work for most people, no?</cite></p>
<p>and comic sans works for a lot of people too. Does that make it good? Are you trying to appeal to designers or the lowest common denominator?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great application, but this is a glaring omission. Your attitude, again no offense, seems pretty shortsighted. You really need to wait for &ldquo;thousands of users&rdquo; before you add a feature? If you&rsquo;re gonna ignore the needs of designers who care about kerning then I&rsquo;m gonna stick with Quark.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A few thoughts on this:</p>
<p>Spacing/kerning should be as perfect as possible in a font. However, there are limits to this requirement:
First, spacing/kerning always expresses the &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo; of the type designer, while the typographer&rsquo;s spacing/kerning &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo; may be quite different.
Second, it is impossible to care for <cite>all</cite> possible glyph combinations. The larger fonts get, the harder this is to achieve. (In old 256 glyph fonts, it was a possible maximum of ca 65000 pairs to kern, or check at least; in recent 1000-2000 glyph fonts, this is 1-4 mio. pairs to kern, or check.)
With every font I kern I wonder <cite>what</cite> to kern. I mean: beyond the usual stuff. Letters with numerals? &lsquo;T4&rsquo; or &lsquo;A4&rsquo; can both be pretty ugly combinations. Quotation marks with all kinds of math symbols or miscellaneous glyphs? One may refer to them in a text and surround them by quotes &hellip;
E.g. in some fonts I noticed kerning pairs for .’ and ,’ (in English), but not for ’. and ’, (in German). Or fonts that only kern uppercase with following punctuation marks, but not the other way round &ndash; which may occur in email addresses. Not very useful, from a typographer&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>Since there is the Cool Kerning tool (at a reasonable price), need to implement this functionality into InDesign is not <cite>that</cite> pressing.</p>
<p>However, I think it <cite>could</cite> be a useful addition to InDesign.
Alongside the current kerning box (for kerning a particular glyph combination at a particular place) and the tracking box, I can imagine another kerning box for kerning of a particular glyph combination <cite>whereever it appears throughout a the document</cite>. Yet it&rsquo;s not that easy, because: does the value apply to this particular font only (i.e. style)? or to this font family? or to all fonts in a document? Moreover: only in this document or in others too?
I just watched the Cool Kerning demo. Its approach to create font groups illustrates that the issue is more complex than just additional box &ndash; it requires some more options.
[Edit:
Now I think these user-defined kerning pairs are additions/corrections to the <cite>font</cite>, not to a single document alone. Since CS is a suite, the kerning pairs saved in one app could be available in the others too.
So, when entering a kerning pair in this additional box, this would be added to a special preference file read by all CS apps.]</p>
<p>As Mr Ellertson says, modifying metrics in OTFs is really tricky and may even break other feature functionality in fonts (FLS does not import <cite>all kinds</cite> of features when opening an OTF/TTF).
So an option to do this in the layout application maybe is not the worst scenario.</p>

<p>Also sorry if my tone was harsh but Miguel it felt to me like you were just dismissive of my suggestion as not gonna happen without really considering what value it is to designers to be able to control kerning. The choice between &ldquo;no kern at all&rdquo; or just using the fonts &ldquo;as is&rdquo; (both of which you suggested) is not much of a choice, is it?</p>
<p>I am relatively new to InD and was kind of stunned not to find this feature. As a result, when I have a choice, I think I&rsquo;m more likely to continue using Quark. Most publishers in NY still use Quark and this may be part of the reason.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I understand the value of such feature, specially for book designers. But consider this: When InDesign came along, Quark already had this feature for years; nonetheless, InDesign is already in version 5, and there&rsquo;s no sight of such feature (I have a vague idea that version 1.0 had it, but I may be wrong). The people in charge of InDesign are bright, committed, and surely listen to the users' needs. We all know that InDesign and Quark are running for the same piece of the cake, so, don&rsquo;t you think that if that feature was <em>that</em> important, it would had already been added?
Again, I see the value of being able to edit the kerning, but that feature may not be added in the near future, unless a lot of users demand for it, I think.</div>

<p>Many of you are type designers rather than &ldquo;applications&rdquo; designers. Would it shock you to know that as a user, I find OpenType sadly lacking? It lacks a feature I think very important to the user, namely, the ability to (fairly easily) modify it for a user&rsquo;s individual needs. Whatever arguments you want to advance as to why this is incorrect are also available to the &ldquo;applications&rdquo; designers about their one-size-fits-all products.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Will, it can be a problem. The way Quark worked was to read in those kern pairs already in the font, then let the user add to them &ndash; or remove them, if that was your preference.</p>
<p>The way we worked, on a PC with TeX, (where TeX made use of the AFM to make up a TFM for metrics), was simply to edit the AFM itself. Nothing was perfect, if you used Fontographer for your kerning, and if you had characters (as they were called in those days) above character number 256, Fontographer would mess up the character names in the kerning &ndash; so you had to learn work-arounds.</p>
<p>But OpenType is different, with its class-based kerning, which I imagine is tables within tables. And just when kerning is applied could also get in the way &ndash; if you are substituting glyphs with other features, kerning obviously has to wait until all such substitutions have been made. Since I&rsquo;m not a programmer, this seems like a tougher nut to crack than the simple Quark approach to Type 1 fonts. I would also worry that Adobe might farm the programming of this one out, as it appears the exception dictionary was farmed out, with similar results.</p>
<p>The more I work with OpenType, the more I&rsquo;m against class-based kerning, on the grounds that creates more problems than it solves.</p>

I mean, I&rsquo;m all in favor of giving more power to the users (see <a href="http://typophile.com/node/32683">Who wants/needs a Glyph Palette in Photoshop?</a>, for example), but it&rsquo;s the first time I hear so many voices complaining about the lack of such feature.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I truly wish that this thread helps you all get what you want. I&rsquo;m a big fan of InDesign, and if it turns out that this feature has been on your wishlist for a long long time and hasn&rsquo;t been added yet, then speak up; our combined forces will hopefully make their way to the right people. (But again, what blows my mind is that from 2004, when this thread was started, until now, I don&rsquo;t recall anyone raising this issue. Therefore, thanks to Patricia for resurrecting this discussion.)</p>
<blockquote>

<p>AFAIKT Adobe <em>is</em> <em>eager to make their product even better</em>, and all input towards that is welcome. But, this thread didn&rsquo;t start as a <em>customer suggestion</em>, neither your revisitation of the topic sounded like one. But I agree that it is turning into a customer suggestion, for which I&rsquo;m thankful that you brought it up.</p>
<p>My replies were simply my interpretation of why a kerning tables feature isn&rsquo;t available in InDesign, and certainly do not express the reasons behind what went into the decision of not adding it. (FWIW, InDesign has been around longer than I&rsquo;ve been working for Adobe)</p>
<p>Having said that, I think it&rsquo;s time for all of us to steer this thread into the right direction (or start a new one), and contribute constructively for the discussion.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

I even kind of remember that it was based on an algorithm developed by (or inspired by) David Kinderleys work in that field. I may have understood all of that, but I did a lot of work with Id over the years, and hardly ever found fault with kerning Apart from some of the usual situations that would turn up (mostly specific to the Dutch language and my personal preferences) — these I solved manually.</p>
<p>In my Quark days (well, actually 13 years) I have used the Kerning tool only for global kerning (larger sizes, less space, etcetera). I DID use Fontographer to mess with really awkward fonts, mostly MonoType ones. : )</p>

<p>Optical spacing is definitely an improvement over Metric, at least for Perpetua Italic. But I am using this font in InDesign for a book and would really like to have been able to tweak it myself. If I were working in Quark I&rsquo;d spend about an hour improving it before I start laying out the book. This client is the only one I have who won&rsquo;t take Quark. I have at least 3 or 4 who use Quark exclusively, and several who take both. Quark Passport is a valuable tool for publishers who print foreign co-editions.

<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna bother with that thanks. That creates all sorts of other problems, such as then how does the client license the re-kerned font? Fugeddaboutit. I&rsquo;ll just have to weigh the kerning options b4 deciding which app to use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not compulsive about kerning, but often enough I find a font that needs some work and am used to being able to do that in the design app.</p>

<p>The EULA will tell you. Usually if the EULA allows modification the client just needs to own a copy of the original. Sometimes the person modifying it needs to own a copy too, but not always, for example if the work is technically (certainly not necessarily physically) in-house, or if you remove the font from your own computer once the work is complete. Many licenses are transferable, in which case as long the font is only present at one &ldquo;entity&rdquo; at a time you&rsquo;re legally OK with just one copy.</p>

<p>Miguel, I think it&rsquo;s interesting that both Charles and Patty are book designers, and both are recently switching to InDesign&ndash;one from TeX, one from Quark. To me that suggests a couple of things: first because of books' longevity that some people are willing to take more care in typographical detail. Second that maybe only recently are you getting book people on board with InDesign.</p>
<p>If these two very experienced designers are indicative, it would mean that the kerning feature is in fact important for people in book production, and having the feature might help win them over to InDesign.</p>

<p>Actually, I believe the optical kerning routine won&rsquo;t do this at all. I set quoteright-quotedblright in InDesign, and switching on optical kerning. Nothing happened &ndash; there were still three &ldquo;raised commas&rdquo; all together. No change in the note call spacing, either. Maybe I did something wrong. &amp;BTW, the space between a quotedbl(left or right) and a quote(left or right) is about half a word space, optically.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind having to kern some things by hand, in the file. In fact, our rule-of-thumb is all display type has to be hand-kerned, because what&rsquo;s right depends on the setting size, how many words there are in the line, etc., etc. Text is another matter &ndash; we had one comp that who had to spend 4 hours extra on a job hand-kerning all the note calls that followed a close quote, and finding all those bloody places where the open quotes were kerned back into a word space (this kerning was in the font), where something like an &ldquo;f&rdquo; preceded the word space. A number of times, the &ldquo;f&rdquo; was closer to the open quotes than the open quotes were to the letter that followed, even though technically a word space intervened. Customers would mark such proof &ldquo;P.E.&ndash;add word space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyway, four hours work &amp; a grumpy comp.</p>
<p>Oh &ndash; Bill, I don&rsquo;t really call myself a designer. I can design when needed, but I&rsquo;m only a compositor &ndash; what AIGA calls a &ldquo;tradesman.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Charles Ellertson &ndash; <cite>The more I work with OpenType, the more I’m against class-based kerning, on the grounds that creates more problems than it solves.</cite></p>
<p>Somehow I like the idea that an application, or suite of applications, allows to do &ldquo;font modifications&rdquo; externally to a font. Whether by modifying an AFM file (&ldquo;semi-external&rdquo;) or adding to a kerning preferences file. Doing these things externally, it does not matter at all whether a font&rsquo;s kerning is class based or not. Simply enumerating pairs is simple, but highly unproductive as regards font-internal kerning. External modifications can (should?) work without classes, irrespective of how the font is built internally.
The only issue I can imagine is when kerning gets contextualized.  ;-)</p>
<p>Other pluses of adjusting kerning externally to a font are (legal) avoiding EULA issues, and (usability, typographer&rsquo;s p.o.v.) avoiding different versions of a typeface on the HD.</p>
<p>hrant &ndash; <cite>Huh, ease? You want less work?! Actually I’ve personally become quite happy that InDesign doesn’t support the addition of custom kerning, because I just got a contract to respace a font that’s being used in an InDesign document. :-&gt;</cite></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Karsten,</p>
<p>In theory, I&rsquo;ve no complaints with an approach where kerning modification is external. In practice, it depends on how it works. I never used Quark, so what I don&rsquo;t know is if, once read in for a job, the kerning was always with a file, or you had to remember to read it in each time you opened a file.  For example, books go through a cycle of proofs. You finish the first proof &amp; ship it off to the customer. Six weeks or so later, proof is returned &amp; you make corrections. If the first proof used the external kerning program but you forget to read it in for second proof, all your line ending will change &ndash; or In InDesign, lines where the &ldquo;wax&rdquo; is disturbed. The problems due to the bugs with InDesign&rsquo;s  exception dictionary that can be made a part of the file come to mind.</p>
<p>Whatever, it would be an improvement on the current situation.</p>
<p>As to class based kerning, yes it is an aid in dealing with the increased character set of OpenType, but in practice, it all to often seems to be a token effort. Much kerning involves vowels, which take diacritics. Frequently the class for a vowel simply includes the vowels with all the diacritics, and unfortunate kerning results. And since the original &ldquo;kerner&rdquo; tends to deal with shapes rather than meaning, it is wasteful in a way; &ldquo;Gamma&rdquo; will never (rarely?) occur with &ldquo;e&rdquo; in a word, the characters are from different alphabets.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I confess I do use a little class-based kerning, but always feel a little guilty, as the values entered are usually a compromise I think I can get away with.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello Mr Ellertson, indeed class kerning&rsquo;s merits are at the same time its downsides. It is on the type designer to make good use of the possibilities which the technology offers, e.g. to care for diacritic. (This is best addressed in two ways: by defining exceptions to class kerning where necessary, and by designing diacritic marks such that they do not require too much space and so avoid collision at least in some cases.)
Personally, I would not dare touch an OpenType font&rsquo;s kerning information because I do not know the logic by which classes are made.</p>
<p>(As regards document reflow: I have spent some thoughts about how an InDesign implementation might look like. I can think of a solution which does not not change the kerning if the according user-defined kerning preference file is not present. And I think the way these kerning pairs are defined can be done more comfortable than in XPress' and Cool Kerning. The latter, however, does a very good job, because it only uses existing interface elements, and also avoids document reflow in case that the plugin is absent.)</p>

<p>For goodness sake (unless it&rsquo;s too terribly forward of me), call me Charles. All this started because long ago I was on another forum, where your <em>name</em> field was limited to 15 characters &ndash; my name doesn&rsquo;t fit. So I was &ldquo;Charles,&rdquo; until, inevitably, there was another &ldquo;Charles.&rdquo; I then became &ldquo;charles_e&rdquo;. The downside is when I feel strongly enough about something to make a statement &amp; don&rsquo;t want to do so anonymously, I have to put my full name at the bottom of the post.</p>
<p>When grandpa came over from what is now called Sogn og Fjordane &ndash; he wasn&rsquo;t the oldest son &amp; the farm was too small to split again &ndash; we sort of lost what was left of any old world manners. If I&rsquo;m being too forward, forgive me.</p>
