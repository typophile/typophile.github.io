  know and I may have jumped over the obvious but just can't pinpoint this font with
  that amazing ligature.\r\n\r\nHelp me out!\r\n\r\nHere is the link: http://www.coup.nl/coup2007/FM_uitnodiging.jpg

  body: My guess is that the designer modified a typeface like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/poster_bodoni_italic_std_ot/?sample_text=lustrum&sample_size=74">Poster
    Bodoni</a>. There are several of other customizations on that piece.
