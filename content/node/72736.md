  body: "Once I showed an ad to a client and he said \"make the logo bigger\".   The
    next day I showed him a layout with it 20% SMALLER and said \"This is yesterday's
    layout\", and then showed him the original layout and said \"Here's the new one\".\r\n\r\nMy
    client smiled and said \"Now it's perfect!\"\r\n\r\nI rarely do that kind of thing,
    as I think it's best to be honest with clients, and feedback from clients can
    sometimes result in a layout that really is better, but in this case the client
    had a lousy sense of design and I knew that making it bigger would look awful.\r\n"
