  <em>Theatrum Artis Scribendi</em>, a very rare book of European handwriting specimens.
  Seeing as how even the facsimile editions are hard to come by, I decided to photograph
  all of the original pages and put it online. Following are a few samples; the entire
  thing can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.dunwichtype.com/pdfs/tas.pdf\">http://www.jpad.biz/pdfs/tas.pdf</a>.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/title_5999.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/33_5262.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/41_3792.jpg]"
