body: "I'm having some troubles with the Calluna font by exljbris in combination with
  the LaTeX typesetting software. For the technical details I'm trying to get some
  support at stackexchange, so I won't bother you with it, but to make my problem
  reproducible for other people I need a font with the following properties:\r\n<ul><li>Available
  for free, without registration</li><li>Provides both oldstyle and lining figures</li><li>Has
  oldstyle figures as default numerals, so the character called <code>one</code> is
  an oldstyle figure</li></ul>\r\nCalluna Regular fits all these requirements, except
  it is not available without registration, and that currently holds people back from
  trying to reproduce my problem, so I wondered if there is a legal way to get another
  font that fits these requirements. Most fonts installed by default on any computer
  provide either oldstyle or lining, and if they provide both they have lining as
  default figures.."

  body: Don't know of any. Alegreya comes closest, oldstyle figures are default, and
    it has the SIL OFL license. But the lining figures, while in the font, are not
    "hooked up" via a features statement, and that can give odd occurrences.

  body: I just found a font that's part of (at least) the TeXlive distribution, so
    probably available for most of the people over at stackexchange, and that's "EB
    Garamond 12".

    Source and the source files are included, you can tweak it to your preferences.\r\nhttp://www.impallari.com/projects/update/94\r\n\r\n"
