body: Hi everybody, For the Python chapter in my upcoming book, Learn FontLab Fast
  &#40;to be released in July at TypeCon--Read about it at <a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com"
  target="_blank">http://www.logofontandlettering.com</a>&#41; I&#39;m asking for
  some typical Python scripts that I can use in the book.  <BR> <BR>I won&#39;t go
  into explaining Python programming &#40;those of you who know me know that it would
  probably kill me to get into that&#41;, I just want to present helpul, ready-made
  Python scripts designed to solve common problems so other FontLab users can plug
  them in. <BR> <BR>Please explain what the script does, then provide either a screenshot
  of the programming window with the script  entered, or just paste the script into
  an email to me at <a href="mailto:lescab@flashfonts.com">lescab@flashfonts.com</a>.  <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;ll credit everybody who submits a script I use. <BR>Thanks, <BR>Leslie
