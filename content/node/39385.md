  I searched for previous relevant threads, I failed to note that this should probably
  be posted in \"Design\" until it was too late... could a mod move the thread?  My
  apologies. :)"

    Mostra, \r\nhttp://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/mostra.html\r\nor House Industries'
    Neutra.\r\n\r\nFor a \"serif movie title lettering\" font, maybe something from
    Letterhead Fonts or Nick's Fonts.\r\nYou may be interested in Ephemera foundry--in
    Indie Fonts 3."

  body: "Thanks Nick, for the tips.\r\n\r\nSatya,\r\n\r\nThese being hand-painted
    would definitely explain the subtle inconsistencies in the 'A's of L'Atalante
    and the 'E's of Regle du Jeu...\r\n\r\nHowever, would they have been hand-painting
    off a model or guide typeface?"

  body: "Lettering manuals generally showed both pure lettering styles, and lettering
    styles based on typefaces.\r\nThat R in R\xE8gle is too poorly rendered to be
    a type form, although it may be a loose interpretation of such. Nevertheless,
    it doesn't seem out of place in the general casual execution of the lettering."

    it's Art Deco typefaces that you should be looking for.\r\n\r\nMostra looks great.
    So does Blakely and Goldenbook.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to search further, you could
