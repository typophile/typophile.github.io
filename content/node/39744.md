  print outs of animated GIFs that we build. So far, it's been sort of a hassle, spending
  far too much time on this process (copy merged on each frame, paste into a new document
  etc).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a script or action that will do this? Much appreciated.\r\n\r\nSean

    should also be able create single images from each frame.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yeah I work in interactive and generally print out all my work to present
    internally. Honestly it's easier than building it first and then having to go
    back and change things. And I like that I can make notes right on the print outs.\r\n\r\nI
    haven't found a quick way to make one page spreads of banner gifs. I just memorized
    the proper key commands and copy pasta all my stuff into photoshop for printing..\r\n\r\nI
    use the image ready multi picture contact sheet function sometimes, but it isn't
    very pretty."
