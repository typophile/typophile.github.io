  are stuffed animals for kids that are going to be sold in a zoo. I would appreciate
  if someone have any other ideas on color, shape, etc. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\nSusan"

  body: "Okay I love anything with VAG Rounded in it. Umm... I would shove 'happy'
    over to the right of 'zoo' and I'd be extra careful that the all the colors are
    of equal saturation... the colors are a dad dull on my CRT.\r\n\r\nAnyhow... excellent
    visual pun and it high in cuteness factor!\r\n\r\n\r\nMike Diaz"

  body: maybe you could add more brightness to the colours by dropping the black outline?
    i don't think it's necessary on 'zoo' and the "mouth".

  body: "Pallette made me think McDonalds probably the red and proportions of the
    frame. Does the Z have to be uppercase? Happy seems out of proportion to zoo,
    I would look at increasing the size.\r\nTim"
