  it's not the exact font I need, but rather something that looks like it, ideas for
  similar modern sans fonts are welcome as well. Thanks!\r\n"

    post. I opened up a Wallpaper and there it was again. I searched Typophile for
    Wallpaper ID and found it. \r\n\r\nIt's called Amplitude and can be found here:
    http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude\r\n\r\nFor my kind of budget it's a
    little too expensive (1.750 $ for 2-5 cpu license) so I'm still interested in
    alternatives. Thanks!"

    for starters. \r\n\r\nWhat properties of Amplitude would you like in your alternative?
    \r\nParisine doesn\u2019t have those \u2018character adding\u2019 ink traps."

    as individual styles. No one expects you to pay a lot of money if you only need
    a few weights and widths. You can view, test, and select particular styles by
    hitting the \"STYLES\" tab\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude/styles\r\n\r\nArizona
    Daily Star commissioned smoothed-out versions for headlines, which I think is
    what Tiffany referred to. Designer Christian Schwartz shows a preview of this
    on his site: http://www.orangeitalic.com/amphead.shtml Amplitude Headline is currently
    available to publication designers. Once the family is entirely filled out, Font
    Bureau will publish it online. If you're interested in Amplitude Headline specifically,
    or other Font Bureau sans, just get in touch with us.\r\n\r\nand this is just

  body: "Hey again,\r\n\r\nThansk for your replies. And thanks to Robb for the tip
    about individual styles. I should only need about 6 styles which brings it down
    to 360$ for 2-5 cpu license. That sounds fair. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering when the
    sans-traps is available, Miss Tiffany?\r\n\r\nI like Parisine as well and Xtra
    sans looks good too. What In Amplitude is that it easy too read, it has some nice
    styles that mixes well and most of all: it doesn't havwe the feel of helvetica,
    Berthold Akzidenz grotesk, Franklin Gothick etc. which I love and have used a
    lot, but really need some time away from."
