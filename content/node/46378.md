  I got into a discussion about how much input clients have at larger agencies. I
  work at a small firm ( < 10 people), in a small market, and the philosophy is: no
  matter what the client wants, give it to them. \r\n\r\nIs this the same at larger
  agencies? I recognize that no matter where you work the people that fit the bill
  will always have last say, but what about when they're running with scissors? What
  if they say I want my logo fonts changed to Lucida Calligraphy and Comic Sans????
  <--Reason for this post."

    ourselves on being good at what we do - that's why the client hired us. if they
    want to dictate type choices, they should hire a production artist and skip the
    agency fees.\r\n\r\nwhenever clients dictate things like this for no reason, reason
    it out of them. Justify your typefaces and why theirs are wrong for the brand
    for whatever reason. If you let them run all over you, they won't respect you
    and you'll be stuck doing production work instead of designing. "

    I think the skill set in some organizations can manage the client, and in many
    ways you have to, since ultimately, we won't produce anything unless the client
    signs off first.\r\n\r\nIf your creative and marketing presentations on a campaign
    contain \"researched detail\" on the effectiveness of your proposed imagery, copy,
    graphics, type choices upon the target audience, you just might get away from
    facing the clients \"personal preferences\" for color or photos, etc.\r\n\r\nI
    have had comments from very big clients on very large interactive projects asking
    us to change the shape of a \"button\" on the global navigation. \"Yes sir, we
    will look into that with our Information Architect and Creative Director. But
    you see, sir, they specifically selected this particular shape since the click-through
    rate just happens to be 12% higher than your suggested shape, sir.\"\r\n\r\nBusiness
    is business, and art isn't."

    lacking on the strategy/research side. You don't hire an expert and then tell
    them how to do their job. \r\n\r\nYou can fix this... Sii is right. Put together
    rationale for your recommendations. If the cost of fonts is an issue at least
    be more creative with free options  than Comic Sans!"

    the process, but likely shouldn't be art directing.\r\n\r\nThe best lesson I ever
    learned is that the client *is* always right. Your job as the design firm, is
    to make sure the client picks the best solution. If the client ends up dictating
    the project where the solution is compromised, it's less the client's fault and
    more the firm's fault for not selling them the right solution. \r\n\r\nA big part
    of good design is SELLING good design. ;o)"

    not lame or elitist, it's just having an educated opinion. Designers have to have
    opinions; usually strong ones. And its not about being jerks, its about being
    discriminating for the right reasons -- correct design principles, informed aesthetic
    judgement, experience   in the market.\r\n\r\nChefs don't use margarine. Designers
    don't use crap fonts. &c.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have to support Randy's axiom about
    Mexican joints. At least the ones in Southern California."
