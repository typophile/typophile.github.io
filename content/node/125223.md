body: "Russell McGorman is a designer and artist, living and working in Toronto, Ontario,
  Canada.\r\n\r\nUpon graduating from the Ontario College of Art and Design, Russell
  worked for a time as a welder-fitter, capitalizing on his study of modern sculpture.
  His career in the graphics arts began as a silk-screen printer and production designer
  at Multiple Arts, a small shop in Toronto which specialized in close to everything.
  There he worked on a diverse range of projects, from POP displays to store fronts,
  to museum displays and prop graphics and signage for film sets, to control panels
  for oil rigs and power generating plants.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of years of that,
  Russell accepted a position as a Signage and Special Products designer at GO Transit,
  a major regional public transit agency and then for Metrolinx, (of which GO Transit
  is now a division), where he still works as a Wayfinding Specialist.\r\n\r\nHe also
  runs Our House Graphics, his part-time freelance design studio which is currently
  concentrating on the design of retail typefaces.\r\n\r\nRussell began designing
  and publishing typefaces in 2009. It began with the simple question, \u201CHow exactly
  do digital typefaces work, and how are they made?\u201D and quickly progressed to
  designing and publishing his own growing catalogue of fonts, all of which are created
  with a passion for excellence and a love for the art and science of type.\r\n\r\nRetail
