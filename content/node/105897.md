body: "I've been working on a sans serif medium weight text font -- I've been proofing
  it roughly in illustrator (mac platform) and been pretty happy. I'm getting close
  to finished now and started looking at it in InDesign. And the hinting is just crazy
  weird.\r\n\r\nIn smaller sized, 10 and below, the overshoots on the rounded glyphs
  are really exaggerated, bouncing way below the baseline and way over the x height.
  It looks horrible on screen but still prints out just fine.\r\n\r\nI have tried
  both FontLab's auto hinting and The ADFKO hinting macro and pretty much have the
  same problem.\r\n\r\nOddly, the hinting looks very nice in Word...\r\n\r\nHow do
  I correct this? I have looked at the manual and hinting by hand seems awfully daunting."

  body: Have you applied appropriate vertical alignment (blue) zones in the font?
    Your baseline blue zone, for example, should cover both flat and overshoot shapes.
    Also, check that your BlueScale value setting conforms to <a href="http://typophile.com/node/42172">recommendations</a>.

  body: "I've been messing around with the alignment zone settings trying to see if
    they have any effect. I'll admit the recommendations from John (above) pretty
    much had my head spinning.\r\n\r\nAside from the basic hinting macro, I am wondering
    what is the point of dealing with it past that point if Adobe apps are going to
    do what they want regardless.\r\n\r\nExcept my font looks ugly in many sizes and
    resolutions. And it's NOT a particularly ugly font. So I will need to figure something
    out..."

  body: "Yes, Adobe uses its own rasteriser, which is why the results may look different
    between Adobe and MS apps, but both make use of hinting to arrive at those results.\r\n\r\nWhen
    creating your outlines, did you conform to PS font recommendations regarding nodes
    at extrema and outline efficiency? Hints interoperate with outline structure,
    and if you don't have nodes properly arranged the hints won't help and may produce
    errors."

  body: "I usually handle nodes at the extremas carefully. And it is easy to do with
    broad curves. with smaller shapes, if the extremes start messing with my outlines
    -- I occasionally ignore them. But not very often and not with this font.\r\n\r\nI
    have been messing around with the blue vertical alignment zones in the hinting
    layer and futzed with some of the numbers in the additional hinting parameters
    fields.\r\n\r\nSome results were better, some worse. It is a relief to know that
    Adobe doesn't ignore this stuff completely with it's proprietary rasterizer. I
    am hoping with a little more experimentation I can dial things in..."
