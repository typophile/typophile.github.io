body: I&#39;m new to this forum, but as a proofreader I often have clarification questions.
  <BR> <BR>So, can anyone tell me the reason behind putting in the ly, or leaving
  it out? Opinions differ around here. Thank you!!

  body: It&#39;s a question of context. Important is an adjective, importantly an
    adverb. <BR> <BR>&#34;Of all the reasons for war, the most important is....&#34;
    &#40;important is an adjective modifying reasons&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;Why did we
    go to war? Most importantly, we went because the President said....&#34; &#40;importantly
    is an adverb, modifying went&#41; <BR> <BR>Note that in the second sentence it
    would not be unusual to leave out the verb phrase &#34;we went,&#34; yet it would
    still be implied. <BR> <BR>Leastways, that&#39;s my understanding. But it&#39;s
    been many years since I made my living as an editor. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Thank you for replying. What do you do now instead of editing? <BR> <BR>I
    usually deal with the &#34;ly&#34; issue when it begins a sentence, for instance:
    <BR> <BR>&#34;But most important,&#34; <BR>or <BR>&#34;Most importantly...&#34;
    <BR> <BR>My question is are those correct &#40;respectively&#41;? And why? <BR>
    <BR>Thanks again!'

  body: Gina, as Tom has explained, it depends whether what is &#39;most important&#39;
    is a noun or a verb. At the beginning of a sentence, it depends what follows,
    e.g. <BR> <BR>&#39;Most importantly, we should CONSIDER [verb] whether the phrase
    applies to a noun or to a verb.&#39; <BR> <BR>&#39;Most important, in our consideration,
    is the QUESTION [noun] whether the phrase applies to a noun or to a verb.&#39;
