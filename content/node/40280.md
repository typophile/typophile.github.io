  body: "When setting a section with a lot of two line paragraphs I personally try
    to have the page breaks between paragraphs. This means ending pages a line short
    frequently. Sometimes it is possible to give or take a line if there is a picture
    or figure on a page to adjust the layout. I try extremely hard to have the same
    numbers of lines on each spread. I find this very important. If a page lack a
    line, both pages on that spread should lack a line.\r\nAs long as I'm consequent
    and have good reasons, I feel I can stand by my choices and defend them if anybody
    asks. None of my clients/editors have ever mentioned anything about it, and I
    honestly do not think the public in general notice.\r\nAlso I find it faster to
    handle incoming corrections after proof reading if I do the layout in this way,
    an advantage when deadlines are tight.\r\nI'm sure others have far more sophisticated
    ways and other rules they follow.\r\nBest of luck with the book."

  body: "Thanks for the reply. I agree completely, yet there are still times when
    the text seems to fight back. In the book I'm working on now, there are SO MANY
    2-line graphs that the \"line short\" solution on one page creates problems further
    along, and I find myself going round in circles. As it happens in this book, most
    times the last line of the paragraph is a half line in length, so I can't adjust
    the tracking to bring a line up or down. Pages that are 2 lines short look awful.
    Should I go into real estate? :)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "When I find myself going in circles like you describe, I have on occasions
    removed a line above a nearby header to see what looks less disturbing to the
    layout. Most often the missing line above the header looks worse. I tell myself
    for comfort that a lot of short paragraphs on a spread will camouflage the missing
    lines at the bottom of the pages.\r\nThere is another solution that is a bit more
    on the dark side, but on the bright side gives you perfect text distribution.
    It involves reading the text and edit it, without changing the meaning, until
    the layout is perfect. Not recommended as the outcome could be much like in real
    estate ..."
