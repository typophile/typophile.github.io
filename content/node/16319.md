  body: This looks familiar because it is a lettering style that was very popular
    in the 80s. I suspect this is hand lettered and wouldn't know of any equivalent
    digital script font. There are fonts in the same vein though, for example [[Font
    Bureau]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FB.9430.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=Risky+Business&sampleSize=24"
    target="new">Raceway</a>.
