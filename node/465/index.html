		<div class="commentbody">Oh, now I get it. <BR>I think it's very simple. Uppercase need to be slightly heavier than lowercase. Otherwise, since Uc letters have more white space around them, they (Uc) would look lighter than lc. <BR>But it should be just a slight extra weight. No more than 110%, I think. Of course, this percentage depends on the typeface too, some typeface may need more Uc extra weight. <BR>A priori, there's no negative consequences. It's just a necessary optical adjustment.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi BJ, <BR> <BR>Thanks for starting up this thread. I haven't come to a difinative answer on this yet. I scaled back the caps in my Friday Fonts thread. They went from 112% to 106%. What i wanted was for them to optically look the same. As I got darker in weight, the difference went up slightly. I think the Black weight is 109%. The light weight I recently posted will be around 105%.  <BR> <BR>Here's what I did with my lunchhour: <BR>Adobe Garamond <BR>Bembo <BR>Bauer Bodoni <BR>ITC Officina Serif <BR>Neue Helvetica <BR>Futura <BR>Univers <BR> <BR>(Rounded to the nearest integer) <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/12350.gif" alt="cap weight comparison"> <BR> <BR>Perhaps we will see a trend that serifs have a larger difference? Bembo need to go on a diet! Actually heavy caps has always been a beef for me about Bembo. <BR> <BR>As far as the Ed Benguiat LC o = UC stem, here are the grades for the roman weights: <BR> <BR>AGaramond: cap too narrow <BR>Bembo: cap too wide <BR>BBadoni: cap too wide <BR>Officina Serif: exact <BR> <BR>NHelv: cap slightly wide <BR>Futura: cap slightly wide <BR>Univers: exact <BR> <BR>So much for my theory about bolder weights having more % difference between cap and lc! <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">BJ, <BR> <BR>Have you made any headway on your 20-25 fonts? I'd like to see a broader sampling, and more contemporary designs (last 10years) to see how they stack up. <BR> <BR>I've decided my personal preference is between 103 - 110%. Anything more seems dark to me. Although I must admit my test is flawed. I'm comparing horizontal width of the stem of the h with the stem of the H. This doesn't neccesarily fully take into account the font's modulation. For example, Adobe Garamond. The roman weight is 111%, but text settings don't look dark. I think this is because on the &quot;width of lc 'o' = UC stem&quot; test the caps looked narrow. This tells me the over all color is even, dispite the &quot;heavy&quot; % <BR> <BR>Hope that makes some sense? <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">bj &ndash; <BR> <BR>As you've said, there isn't a fixed percentage. It's an  <BR>*optical* compensation, so you have to *look* and see  <BR>what it needs. Some designs might need more, some  <BR>might not. It may also depend a little upon cultural trends,  <BR>and also perhaps printing technology (see below). <BR> <BR>If you had asked me I probably would have told you  <BR>that I made the Whitman capital stem 110% of the  <BR>lowercase. But I see now that I didn't. Go figure. <BR> <BR>In writing about the cutting of Linotype Monticello  <BR>(a revival of Binny &amp; Ronaldson's Pica Roman No. 1,  <BR><i>aka</i> Oxford) C.H. Griffith wrote that he was surprised  <BR>at how heavy the capitals appeared in contemporary  <BR>proofs made with type freshly cast from the original  <BR>matrices, compared to specimens from the original era.  <BR>The theory he developed was that 19th century printing  <BR>technique tended to build up more color on the lowercase  <BR>than the capitals and the typefounder then added more  <BR>weight to the capitals to compensate and get them to  <BR>print more in harmony with the lowercase. But 20th  <BR>century technique did not have the same effect and so  <BR>the extra weight in the capitals was more pronounced  <BR>in his contemporary proofs. The result is that he slimmed  <BR>down the weight in the capitals in order to get an  <BR>equivalent harmony in Linotype Monticello. <BR> <BR>I seem to remember Matthew saying that when he did  <BR>his recent digital revival of Monticello, he chose to slim  <BR>the weight of the capitals even further, relative to the  <BR>lowercase, because the capitals of 19th-century style  <BR>types (even as adjusted by Griffith in the 50s) still  <BR>tended to look too heavy to the modern eye.  <BR> <BR>I say, Trust your eyes. And if you don't trust your eyes  <BR>yet, then train them by looking closely at other typefaces  <BR>and developing your own judgement about which look  <BR>balanced in the capitals and which do not. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR> <BR></div>

[&hellip;] <BR>&gt;you can agree with his &quot;method&quot;/method - or not. <BR>&gt;and always ask - why 1/3 wider?  <BR>&gt;is that fixed? quantitative? subjective? <BR> <BR>See, in this case (if I understand your questions  <BR>correctly), the more we try to achieve &quot;fixed&quot; values  <BR>(proportions, weights, etc), the more we get arbitrary  <BR>(&quot;subjective&quot;) ones. <BR> <BR>I don't know much about Leach's work, so I may be  <BR>wrong, but his method sounds highly arbitrary to me,  <BR>because it doesn't seem to care about other factors  <BR>that might affect optical compensation. For example,  <BR>heavy typefaces would need larger (round-shapes)  <BR>compensation than thin ones. <BR> <BR>&gt;a good study is Bodoni and Sheldon [&hellip;] <BR>&gt;so &mdash; is that fixed? quantitative? <BR> <BR>I think you kinda answered your own question. ;-) <BR>It's not fixed, each typeface has its very own  <BR>proportions (horizontal, vertical, weights, contrasts,  <BR>etc). And all those little details make them what they  <BR>are. <BR> <BR> <BR>&gt;[&hellip;] I don't think these are rhetorical questions. <BR> <BR>They're kinda rhetorical, I think. Like Bj said, there's no  <BR>definitive answer. To me, in this case, the questioning <BR>*is* the answer itself. ;-) <BR> <BR></div>
