  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A software company to which I am contracted asked me to redesign their brand in the blink of an eye.(a couple of days) As all my time is inundated by a pile of other &ldquo;urgent and more important&rdquo; work to do for this same client and I am not receiving any additional resources (more money nor more time) I will not be able to dedicate the amount of attention to this project that any branding effort truly deserves. However I have never in my career delivered mediocre work and lacking any time at all in which to conceive a brand is still no excuse. I therefore turn to you and to any one who wishes to supply their input. Specifically I am requesting any input on the word mark concept I have started. This image only demonstrates the lettering concept but none of the letters are finalized yet. I like the M and U. I also believe the A once refined will work nicely. The Z, once drawn properly, might also work but I want to draw suggestions on it. As for the T and the H they are my biggest concern as I would like their form to be a bit more harmonies with the other letters.</p>
<p>Please provide impute asap.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment on the quick concept sketch I placed. Unfortunately it seem that almost no one read what I wrote or that I did not express myself clearly as every one seems to address this as a completed design rather than a quick thumbnail to try to communicate a concept. The X-height and strokes are irrelevant and arbitrary at this point. Also arbitrarily drawn is the crossbar on the A, H and t although I want suggestions on unifying them. The general concept that I like and was trying to communicate was how the bowl curve of the u plays off the M and it’s apex and have these counter echoed by the A. What I do not like is that I have not yet arrived at how to make all the letters compatible. Expressing that the H or z needs work dose not help me as I am very well aware of all that is wrong with those quickly drawn letter forms. My problem is that I do not have the time to dedicate to make the portion of the concept I like work within a hole. This is why I placed the quick sketch here to solicit specific ideas as to how to make all the letters work as a unified hole and still retain the element of the M, U and A playing off each other.</p>
<p>Please provide specific ideas as to how to make the letters work.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The A gets too much attention - perhaps  connect the crossbar all the way? It feels scaled down compared to the m, and therefore out of balance.</p>
<p>Maybe you could play with some ligatures somewhere, too? (th comes to mind)</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m concerned the letters are so flat they won&rsquo;t scale down very well.</p>

<p>Well, it may not have been specifically asked for, but then where is the place?  I brought up the point because Alfonso clearly doesn&rsquo;t have enough time to fully work out a single concept. While we can help him formally with letter constructions, I think it far more relevant and instructive to help him solve what&rsquo;s really a business and client/designer relationship problem. If he can solve that, then he&rsquo;ll have more time to consider his concepts and work it further so Typophile&rsquo;s readers can provide better constructive criticism.</p>
<p>And to push myself further into dark territory (and echo others' sentiments), I don&rsquo;t feel we should be providing too much help for those that whip off a quick wordmark and throw it to the gallery. We&rsquo;re not here to do your work for you.</p>

<p>Your logo is only letterforms at this point, and you were given critique on those. If the letters were drawn arbitrarily and without thought, and you knew what was wrong with them, then why did you submit them for critique?</p>

But I read most of the comments and I find a Font chosen to be passé and cheap looking or if its custom its done in a style that will not last. Sorry for being blunt, but there are a large number of alternative Fonts available for a really professional word mark. Also, these day we sometimes get requests from clients that are pressing and may not pay enough. But with most clients we are building a relationship. This being said, relationship always needs both parties to give and receive, both ways. But you must never sell yourself short of your Professional Quality Work and craftsmanship, unless its for a Non-Profit Org. I&rsquo;ve done very professional Word marks for many clients and if they don&rsquo;t understand the value, then you are journeying to the &ldquo;Free&rdquo; and cheap zone. Branding should never be approached in this manner, because its major implications and of its importance to any company.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i think there are other issues here, even aside from working for free. i&rsquo;ll work for free at times (pro bono, anyone?), if it&rsquo;s a project i think warrants it or if i know it will lead to something down the road. but on those occassions, i actually want my BEST work to surface. but to agree to something like that, esp. in the manner presented <em>(A software company to which I am contracted asked me to redesign their brand in the blink of an eye.(a couple of days) As all my time is inundated by a pile of other “urgent and more important” work to do for this same client and I am not receiving any additional resources (more money nor more time) </em> can only lead to disasterous work. why would someone consent to those conditions?</p>
<p>additionally, i believe alfonso received some very constructive feedback on his post, all of which seemed summarily dismissed. what the heck?</p>
