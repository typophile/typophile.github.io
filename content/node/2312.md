  body: ' yes. as a matter of fact it is good idea: type for web is more or less a
    question of a few fonts. everybody uses them. but if you use the same fonts for
    the rest of your publications, identity is lost. because everybody uses them.

    just a &#39;mark.&#39; In which case I&#39;d <BR>also say yes. It&#39;s a good
    idea unless you&#39;re  <BR>using Helvetica and Impact because you can&#39;t get  <BR>the
    right set of weights. &#40;Just one lame example.&#41; <BR> <BR>But, in general,
    it seems to make little sense to make  <BR>rules about this stuff, when it&#39;s
    totally dependent on how  <BR>you&#39;re using it and what it&#39;s for. '

    as being &#34;compatible&#34; or &#34;appropriate&#34;. So long as the combination
    is thoroughly thought through in terms of the messages it gives out, its range,
    readability, the typographic structure you intend to use and, of course, its historical
    contexts, it should not matter. '

  body: ' it would be a branding nightmare if we only used one. think of what would
    be the difference between a title, sub-head and body text...bolds? another bold
    a heavy? and an underline? - it would look like a high school essay produced in
    word doc. <BR> <BR>a designer&#39;s mark should be in matching pairs of type for
    collateral and corp systems. '

    on final design. Amazing considering all the skills they possess in relation to
