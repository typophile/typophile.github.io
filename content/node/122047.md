  the minimum printing space usage characteristics of Linden Hill but is a regular
  serif and not a slab serif.\r\n\r\nI would also like to know if it  is possible
  to design fonts using a computer instead of manually drawing  them on a drawing
  board. If it is, what are some good application programs to use to design fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any feedback you can provide.\r\n\r\nJim Williams"

    professional quality fonts.\r\nFor simple fonts there is an online program called
    FontStrut http://fontstruct.com/\r\nFor a free program that can produce good quality
    fonts you might consider FontForge. You might start by reading the wiki article
    about the program http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FontForge\r\nIf you are familiar
    with Adobe Illustrator, it can be used to design fonts.\r\nDon \r\n\r\n"
