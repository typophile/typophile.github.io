body: Hey all, I've been designing for quite some time now and I'm getting to the
  point where I would like to step back and organize everything. I need somewhat of
  a crash course in font management. I have purchased several respected families and
  every time I choose to use them I have to sift through tons of dead weight. I'm
  not sure which font managers are best for Mac OSX, or really how to use them. Any
  help would be much appreciated. Also, in my user/library/fonts there are several
  fonts I find that I would never use, can these be deleted? I am just tired of my
  font list in my applications being 100+fonts. Thanks for any help you can give!!!
