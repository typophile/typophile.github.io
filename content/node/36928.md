    of Ms. Winfrey on every cover, uses Hoefler Text.

    magazine has been using Hoefler Text as its text face for a while now. (Also Hoefler
    Titling in heads.) I'm sure I've seen it in other magazines, but can't think of
    them off hand.\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "Have you thought about checking with the Hoefler foundry and asking them?
    Perhaps  designers have sent them copies of books set in Hoefler Text. They could
    tell you ISBNs and you could get the books through a library.\r\n\r\nDesigners
    should send samples of their design work with new types to those who design those
    types. Typeface designers appreciate seeing their work in use. This can also set
    up rewarding dialogue between the maker of a face and the user of the face. That
    has been my experience the past few years.\r\n\r\nHmmm . . . . that reminds me:
    I have not yet sent Hoefler a copy of a poetry anthology I set recently in Requiem.
    Thanks for the nudge.\r\n\r\npowers"

    What with the curious publishing history of this book, I sure did forget to follow
    my own dictum. A copy goes in the mail to you today. We've sold over 20,000 copies
    of this book [not bad for a first book from a small publisher], so lots of readers
    have seen Whitman.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "Hello again:\r\n\r\nI checked with the foundry a few days back regarding
    Hoefler Text <em>and Requiem Text</em> for books. The representative did not know
    of any instance off hand. However, I did receive and examine the new Hoefler &
    Frere Jones type catalog. \r\n\r\nIsn't it funny how we form opinions (sometimes
    damning opinions) about type we see as online samples of repertoires or comprehensive
    pdf's we downloaded from foundries, then to have that opinion totally change once
    we see it in print? \r\n\r\nFor instance, Verlag- not very pretty to me on screen
    (perhaps even ugly), looks much better in print. I'll still take Neutraface tho
    :-) \r\nWe see things much differently don't we?\r\n\r\nWith regards to Hoefler
    Text (the swashy italics excepted), I see it as a face that is so neutral that
    you only focus on the meaning of the words, not their shapes (much in the same
    fashion as Minion). It also feels \"literary\" but I wonder: is it \"literary\"
    for magazines or \"literary\" for books? H&FJ catalog is printed on coated stock
    (kromecote?) - perhaps this has something to do with it.\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

  body: "I just set a book in Hoefler Text (and Titling). It worked great; the letters
    look \"black\" and strong, and the page has a nice, old typographic feel, more
    \"letter press\" than digital, in some way. Besides the obviuos resemblance to
    Linotype Janson Text (Hoefler's main influence), to my eye Hoefler Text has some
    kind of similitude to ITC New Baskerville - not the type design, but the way it
    looks, the way the letters and the ink fit the paper. Very different from Adobe
    Garamond, to say. What doesn't seem to work, at least to my eye, is Italic in
    long reading: there's a sequence of 4 pages set entirely in Italic and it looks
    too heavy to me. And an alternate Q cap Italic would be helpful - the default
    one is elegant but perhaps too baroque to some contemporary reader's eye (by the
    way, I disagree with Mike: this font isn't \"neutral\" at all; it's very personal.
    Times New Roman in a book looks neutral :-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, it would be interesting
    to see how Hoefler Titling, which is a much \"finer\" typeface, would work in
    small size. It looks nice even in 13 points, but I'm not sure how it would work
    in 11, or 8 points."
