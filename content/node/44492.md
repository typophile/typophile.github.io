    think I'll leave this to the pros. At least for now.\r\nI hope the pros aren't
    too busy! I'm curious as to how they'd do this\u2026 certainly there's many ways

    by sheer cohesion.

  body: "It's probably not in the spirit of the battle for me to admire my opponents,
    but I think Christian's Zebramond is really charming. It kind of reminds me of
    Kris Sowerby's <a href=\"http://klim.co.nz/custom_hoko.php\">Hokotohu</a> with
    its ornamented letterforms, but it also has an organic inked-in quality to it.
    I can picture it being used on a logotype somewhere.\r\n\r\nWith my entry, I concentrated
    too much on combining Garamond's outlines and Zebrawood's internal patterns so
    that the allusion to each design was as clear as possible. It serves the purpose
    of this battle, but I doubt it's going to amount to much outside it.\r\n\r\nAnd
    so far, no one has called me out for cheating and only using lowercase letters
    confined to the x-height. It was unintended, I swear..."

    background and retraced them with minimal alteration. So much of that being automated,
    though, I'm becoming less sure if that counts as drawing from scratch.\r\n\r\nIf
    I had the time, though, I would have created a freer variation on the theme like
    Christian has. If you look closely at my entry's background white, you can see
    artifacts of combining layers to create the chromatic effect, indicating what
    a rushed bang-up job it was."
