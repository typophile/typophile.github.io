body: I was checking the new releases on myfonts yesterday and found <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jan-fromm/camingo/">Camingo</A>.
  Any thoughts on this? Has anyone used it? I bought ITC Tabula a while back and have
  been disappointed (I should have bought Section from Village). But this has a similar
  geometric structure that I am drawn to, but is more subtle. Considering this was
  designed by a student of Lucas de Groot I am a bit more confident that it will be
  a well-made typeface. Just wondering what your thoughts are.

    own Klavika which suffices for my square sans needs.\r\n\r\nHowever, it looks
    like a fairly complete family."

  body: This is much more subtle than Klavika (which I like too), which is one of
    the reasons I think I like it so much. I think I may get more mileage out of Camingo.
    Has anyone used it yet? For kicks here is a comparison of some recent square sans
    designs (off the top of my head)...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/square-sans_5277.jpg]

  body: Good ones Patty. I have Neo. There are a lot of Emigre faces that have a single
    character that I can't stand. Ruins it for me as well.

  body: I agree that Unit, Fago and Zine are similar. Cachet isn't feasible for me,
    since it has only 3 weights, no italics, etc. Which reminds me of Zemestro - another
    one. Are there any thoughts in regards to the craftsmanship of this typeface?

  body: "Camingo has a lot of nasty little attention getters that bug me. For example:\r\n-
    There's too much flourish in the descender of f. I love f with a pretty descender\u2013I
    make my handwritten f descenders so crazy that my notes are often illegible. But
    it doesn't fit with the rest of the letters.\r\n- The A is gross\u2013the internal
    and external apexes are too close\u2013it's annoying. It's worse on the bold weights,
    where it looks like a little white triangle fighting for freedom. \r\n- Why are
    the outer vertical strokes of the M diagonals? It's like the M from Lithos snuck
    in when nobody was watching.\r\n\r\nI could stay up all night nitpicking at the
    letterforms in this one. I'll just keep using Unit instead."

  body: JPAD, thanks for your comments, I'll look at those items more closely. I hate
    licensing a typeface without examining it closely first, those things jump out
    at you later. Miles, I love Foundry Form too. It would be nice if they had a more
    user-friendly site. Their type is so nice, the site should be equally well-done.

    tail on the 'a', but Vista is a much more usable typeface in the same vein."

  body: "The genre of sophisticated square sans faces, where squareness is integrated
    into a conventional sans effect by subtle drawing, has come on strong since I
    investigated square types in a magazine article, <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/Hip2BSqr.pdf\">Hip
    2B Square</a>, 10 years ago \r\n\r\nDave Farey's Cachet was one of the first of
    this new breed, IIRC, and may even have been released when I wrote the article,
    but I didn't anticipate the way things would develop enough to mention it. In
    fact according to Dave, squareness wasn't the main theme of Cachet.\r\n\r\nA lot
    of ideas that were raw ten or 15 years ago have been cooked up nicely."
