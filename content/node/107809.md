body: "Hello, I am looking for an alternative to Acid by Stephen Baum. I realize it
  is an incomplete work in progress and I'd really like access to more glyphs.\r\n\r\nI
  really like how this type has a clean, scientific almost medicinal, sterile feel
  to it. I like how it is very geometric as well. Please if anyone has any alternatives
  to this typeface it would be awesome if you could share.\r\n\r\nExtra credit if
  you can find me one with a web-font alternate as well.\r\n\r\nYou can find Acid
  here:\r\n\r\nhttp://26plus-zeichen.de/fonts/acid-type/\r\n\r\nThanks for the help![img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts-148_6058.jpg]"
