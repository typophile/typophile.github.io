    many others. Perhaps it means eating the squab is something your mouth will enjoy
    as in \"thanks to your mouth for allowing you to eat squab.\"\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS:

    just got back to NJ from DC. Both are too darned hot, but most buildings in DC
    are nicely air-conditioned. In fact, at the National Museum of the American Indian,
    it was too cold!\r\n"

  body: The difference between NY and DC is that DC apartments actually have central
    air, you're lucky to find one of those places here in New York. The coolest room
    in my apartment reads 80 degrees, and that's WITH the AC blowing. San Fran is
    looking better every day. :)
