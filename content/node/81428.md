body: "Hi all, I'm trying to identify some of the typography used in John Carpenter's
  sci-fi classic, They Live. The following site has some really good examples of the
  typography used in the movie:\r\n\r\nhttp://annyas.com/this-is-your-god-typography-they-live-1988/\r\n\r\nThere
  are obviously a couple of different weights and style in use, (possibly completely
  different fonts) but the two main fonts I want to identify is the one in the top
  'Obey' image and the other on the 'Do not question authority' image.\r\n\r\nI thought
  the font in the Obey image looked like Century Gothic Bold or Gill Sans Bold but
  there are some slight differences.\r\n\r\nAnybody got any ideas?"

    for the text on the OBEY sign.
