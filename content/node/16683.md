    rest of the pages on this site are worth reading.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, different
    languages are covered by different species of the ISO 8859 standard. And there
    is some overlap. In fact, you could any of the 8859 species to set English, since
    English -- in contemporary usage -- requires no accents.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what
    you mean by Single-byte and Multibyte, but am assuming that \"Single-byte\" means
    8-bit. 8-bit fonts have a maximum of 256 characters, not all of which are accessible.
    On the other hand, Unicode fonts, of which OpenType is the prevalent format, are
    extended 16-bit."
