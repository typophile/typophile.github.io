  marks on a temporary basis from the keyboard in order to insert inch and foot marks?  <BR>
  <BR>I realize that I can just insert them from the Type &#62; Insert Glyphs... palette.
  But how tedious and clumsy is that?! In Quark &#40;Mac&#41; I could just use the
  control modifier key and type either control-&#39; for a foot prime or shift-control-&#39;
  for an inch double prime. <BR> <BR>Anything like this in InDD? <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

  body: Thanks, John. I&#39;ll give it a try next time. Still not as elegant as the
    option in Quark, but better than mousing through the Insert Glyphs.  <BR> <BR>--

  body: '...but it&#39;s more elegant if the primes given using Cmd-Shft-&#39; were
    actually &#34;dumb quotes&#34; and not the primes designed with the font.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;ve never noticed this to be the case, nor do I know much about whether
    designed primes are standard in a font or not. <BR> <BR>&#62; better than mousing
    through the Insert Glyphs <BR> <BR>Maybe somebody could write a script to do this
    with a keystroke.  :^&#41;'

  body: Hi Kent, <BR>I believe this is what you a looking for... <BR>ShiftOptionApple
    &#39;   <BR>Once you&#39;ve hit this key command nothing appears to happen...what
    you don&#39;t see is that it has made the switch to primes/or glyphs depending
    on what your default is set at. Now hit &#39; and you&#39;ll see the change. <BR>
    <BR>Let me know if you have any problems. <BR> <BR>Chris  <BR>
