  and im sure the answers will very but what the hell.\r\n\r\nI'm a filmmaker and
  type-nut (though im not where as good as most of you). Since I'm such a nerd I always
  like to make sure my type is historically accurate, at least as of late. \r\n\r\nProblem
  is it's tough to know exactly what are the best fonts to use from each time period.
  So I thought why not create a short list of the quintessential font(s) of the last
  few decades? That way if someone wants to make sure their type is historically accurate
  but doesn't want to do a tonne of research they can quickly glance at the list and
  use one of the suggestions.\r\n\r\nSo what would you say? What are the quintessential
  fonts of certain decades?\r\n\r\nObviously this is a matter of opinion and no easy
  question but it still might be fun to get a ballpark idea. \r\n\r\nAlso we're not
  necessarily looking for fonts that were simply DESIGNED during that decade, but
  ones that were around and preferably in use/fairly common for the era.\r\n\r\nSo
  while Helvetica was around in the 50's, it didn't really make its big breakout until
  the late 60s/Early 70s (if my memory of \"Helvetica\" the documentary is correct...
  which it probably isn't). That means we'd probably list it in 60s/70s rather than
  50s.\r\n\r\nI dont know, maybe this is only something myself and Mark Simonson give
  a crap about. All I know is these titles for this pseudo documentary that takes
  place in 2006 but tells this history of a school dating back to 1956 is FRUSTRATING.
  I dont know which way to go... argh. "

    you narrowed your search down to a certain decade or period, like the 60s or 90s.
    It's very difficult to define a decade by a typeface. Helvetica probably fits
    everything from the 60s until today. Then there are typefaces that fit to a certain
    art/music history period (like art-deco, pop art, psychedelic music) and will
    mostly be used only when referring to this specific period. As I'm a kid of the
    80s and 90s, it's pretty hard to judge anything before that time, so I'll stick
    to what I know (well, sort of):\r\n\r\n'Typefaces' of the 80's (in no particular
    order)\r\n- LCD\r\n- Squared typefaces (like Machine)\r\n- [[http://www.racketboy.com/images/asteroids-box.jpg|Rounded
    Atari typeface]]\r\n- [[http://www.mantripping.com/images/stories/back-to-the-future.jpg|Back
    to the Future]]\r\n- Helveticanisms for everything serious and grown up... ;-)\r\n\r\n'Typefaces'
    of the 90's (in no particular order)\r\n- Comic Sans/Arial \r\n- Impact\r\n- Pixel
    typefaces\r\n- Techno typefaces\r\n- Everything stretched and bent, blurred and
    embossed beyond recognition\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

    era?

  body: "Hi Adam...\r\n\r\nI've found that it is much easier to point out when a typeface
    is used anachronistically in a film than it is to say what <em>would</em> be appropriate.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I would suggest doing some research at a library or somewhere you can look
    at magazines, advertising or books from the period in question. Another good resource
    for this kind of thing is the Taschen \"All-American Ads\" book series (assuming
    you're looking for North American examples). Once you've got some examples of
    period typography that you like or would like to emulate, it's just a matter of
    identifying the typefaces. If you need help identifying typefaces, resources like
    Typophile's Type ID Board can come be handy."

    catalog.\r\nSo for type, look to ads in Macleans or Chatelaine from the appropriate
    era, or Art Directors Club annuals.\r\nBut if your film is more niche, check out
    niche publications.\r\n\r\nAlso have a strategy for temporal span: not every car
    on the street in any given year is a late model, but you have to decide how aggressive
    the mise-en-sc\xE8ne is in locating the action at a particular point in time.

  body: With the 90s, you may have to specify which half you're looking at. The early-mid
    90s was all about grunge fonts and early Emigre stuff (Matrix, Bodega, etc.),
    and in the late 90s, once the web became prominent, things seemed to shift more
    towards cleaner and/or more "techno" fonts.

    kill me. That or I could just re-watch Mad Men haha.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm thinking
    I may use Neutraface. I know technically it wasn't around in the 50s but its got
    a nice feel to it, and is absolutely beautiful."

    tended to be either pretty plain with all the creative energy channeled into hand-lettered
    display scripts. Some possibilities: \r\n\r\nGenerously spaced Futura or Trade
    Gothic caps\r\nWide sans serifs like Venus Extended\r\n\r\nFor hand lettering,
    House's Ed Gothic, Ed Script or Ed Roman would be pitch-perfect. Other possibilities
    would be Dom Casual, Balloon, Flash, or Murray Hill."

    trying to think of a serif that might work... I'd be really nice if it matched
