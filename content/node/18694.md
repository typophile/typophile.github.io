body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI really like the font used on Bite Communications' website
  for their headers but I am not actually sure what it is.  I dont know why, but the
  Caps remind me of a rounded Blender... \r\n\r\nLink here: http://www.bitepr.com/images/headings/top1_home.gif\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help in advance guys, and if you could recommend similar fonts I would
  be very grateful!"

      told me it was Mr. Guicco or something...\r\n\r\nCould anyone recommend fonts
      in the same vein? (I am familiar with Foundry Gridnik and Blender, but they
      seem far too angular)\r\n\r\nYes Interstate is similar to what I am looking
      for :)"
