		<div class="commentbody">vudutu,

Glad to see your a Master Juggler fan. I've tried all of the font managers and I like MJ the best. To me it works very much like the old ATM Deluxe that had so many fans back in pre-X days.

I think MJ's biggest advantage is not building its own database of the fonts. It just turns them on and off, anywhere they are located, and it doesn't have to be running all the time. Launch, active your fonts, quit. It does lack an auto-activation, but I was told by Alsoft that that would be in an upgrade. I fear that the upgrade may be a long wait since MJ is definitly a cult font manager at this point.

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah I just switched to FontExplorerX for the last few days to give it a try. So far I have no complaints, I find it activated my fonts much quicker than Suitcase and I really like the way the interface is setup and organize my types. Also like the preview area better than in suitcase and seems to integrate with Indesign quite well.

Is this only free now because it is still beta or is the goal to always keep it free?</div>

I'm not sure when (at which upgrade point) it started to balk, but it no longer auto-activates fonts. I loved that feature and it was a dream for years. It has become a nightmare however and it's time to change.

I was floundering on OS X until Linotype Font Explorer X came out. The only thing I miss in it over Font Reserve is the ability to print sample sheets in various configurations. It is much more stable and has far better sorting options. I've heard some bad things about the latest update, though, so I'm hesitating to install it until the next patch comes in.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Linotype Font Explorer was just updated on July 10; maybe the doubters can give it another try. I've been loving it; it works the way I want a font manager to do. I don't like the ones that make their own secret copy of things or move my data around. FontExplorer adds some iTunes-like features, like making new sets from any fonts already activated or added.

I use font managers to test fonts in development, so my usage is probably different from that of most graphic designers, but the convenience of activation is the big hook for me, and that's useful to anyone with a lot of fonts they don't want installed permanently. </div>

House Industries could probably remedy that....   ;)  Can sound files be embedded in a font? MusicType? </div>

Three years of posts on this subject and there's nothing close to a consensus.

Great. I deal mainly in CS2 apps on my Imac G5. I'm trying to use Font Book to run my fonts from an external hard drive but it absolutely chokes when I try to feed it my entire library.

It will simply open and show no fonts at all.

I know there must be an objective 'best' out there, but if we can't figure it out on Typophile.com then where in the world will we?!
