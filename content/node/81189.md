body: Curious if these two typefaces can be identified, or are original designs? Found
  on old Polish book cover. Closest match I've found to "botanika" is Neo Sans Ultra,
  but there are clear differences. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/botanika_kozlowska_6124.jpg]

    in Warsaw.\r\nAfter World War II the Foundry operated under the name Odlewnia
    Czcionek."
