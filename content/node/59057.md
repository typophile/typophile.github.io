    reasons, besides the spec you referenced, why I shouldn't manually change IDs

  body: "Given that the specification deals with the string \"Regular\" in a special
    way, overriding this behavior by post-processing the font using \"ttx\" may have
    consequences.\r\n\r\nThere is no harm in experimenting, which should include a
    heavy dose of application testing, to make sure that the \"Regular\" weight of
    the font appears correctly in the font menus, and otherwise behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nIf
    you don't mind a suggestion, one thing to consider is the use of one- and two-letter
    abbreviations for the weight names, such as EL, L, R, M, B, and H for Extra Light,
    Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, and Heavy.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior Computer

  body: "Jackson: '[...] This rule seems a little arbitrary and I don\u2019t like
    the inconsistency [...]'\r\n\r\nI don't think the rule is either arbitrary or
    inconsistent. As you can read in the specs, with exception of the CFF entry for
    the Windows platform, the <em>Full font name</em> is made of the <em>Font Family
    name</em> + <em>Font Subfamily name</em>. If a typeface has more than four weights/styles,
    the fact that a family on the Windows side can't contain more than four 'MacStyles'
    (fsSelection) will force one to put for instance the Light, Medium, Black or whatever
    weight into a separate family. So, the <em>Font Family name</em> could very well
    in that case contain a weight indicator then and adding 'Regular' to it in the
    <em>Full font name</em> for the fsSelection: 64 would be the undesirable result
    of your consistency rule.\r\n\r\nFor validating the Naming Table the <em>Consistency
    Checker</em> of <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/english/demo.html\">DTL OTMaster
    (Light)</a> is a helpful tool, I reckon.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nKen: '[...] There
    is no harm in experimenting [...]'\r\n\r\nNo, there isn't, but, as you will agree,
    the nice thing of specs is that following these will at least theoretically assure
    one of a proper behavior of one's fonts. If they don't, one can blame the application
    in question or even the operating system. \r\n\r\nThe rules for the OpenType Naming
    Table are mostly pretty old anyway, because the format is an enhancement of the
    TrueType format, of course.\r\n"

  body: "Jackson: \u2018[...] I could change the style name from \u201CRegular\u201D
    to \u201CBook\u201D and the name tables would be built differently [...]'\r\n\r\nThat
    is according to the specs still. As you know, on the Mac side you can theoretically
    have an unlimited number of Font Subfamilies (which used as such, is not always
    an advantage for the end user, but that is another discussion). On the Windows
    side there is a maximum of four because a Font Family can't contain more than
    four different styles. \r\n\r\nUsing \u2018Book\u2019 as a Subfamily on the Windows
    side is not incorrect as such, but personally I prefer to let the Font Subfamily
    name correspond with the fsSelection setting and then the specs make sense.\r\nNot
    every Windows app shows the Subfamily name, and in my opinion the style information,
    for instance \u2018Regular\u2019, could be confusing when the actual Subfamily
    is \u2018Book\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe escape route for the more advanced apps is offered
    by the naming entries for PlatformID 3 (Windows), NameID 16 (Preferred Family)
    and 17 (Preferred Subfamily), which I would use for equaling PlatformID 1 (Mac
    OS), NameID 1 (Font Family name) and 2 (Font Subfamily name).\r\n"

  body: "As you probably know, an adapted version of the AFDKO is under the hood of
    DTL FontMaster. So, perhaps it might be interesting to know how the font naming
    is controlled in FM.\r\n\r\nThe file structure of FM is based on the 35 years
    old IKARUS system (we celebrate this fact at the FM conference in the <a href=\"http://www.kurhaus.nl\">Kurhaus
    hotel</a> in the Hague coming autumn. Besides the \u2018central\u2019 Character
    Layout file(s) (for character names, Unicode code points and encoding vectors)
    and OT Layout features file(s), there are four different font files: a glyph database
    file (BE or IK), the kerning file (AFM or .fea), the font metrics info/naming
    file (UFM) and a file that contains certain parameters like for instance the blue
    values (PAR). The files are connected with each other by the file names.\r\n\r\nI
    have attached an example of the UFM file below. It is just a text file that contains
    font info such as naming. The \u2018TTName\u2019 entries are specifically used
    for the TrueType and OpenType production and are supplemental to, or supersede
    related info in the rest of the file.\r\n\r\nWhen exporting OpenType fonts all
    required conversions are done in a temporary directory, where all files needed
    by the conversion tools involved are created or copied. For instance <em>feathead.txt</em>,
    <em>featname.txt</em>, and <em>featos2.txt</em> contain table blocks for respectively
    the \u2018head\u2019, \u2018name and \u2018OS/2\u2019 table, with all entries
    based on the UFM and PAR files. Name IDs from <em>featname.txt</em> are in the
    range of 1\u20136 (the standard range). The original <em>Adobe Hatch OpenType</em>
    tool (HOT) will not take these names from a features file, but the modified HOT
    tool (by URW++) will accept any ID.\r\n\r\nThe main concern of every font producer
    is <strong>reproducibility</strong> and <strong>consistency</strong> throughout
    a type library. Font data must be easy to edit and update. The fact that the UFM
    file is an editable and duplicatable text file, makes it easy to re-use it for
    variants of font weights/styles, for instance for other scripts. \r\nI have made
    simple Apple scripts that rename a couple of entries like \u2022indicator\u2022
    (for instance TOT for the text version of an OpenType Standard font, or TPRO for
    the OpenType Pro version) and \u2022UniqueID\u2022 and some other font specific
    entries, and subsequently distribute the UFM files to a static system of directories
    for the actual font production, where the four font files for the different scripts
    reside (Character Layout files and OT Layout features files are \u2018globally\u2019
    used).\r\nThe glyph database files in these directories are renamed copies of
    \u2018central\u2019 glyph databases, of which file-renamed copies are re-distributed
    over the system after updates using Apple scripts also. The generation of the
    actual fonts is handled by a \u2018pyramid\u2019 like structure of command files
    that relate to the static directory system.\r\n\r\nWith the future in mind, it
    has taken me some time to organize the production at DTL as described. For quite
    some years now we are working on WGL4 character sets for all fonts and the copying/distributing
    system makes it easier to generate (and control!) all font variants that contain
    subsets.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStartFontMetrics\r\nTTName
