body: "Hi all:\r\n\r\nHere is a sign application that I'm wondering how to match.
  It's clearly a Futura-inspired face, or simply a different cut of the face than
  the current Adobe \"Futura Std\" OpenType version I have. But, I'm not sure.....any
  Futura history specialists out there?\r\n\r\nHere is the sign with the Adobe Futura
  as a pink overlay. You can see that the \"3\" and \"S\" are more open in aperture
  in the signage version, the periods are also rectangular instead of round, and the
  probably most telling, the leg of the \"R\" doesn't connect the bowl right at the
  stem intersection...it starts further down the bowl.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SiskEntrySign_withOverlay_4092.jpg]"

  body: I'm definitely no Futura expert, but thought I'd respond. From what I understand,
    these letters come from a draftsman/architectural perspective. The Gotham typeface
    was derived from an exploration of these letterforms. Many of these characters
    are similar to Gotham, but single-join of the K is different. So, since these
    letterforms were often designed by draftsmen, you may not find an exact match.
    You might also want to look at Nobel and Agenda.

    Although, your sample definitely looks more Futura-ish.\r\n\r\nCan't seem to add
    a link. Go to www.typography.com go to Gotham/History."
