  body: "Back in 2000 when first discovered the internet, signing up for email accounts
    etc was a nightmare as every iteration of \"chris\" was taken. I stumbled upon
    \"onemore\" then, I use it for most things. Also \"more\" was my first word so
    it seemed fitting.\r\n\r\nMy current portfolio is a little impersonal and cold
    right now (onemorechris.co.uk) . Since I made it, I've had a fair bit of feed
    back from employees and clients about it, some know everything, others understand/appreciate
    very little. So I'm taking a different route, making a more personal and warmer.
    \r\n\r\nI watched the film about helvetica and got fired up about type again,
    although I know very little. The straight forwardness of the words made me want
    to focus on font and colour and nothing more. So im looking for input from some
    people who know more about type than I do. \r\n\r\nDo you mean \"loosening\" as
    space between letters and thickness?\r\nThanks for the comment"

  body: "loosening here refers to the space between the letters\r\n\r\nI had a glance
    at your site and I feel that helvetica may be too impersonal and cold for the
    impression I get from you - you seem like a lively and creative guy, and I find
    Helvetica to be faceless and ubiquitous to express that warmth.\r\n\r\nI'd like
    to see more ideas here, I think there's a great solution out there waiting and
    I don't think you're far off from it.\r\n\r\nOn a slightly different note, I visited
    your site and I found the captions impossible to read :-(  I'm using Flash 10
    in Firefox developer build on a Mac (oh so many things that could be messing it
    up eh?)\r\n\r\nThis is how I see it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oops_4455.png]"

    deal with areas of text differently. What I have in the works will see this all
    go. Thanks for the pointer. \r\nI will put the next set up here as it happens.
    Your comments are very useful. thank you for your time.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a strategy first.\r\n\r\nTell us here what you are trying to accomplish with your

    sum up your logo in 3 words, what would they be?\r\n\r\n\r\nI think if you approach
    the <em>problem</em> of creating a logo to represent yourself as a problem that
    needs a <em>solution</em>, you need a <em>rationale</em> and a plan on what process
    you intend to use to find that solution.\r\n\r\nGive us a strategic brief of the

  body: "(Its strange that when you do work for yourself, all normal practices are
    forgotten.) My problem is my current site is impersonal and clinical. I need something
    that better illustrates who I am to clients and people I collaborate with.  I
    want a logo that is personal and warm to illustrate that I am a person and not
    a company. So who I am and what I do are the part of the same thing, and thats
    what you will be hiring. \r\nwords: personal, trust, warn, driven, versatile \r\nHa,
    i don't hate you. I dont know anyone who is good with type and its always good
    to get some feedback from someone\r\n\r\nTake a look at some of these.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/onemorechrisLogo4-10_6089.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    dont think any of these is a final idea, the whole paint thing is prob a little
    over done and a bit 2006 but you see where I going with it?"

    that it would probably work if you just set \"One more Chris.\" in a typeface
    of your choice. I don't think you need to cram all of the words together and make
    everything lowercase.\r\n\r\nIf you really feel the need, I'd do one or the other,

    are used for the new portfolio site but will change for invoices etc that don't
    have a brown background.\r\nwhen the site is done I'll post a link on here. I'd
    still like to here what you think about the logo.\r\nThanks again for your input.\r\n\r\nChris"
