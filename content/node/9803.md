  body: There was a NovelFonts typeface from the 1994 Expresiv Ornate Font Collection
    called &#39;Carolissa&#39; that looks like the medium weight of whatever font
    this is &#40;see below&#41;. Of course, those fonts did not use the original names,
    and my notes mention a resemblance to Technotyp &#40;p.215 in Jaspert&#39;s &#39;Encyclopaedia
    of Type Faces&#39;&#41;, although neither &#39;Carolissa&#39; nor Technotyp show
    the flat-bottom &#39;d&#39;. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67520.gif"

  body: 'Here is another attempt to sim this with Carolissa, using Illustrator to
    thicken the stroke by 4 pts, and flatten the type to 80% height. A little playing
    with the &#39;d&#39; to make it closer, with a black rectangle along the stem,
    and a white one to flatten the base. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/67523.gif"

  body: Evan, can you tell us where the sample was from? It&#39;s useful to know if
    this was done in the pre-digital days or more recently.

  body: Except for the flat bottom on the d, this looks almost exactly like an old
    Headliners face called Cardiff. You might check with Joe Treacy at Treacyfaces/Headliners
    &#40; <a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com" target="_blank">http://www.treacyfaces.com</a>
    &#41;. Treacyfaces aquired the rights to the old Headliners type library a while
    ago. Some of the old Headliners faces have been digitized, but not Cardiff as
    far as I know.
