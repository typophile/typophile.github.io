I know it would be helpful to have some more glyphs to show, but my concentration is consumed for today and I am curious about whether you think this has some direction or no direction at all.

Thank you for your time!

Here are some comments, take them with a grain of salt:
- /t/ is top-heavy.
- The ear on /r/ should be a tad heavier.
- The transition/arch on the letters /m/n/h/u/ should be slightly darker. Also the top-right on /a/ and /p/.
- /x/ is probably too wide at the bottom.
- /k/ seems a bit odd with the upper diagonal thicker than the bottom.

In any case, the joins on your letters are lovely. I especially like your serifs - my attempt at similar ones didn't work too well. Also, as far as the /t/ goes, the lowercase t is the worst letter to design in my opinion. Normally you form it using the left part of the /u/, and figure the crossbar weight from the eye of the /e/.

I am guessing you can find most of the problems yourself. Printing a page in your font at a small size should help you find any major problems, as this will be used in small sizes.

Hope that helps! If you have time, you could take a look at <a href="http://typophile.com/node/68311">my font</a>. C:</div>

Lowercase c, a and f have no serifs on their terminal strokes and I quite like it. I've put a serif on the uppercase C to make a comparison. Your great feedback is warmly welcomed!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, as has been said before, I'm just a beginner so take what I say with a grain of salt.

This is looking pretty good (nice numerals), though on some of the bowls, arches, and  round corners, the strokes don't appear to be the same thickness. Some letters, like the uppercase U, look slightly lopsided to me. (Again, thickness of bowls and arches.) Some letters are very round, and some are more square, try to equalize it.

Diagonal uppercase letters AMNWV... Try making the thin and thicks (as subtly different as they are) like so:
- A: <code>/<strong>\</strong></code>
- V: <code><strong>\</strong>/</code> (opposite of A)
- M: <code>|<strong>\</strong>/<strong>|</strong></code> (not with the inner strokes thinner)
 N: <code>|<strong>\</strong>|</code>
 W: <code><strong>\</strong>/<strong>\</strong>/</code>

Also:
- G should have a serif on it's stem
- bottom stroke of the C should extend slightly past the top stroke
- the horizontals  in your uppercase should be slightly thinner than the verticals
- lowercase g is great! Though you could try making the ear sheared off diagonally
- Maybe try connecting the bowl on the R to the stem, and making the angle of the leg slightly less.


Your uppercase might be slightly too bold compared to the lowercase, but I would print a test out on paper to make sure. Also, the spacing is much too tight for text, although it works for titling, if you plan on having it used at all for text, you might want to loosen the spacing a bit. (Graphic designers tend to close up the spacing in large sizes if they feel it's needed.)

Sorry if this is a lot of critiques, and most of my previous critiques may still apply, but I hope it helps (remember the grain of salt!). Anyway, I've been waiting for the uppercase. This font is great! (Hope you release it!)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My, now this is some constructive criticism! Where do you live? I will send you a pig for Christmas.

The basic spacing is almost done now. I've put more space between letters, as they are quite open. Yes, I'm having difficulties with the curved strokes (which basically are the font). I think I fiddle with them with just my bad eye. I should make some control shapes to help make the curves and diagonals more uniform. You are so right about the diagonals. I've improved them according to your suggestions:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uc,lc,numbers_5572.jpg]


In the first post I've attached another pdf with the current spacing. Still no kerning. Set at 9/11, I think it is not the most unreadable design when printed.

Right now I'm having trouble with the diacritical marks.

Another question comes to my mind: should I make the round curves more square, or the squarish ones more round?

I will take time tomorrow to take an in-depth look at your remarks.

Thank you so much!</div>

As far as the rounded edges go, I'd say even it out. Some letters are naturally rounder, I think, and some (with smaller counters) need to be less round to still appear squarish. The lower case is good, for the most part. I would start with the O and the check the other letters against that.</div>
