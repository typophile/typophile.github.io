  body: "Looks handdrawn to me. There are a few fonts which have been created by hand
    calligraphers, and used for letterpress invitations at [[http://www.bellafigura.com/letterpress/customize/calligraphy.html|Bella
    Figura]]. Could be one of them. Makes me also thinking to the work of [[http://neithersnow.squarespace.com/|Mara
    Zepeda]] at Neither Snow and [[http://shop.magpiepaperworks.com/|Magpie Paper
    Works]] ([[http://shop.magpiepaperworks.com/category/fonts|Vermandois and Saissant]]
    are available to buy).\r\nA list of very loosely similar: [[http://shop.magpiepaperworks.com/category/fonts|Vermandois
    and Saissant]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/betatype/dear-sarah-pro/|Dear Sarah]],

  body: thanks, I was leaning towards hand drawn but some of those "drawn" fonts do
    have alts for every character (thinking "olicana"), so I thought it maybe one
    them... thanks again
