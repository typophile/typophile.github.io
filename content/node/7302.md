body: I am a graphic designer and currently I am employed by an advertising agency
  named Kres to design a logotype for their corporation. They are a leading advertising
  company in my country and would like somewhat tycoonish look. Nevertheless, they
  have a predilection for style, like all of us.  <BR>I would like you to review this
  logotypes and come up with ideas/suggestions to strengthen  <BR>the appeal. Please
  feel free to critisize the work harshly and I am free to accept it or disregard
  it. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51887.jpg" alt="Kres

    something sleek &amp; modern like the newly released Bodebeck from Linotype...
