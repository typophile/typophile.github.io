    The \"owner\" of a script still has to take some initiative. So for example Armenia
    will have to take some steps before we can use Armenian in domain names.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I hope this doesn't cause minority-script people to avoid the rest of the web...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    still \"dot-com\" (or perhaps \"dot-kom\"). This new proposal is for the stuff
    <em>after</em> the final dot, so a better example would have been\r\n\r\n&#119;&#119;&#119;.hey-its-even-slower-than-it-was.typophile\r\n\r\n(But
    that'll set you back about $130,000.)"

    the url)? I didn't know Typophile has its own Unicode point :)

  body: "> \u0645\u0635\u0631.\r\n\r\nWow! Ah, RTL. Just got my brain in a knot. \r\nQuestion:
    Can one mix scripts in one URL \r\n(like \xABtypophile.[Arabic Egyptian TLD]\xBB?
    \r\nIf so then how does that work for combining \r\nLTR and RTL scripts? It changes
    the whole\r\nlogic of which side of a dot which parts are on."

  body: "Hrant: this reads \"msr\" in Arabic, which I presume is the 3-letter abbrev.
    for \"Mi\u1E63r\" -- the native name for Egypt. So this top level domain still
    complies to the old system \".uk\", \".de\", \".nl\" and so on.\r\n\r\nThe new
    system allows any top level domain (any one if you pay for it, that is)."
