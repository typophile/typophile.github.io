body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to find a typeface that suggests 'now' in typography,
  for use in an essay/design project which partially covers the same. The typeface
  in question will be used only for headlines, so it can be (but doesn't have to be)
  fairly chaotic or even somewhat illegible. It should be something that appeals to
  a design aesthetic, rather than strict functionality... something like the 2007
  equivalent of Dead History or the like. This project is still in the semi-conceptual
  phase, so a wide range of stuff would be good. Cheers.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks Stephen. Some beautiful work indeed. I'm especially fond of Absara-
    what a family. I think these are maybe a bit too "friendly" for my purposes, but
    they're definitely along the lines of what I'm looking for in terms of feeling
    contemporary.

    gorgeous. Wild and damaged is over, immaculate and fabulous is in. I think Stephen
    called it when he suggested Xavier Dupr\xE9 as representative of type design now."

  body: "jpad,\r\nMostly I tend to agree, especially if we are talking about Type
    with a capital T, but with this project I am attempting to look into how type
    interfaces with society on the level of everyday life, and Dupr\xE9's work just
    isn't communicating that to me, if that makes any sense. To me, \"legible, rational,
    and gorgeous\" is more about how designers perceive design and not how it is experienced
    in the real world. Of course, what a typeface represents also depends on how it
    is used, so something pristine and beautiful may be still be suitable; I'm just
    not sure yet.\r\n\r\nI apologize for being so deliberately vague, but I think
    this is one of those \"I'll know what I'm after when I see it\" situations. Further
    suggestions would be very welcome."

  body: Thanks people. Gotham was actually one of my first thoughts, especially as
    it is so ubiquitous today. I am considering some of the Sudtipos fonts as well,
    although not the scripts as I don't think they're well suited for the layouts
    I have in mind. The search continues, but you've given me some good direction.

  body: "William,\r\n\r\nNice! Definitely under consideration.\r\n\r\nStephen,\r\n\r\nSure.
    The project will be a series of 6\u02BA\xD79\u02BA pages, composed as spreads
    (probably about 20\u201325 pages in total). The left side of each spread will
    be composed of illustrations, typographic compositions, and photographs, sometimes
    with captions relating them to the main text. Each of these pages will also have
    a one-word identifier which ties it into the text in some way. This is the largest
    typographic element, at about 24pt, and is where the typeface in question will
    likely be used. Right now I'm using Franklin Gothic Condensed for the captions-
    which can change, however the way the captions and layouts are set up, they tend
    to have a significant vertical emphasis, so I think it might be good to have the
    larger type contrast with that by being wide or rounded.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand
    side of each spread will contain the actual text, and is set up in a very old-school
    way, with classical proportions. Right now this is set with Sabon, which I feel
    pretty comfortable with. The text itself deals with a number of issues. Some concepts
    which I feel are relevant to type selection are the idea that we simultaneously
    parse a number of typographic styles at any given point in time (and are getting
    much more adept at doing so), and the idea that type reflects culture and can
    do so either on an honest, historical level or in a contrived, imagined-by-the-designer
    kind of way, and that these two are not always mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nAs is
    probably obvious by now, this is a student project, and my budget is fairly limited,
    so it would be nice to license something which has the side benefit of being useful
    in the future. The selection of fonts available at the school is fairly good,
    but they don't have anything truly contemporary."
