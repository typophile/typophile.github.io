  think the body text is nearly [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bodoni-antiqua/t-regular-condensed-italic/|this]]
  but its not quite right.\r\n\r\nAny help with the Egyptian style font would be much
  appreciated.\r\nSample is attached too.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_simon_5941.jpg]"
