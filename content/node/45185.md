    tools have their weaknesses, starting with their databases and then the coding.

    cropping your image so that all characters are on <em>one</em> line and are either
    positive <em>or</em> negative will help WTF to give the correct answer:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wtf_3912.png]"

    WTF would have been capable of coming up with the right answer. Yes, it\u2019s
    a stupid machine, you have to know how to feed it.\r\nF"

  body: "Yes, it was a good point about tailoring the image to fit the tool. It also
    shows another tool limitation that doesn't bother a human. I'm really not trying
    to prolong an argument, because I think we are in agreement, but I often hear
    newcomers talk about these tools as if they are all you need to ID fonts. My comments
    were mostly to illustrate why that approach is often frustrating.\r\n\r\n- Mike
