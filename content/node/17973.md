  1975. I know I've seen this face, in fact I know I have it, but I still haven't
  recovered from the OSX install font file relocation disaster.\r\n\r\nWe've ruled
  out bank gothic. Thanks!"

  body: Whoa. That graphic is really, really, really too small. Can you post a bigger
    image? If we can't read the type, we won't be able to identify it.

  body: "you guys are totally right about the teeny size. but that's really the only
    decent sample we can dig up. i apologize.\r\n\r\nwhatever typeface it is, it was
    commonly used from the 50s to 70s in the US. i've seen it on a lot of old print
    work, doors and signage from the era. uniform thickness in stroke, non-angled
    terminals, generally identical lengths for arms. if anyone has some hunches, then
    it's probably the obvious.\r\n\r\nit reads \"TELEVISION FRAN\xC7AISE\".\r\n\r\nthanks
    again,\r\njaan"

    i think unless you can find a higher-rez sample, you're on your own for this one."

    for the small size, but it's an image from tv graphics, from france, from 21 years
    ago. \r\n\r\nkinda explains the lack of printed matter or 800 x 600 gifs of this
    logo floating around the internet.\r\n\r\nthanks tiffany for the eurostile tip,
    though i think it's not quite it. \r\n\r\nthanks again,\r\njaan"

    more legible.
