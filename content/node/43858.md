  body: "An exceptionally fresh and alluring family...note the roman lower case a
    and y (second line \u201Crapidly\u201D in sample below), the very crisp roman
    fi ligature (\u201Cfigures\u201D at end of 4th line), the well-judged spacing
    after the oldstyle figure for one, and especially the well-contrasted bold and
    bold italics (two bolder weights follow). The OpenType version is quite affordable
    at current sale prices (how about making those permanent??) and, God bless him,
    all the fonts are keystroke-linked! Bravo Ludwig...a distinguished debut on the
    world type stage...we\u2019re looking for more from you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Marat_6446.png]"

    in prices at My Fonts. Some of the open type fonts are 17.50 each and some are
    $42.50.  \r\n\r\nSharon"

    confusion. The $42.50 type is actually the Marat Pro Version. I will ask MyFonts
    to change this and label the Font \"Pro\".\r\n\r\nLudwig"

  body: Very nice. May I suggest a total separation of Marat Std and Marat Pro on
    MyFonts? When I tried to view Marat Std character set vs. Marat character set
    (which I assume is Pro) they were identical. If you separated the Std from the
    Pro you would eliminate all of the confusion.

    the Pro package?

  body: "Yes, that's the Pro package. Marat Std contains only the Western European
    character set. The extended Pro Version has a much larger character set, small
    caps and many additional OpenType features (see PDF).\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry for
    the confusion. I will sort this out as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nLudwig"
