  well maybe in some time i get the knowledge to make other kind of statements.\r\n\r\nWell,
  i'm looking for this font (or a similar one) to use on a work. Can anyone help?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Most of the letters by outline look to be a dead ringer for Avenir 85 Heavy.
    The K, H and S are throwing me. Possibly all modified? I'll keep my eyes peeled...

  body: Actually, even closer to Neuziet S BookHeavy. Same problem with the K and
    H but almost all the other characters are a perfect match.

  body: "Florian, because I really really needed to procrastinate, I looked through
    the whole guide - I didn't see any fonts that were close.  The \"T\" with the
    three bands across the top and then three bands down, with no \"T\" intersection,
    seems to be unusual.\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"

  body: "I agree that it's not in my Guide, and I checked the several Dover books
    I have with type like this and didn't see a match. That included the Solotype
    Catalog. It resembles Neon that someone re-drew as a Prisma-style font. I thought
    someone once described a way to fake this look in Illustrator with some sort of
    outline/offset technique, but I have no other ideas, other than check freebies
    at Dafont.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
