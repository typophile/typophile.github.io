  find how to generate a Hebrew font in FontLab. \r\n\r\nLet's say I've got all I
  need already, and I have FontLab. How do I create a Font in Hebrew? is there a Code
  Page for Hebew? How do I \"turn it on\"? \r\n\r\nI'm very new in the typograhpy
  field, so every little detail is needed and will help me. \r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Yes, there are code pages for Hebrew and any other you may wish.  Scroll through
    your list of code pages from the drop-down menu. I am not sure if they are part
    of the basic FLS install, but if not, they are available.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hebrewencoding_3781.png]

  body: "To continue on this subject. I know how to draw new characters or pull up
    the correct page for whatever language I'm doing and all that. What doesn't work
    for me is Generate font. It does produce ttf or otf file but Hebrew characters
    can't be typed if I'm in InDesign for example. English - yes, but not Hebrew.
    I added Encoding and Unicode codepage - Hebrew and Unicode ranges - Hebrew. But
    still - no go. Other languages work just fine - cyrilic, greek, etc. What am I
    missing here?\r\n\r\nMichael"
