    It's definitely a weak spot.\r\n\r\n<em>Also the diagonals of k, v, w, x would
    benefit from some tapering like it is visible in the horizontals of z. (It seems
    that there\u2019s a bit of it in the y.)</em>\r\nThere already is tapering in
    k v w x  y, though perhaps not enough for it to be clearly noticable. I'll try
    to improve that too.\r\n\r\n<em>And could you try something else with the dots
    than pure circles?</em>\r\nI could, but I won't. As far as I know tittles are
    an often discussed issue, which signifies it's relation to personal preference.
    I tried several different kinds of tittles, but I chose the cleanest, simplest
    ones. \r\n\r\n<em>Have a look at your terminals of a, c and s!</em>\r\nI can assure
    you I have had a look at them more than once, but they don't look 'wrong' to me.
    They are based on the terminals in Sensato A (visible in the sans-serif secion
    on typophile). Do you have a more concrete suggestion about what to do with the
    terminals?\r\n"

    ending determination to create perfection. \r\n\r\nIt's not as much work as it
    may seem. Where I would normally design 6 styles (regular, light, black +italics)
    I will now have to do that twice (12 styles total) and interpolation does all
    the rest. The complete Sensato family (Sensato Serif not included) will have 5
    grades, with \xB118 styles (6 weights, + italics + smallcaps). That means I get
    a typefamily of 90 styles, while I have only designed 12. Now that's the power
    of multiple master! \r\n\r\nI'm not giving myself a deadline, but I feel like
    this could be done within one or two (probably two) years from now. In the past
    I've proven to be able to work that long on one type-family. It's worth it."

  body: "Gorgeous stuff!\r\n\r\nI'm wondering a little bit about the /f/. There may
    be a danger with this type style of it looking horizontally stretched, which of
    course you're largely avoiding admirably, but my gut instinct (I'm a sometime
    newspaper designer and see fairly much badly stretched type) was that when I first
    glanced at the /f/ it felt just that, horizontally stretched. Unbalanced, that
    is, in horizontal to vertical proportion. I realise with the large x-height it
    may be difficult to get the f feeling less squatted, but would it break the style
    completely to have the ascender curve further away?"

    were external curves? Some of them are very parabolic.\r\n\r\nThe bowl on the
    /a/ could be marginally deeper.\r\n\r\n/d/ and /u/ foot/stem not consistent with

    still bothering me. They are clunky, and the higher the grade, the more clunky
    they look. Can they be more consistent with the /r/?\r\n\r\nThe bend on the tail
    of the /y/ still looks to sharp, especially in this grade.\r\n\r\nThe period looks
    a little large.\r\n\r\nNot sure about the thin ends of the /k/ and /x/ being horizontal.
    If you are giving the ends of the /v/, /w/ and /y/ an angle then surely the /k/
    and the /x/ should have more of an angle logically (or at least the same)? Isn't
    the point that you're trying to get rid of sharp angles?\r\n\r\nAgree with Johan,
    /f/ is a bit weak at the moment. Agree it could have a larger sweep to the right.\r\n\r\nGood

  body: I get what you mean. I think it would not damage the style as much as the
    color. If I do what you suggest, the terminal will become too small. Although
    it's perhaps not 'the perfect f' I like the way the top seems to pull the stem
    towards te right. This is also one of the things I love in Tierra Nueva.

  body: "Oops. My latest comment was directed at Birdseeding.\r\n\r\n@Nick: I'm not
    sure what you mean with parabloc curves. I think you mean the inside curves in
    a d b c etc. look too 'steep', right? If you look at other high-contrast typefaces
    (eg. Didot) you'll notice they have a similar curve on the inside. I will try
    to make the curves a little smoother though, but this means I'll probably also
    have to make them a bit more square (extreme).\r\n\r\nYou're right about a, I'll
    work on that.\r\n\r\nd and u foots are different from the rest because they point
    down, while 'the rest' points up. I tried to make them the way I made 'the rest',
    but it just doesn't look good. Hence the small inconsistencie. Nota, by Typonine,
    has a similar construction.\r\n\r\nThe tail of e is based on the tail of e in
    Sensato A. I'll have another look at the e in both Sensato A and E.\r\n\r\nI'm
    afraid I can't do much about the terminals. The terminal of r has a much easier
    angle and more horizontal space.\r\n\r\nI'll try to improve on the y\r\n\r\nI
    noticed the period is slightly large, but decided to leave that untill I'm satisfied
    with the lowercase.\r\n\r\nI'll change k and x.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I didn't understand
    Johan correctly. It seemd to me as if he suggested to compress the very top (not
    the terminal, but the part before that) towards the right. I will try your suggestion
    Nick, though I'm quite fond of this f.\r\n\r\nGreat feedback! Working on it.\r\n\r\nI

  body: "Hi Jasper. That's looking nice. \r\n\r\nI think you have some consistency
    conflict to resolve around the upper counters of the /B/ and /R/. If you like
    what the /B/ does, make the /R/ do a similar thing. On the /B/ and /R/ topic,
    you will not need as much overshoot to the tops (and bottom of the /B/) as in,
    for example, the /O/.\r\n\r\nThe terminals are better but I would love to see
    them come to a point rather than be clipped. I know you said you tried it, but
    I wouldn't mind if they were slightly deeper and the curve into them was less
    parabolic (squarer?) from the upper internal extremum towards the terminal itself.
    In this regard, I think the /r/ and /y/ terminals are strong and confident, the
    terminals in /a/, /c/, /s/ etc. still don't appear resolved or harmonious with
    the rest of the design.\r\n\r\nSecond stroke of the /M/ (top left to bottom middle)
    looks thinner at top than at the bottom. Because it's a central stroke you can
    get away with parallel contours here, roughly speaking.\r\n\r\nCompare the top
    left of the /M/ to the top left of the /N/. I'd suggest the /N/ is too thick on
    the uppermost horizontal contour. You may want to slant the second stroke less
    making the top look more like the /N/. Bottom middle of /M/ could also be less
    wide at the cut (on the baseline).\r\n\r\nN"

    I think I will alter both a bit so that they become more consistent looking. B
    and R already have a much smaller overshoot than O.\r\n\r\nI will upload a picture,
    showing your suggestion for the terminal and my choice. Your suggestion results
    in a rather sharp terminal. Perhaps I should alter the terminals in r and y, more
    towards a c f s.\r\n\r\nI'll change the middle strokes in M and review the relation
    between M and N.\r\n\r\nThanks Nick!"

    make a high contrast sans look natural without the contrast within stems. What

    slightly more super-ellipsoidal. I think the thickness may be thick enough but
    it doesn't stay thick for long enough through the curved strokes.\r\n\r\nThe latest
    terminal is fine in the E grade but I think it's going to cause trouble at the
    A grade end. And of course, it's your call to make. I think it could go more toward
    no.1 and as you already know I'm not averse to no.2.\r\n\r\nNo.1 is lush. Plus,
    do anything Nick C. says! (Or have a look at his lovely fonts, and then do anything
