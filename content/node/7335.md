  i&#39;m working on. card dimensions: 2.5x3.5 in. <BR> <BR>i need help finding fonts
  that stylistically match the following graphics, keeping in mind that final output
  will be quite small in footprint. <BR> <BR>of important note, is my fruitless search
  for flourishes that will get me anywhere near those shown below. <BR> <BR>can anyone
  make any suggestions? can anyone create one if there are no stock alternatives,
  in an hour or two? <BR> <BR>the following graphics are only similar in spirit. i&#39;m
  going to take the graphics of the vertical graphic and the text info from the horizonal
  version to create my own graphic. <BR> <BR>this is just for a prototype version
  of the card game, so i&#39;m not concerned with polish. just something convincing
  enought to evoke idea of a certificate. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/52043.jpg"

  body: For a nice fancy script, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-edwardian-script/">ITC
    Edwardian Script</a> is always good.  It looks alot like the face in the first
    diploma.  The &#34;University of Kerala&#34; face is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/park-avenue/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=University+Of+Kerala">Park
    Avenue</a>, kerned out of course.  For some other options, try DaFont&#39;s library
    of <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/theme.php?cat=601">calligraphy fonts</a>.

  body: ryan, thanks for your help. i&#39;ve looked through DaFonts and there are
    several specimens that might work. i&#39;d really like to use Ed Script, but it&#39;s
    x-height is just too low for the point size i&#39;ll have to use for final output.
    <BR> <BR>i&#39;ll keep looking for soemthing that looks like the script in the
    horizontal graphic. <BR> <BR>park ave looks good though. thanks!

    hopefully help you out with that first font.
