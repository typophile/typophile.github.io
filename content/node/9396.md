  thought I&#39;d request an ID on another movie title font that&#39;s been bugging
  me. <BR> <BR>This is the font for the movie now &#40;wouldn&#39;t mind having this
  IDed as well if possible, thanks&#41;: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65965.jpg"
  alt="Current Font"> <BR> <BR>But, this one is the original font used on teaser posters
  and the like. It was not used in the final promotion of the release. I think it
  was something to do with the font being too middle-eastern looking, and the film
  being released shortly after 9/11. This is the font that&#39;s been bugging me and
  I will be absolutely stoked if anyone can ID it. &#40;&#42;stoked&#42; being an
  Australian slang term - in other words, I&#39;ll be pretty pleased&#41;. <BR><img

  <BR> <BR>Any help in identifying these fonts would be greatly appreciated. Thank
  you!'

  body: James, no adding new IDs in original posts, you naughty boy! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
    border=0> <BR>You must make new posts for each subsequent ID - Dav has  <BR>dibs
    on the Ondine ID.

  body: I posted the Trajan ID, edited my post to add Ondine but had to verify it
    was Ondine before I posted it. By the time my edit was complete. Dav&#40;id&#41;
    had already posted. I did not go back and add Ondine after Dav&#40;id&#41; had
    posted. My ethics are slightly better than that. Cheers <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Thanks guys! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m amazed at how fast you guys can recognize fonts!
    I know nothing about recognizing them. I consider the people who can ID a font
    instantly as some sort of hybrid. Human-slash-FontGods. How do you guys do it?
    Is there a special Font ID school or something? lol. <BR> <BR>Anyway, thanks a
    bunch!
