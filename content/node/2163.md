  Is nobody else missing the pop quiz antics? <BR> <BR>Yves, can nothing be done about
  the poor pop quiz languishing down in the basement? Perhaps we make a clean break

    Like Randy mentioned, I think that part of the reason there&#39;s no action in
    the Quiz, is because no-one knows it&#39;s at the bottom of list...

  body: Hear! Hear!  I completely agree with Mike on this. This is the reason I have
    not participated in this game. It&#39;s one thing to sharpen ID skills, but this
    kind of obscure character showing off is not worth my time. I like it if I learn
    about new fonts, or underappreciated or rare ones, but learning about unused characters
    in fonts  has almost no value to me. <BR> <BR>I know, that means I shouldn&#39;t
    participate in the Quiz, right? Something for everybody, I guess.  <BR> <BR>

    <BR> <BR>That was certainly part of the problem. But I can also relate to the
