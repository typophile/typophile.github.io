  body: "<em>Not sure of the precise weight or foundry, that full stop looks strange.</em>\r\n\r\nI
    believe it is a Futura, heavy, medium or bold due to the flattened terminals,
    possibly distorted, otherwise what explains the punctuation (except an annoying
    design foible)?\r\nTim"

  body: The Avenir "G" is wrong (See "HUGE"). Lots of fairly close matches (Proxima
    Nova, various Grotesk).

  body: Nothing seems to be an exact match. I wonder if it is a customised Futura,
    such as Vignelli's Our Futura. Did VW have their own version?
