body: "When teaching typography, I sometimes like to start presentations off with
  an interesting video.\r\n\r\nFor example, a friend of mine just showed me the DVNO
  video.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting we all pitch in and help each other build a library
  of typography videos to excite young design students. Imagine a room full of 18-24
  year old 1st-2nd year design students who don\u2019t know a lot about type, and
  if they do, they probably think it\u2019s dull.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve used\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9trOJFXRvVM\r\n\r\nA

    certainly not about typefaces, I\u2019ll have to give it a few more views and
    do a little background but I\u2019m pretty confident its referring to where we
    are regarding social and political contexts, the video footage on the screen behind
    them is most likely from a specific movement and I\u2019d hazard a guess that
    his silent partner is a figure that is a clue to the context. She has to be important
    on a level other that musical artist given that she doesn\u2019t sing.\r\n\r\nInitial
    reaction with no research makes me feel \u201Cwhere are we now?\u201D is a general
