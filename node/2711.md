  though all the capitals and lower case letters are done, as well as a first shot
  at the numbers. No kerning or anything yet, because FCP 2&#39;s kerning feature
  is extremely user-hostile. <BR> <BR>The text below &#40;not the title&#41; is set

  body: Oh, I like this.  It has a nice hand tooled feel to it, and is kind of whimsical
    with some art nouveau and old west mixed in.  I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a smallcaps
    face?  If so, any chance of actual lower case letters?

  body: Yes, it&#39;s small caps. It started life as a header I lettered for some
    game materials. <BR> <BR>I had no plans for lower case, but two of the characters
    that are giving me grief are the @ and the monogram I use in place of the rectangle
    for any undrawn characters, which is my three initials married together in lower
    case. So it&#39;s not impossible. . . .

  body: Thanks, Paul. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Yeah, I sorta got the idea there were people
    who were able to work a lot faster than I could. I just put it down to my being
    a beginner. The big programs are faster and easier too, huh? <BR> <BR>Umm, to
    keep this on topic, I had the idea of doing some swash caps and other goodies
    in an alternate font. So there.

  body: I rellly like this one, but i&#39;m into victorian and blackletter faces and
    this one seems to sample from both those styles. swash caps would be very much
    in the spirit of victorian type and if yer real ambitious swash lc letters too.
    <BR> <BR>you really should download the demo version of FontLab from their website
    and convert your outlines to PS outlines just so you can see how much easier it
    is to work with beziers instead of pushing on- and off-curve points around - the
    difference is incredible! I started with font creator too it got me hooked on
    the whole font making thing. <BR> <BR>g&#39;luck with this one.
