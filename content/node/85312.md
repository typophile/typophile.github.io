  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Goggling_4358.png]\r\nHobo (1910), by
    Morris Benton, his version of a popular lettering style of the time.\r\nSouvenir
    (1914), also by Benton, with the form of the \"g\" taken, it is said, from certain
    German types:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/14230\r\nSchelter-Cursive (1906).\r\nPerhaps
    there is something art nouveau and organic in this trope, more tadpole than pince-nez.\r\n\r\nAnother
    Schelter & Giesecke face, Belwe (1913), has \"g\" with a stunted tail, though
    not open.\r\nContinuing the German connection, Kabel (1925) has an open \"g\"
    tail; and like Souvenir this too was given the ITC treatment and became hugely
    popular in the 1970s.\r\n\r\nAs this was the form of \"g\" that appeared in the
    Javal type (late 19th century), there may be some association of this letter shape
    with legibility issues.\r\n\r\nJaval type reworked recently in Minuscule.\r\n\r\nCheltenham
    (1896), tail terminated quite clearly by a ball serif, source of another ITC revival."

    am specially loving the first one, coming from a corporate font for the danish
    rails company DSB, made by [[http://www.kontrapunkt.com/en/cases/dsb/|Kontrapunkt]],
    a danish agency. It\u2019s \u201Cinspired by old Danish sign painters\u201D. Referenced

    corporate font for [[http://typophile.com/node/68964|Urban Splash]] project by

    are interesting sans examples.\r\n\r\nSearching more, among the first pages of
    Typophile\u2019s search for \u201Cdanish g\u201D leads to many fonts. A lot of
    sans serifs. \r\n\r\nMr Nick Shinn, do you know where I could fing any Javal specimens
    online ? The optical / legibility questions that lead to Huot-Marchand Minuscule
    g, demanding that i stops on the baseline are an idea I\u2019d want to digg.\r\n\r\nThank
    you."
