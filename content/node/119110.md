  for a link to the topic \u2013 but can you recommend typefaces which feature especially
  beautiful numerals? In this case I'm not interested in the letters so numerals-only
  typefaces would suffice. I have no restrictions on what beauty entices in this case.
  I'm just curious as to what's out there when it comes to numerals."

  body: Any more though? If you have pictures rather than fonts of beautiful numerals
    I would love to see those as well.
