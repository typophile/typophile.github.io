body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a roman capital \"Q\", that would be a very
  light grey, and large, against a white background on a question-answer page of a
  website (The left part and part of the top left of the letterform would be off-screen).
  Black type (Helvetica Neue Cond at about 28pt) would be in the forefront as a question,
  with smaller supporting body copy below. \r\n\r\nAny recommendations of an attractive
  non-sans \"Q\" that you might find particularly extraordinary?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nAndrew"
