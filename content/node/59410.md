body: "I'm doing a logo for an elementary school teachers association. Any suggestions?
  Please no children's scripts.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for professional, yet friendly,
  caring. Something that says \"up-to-date, current,\" etc, but not faddish."

  body: With elementary school books I can't help but think of Clarendons but maybe
    something with the timeless appeal of Nick Shinn's new <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/shinntype/modern_suite_full_family">Modern
    Suite</a>, which feels a bit more sophisticated.
