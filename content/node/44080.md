  to spell \"Abessynian\" in the first poster:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cafepress.com/dogs_of_war/4668414\r\n\r\nThe
  others are used for the top two lines in the following, \"OBEY THE BASSETT\":\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cafepress.com/dogs_of_war/981540\r\n\r\nI've
  a feeling the \"OBEY\" font may have also been used by Shepard in the original OBEY
  series, but I couldn't find an example.\r\n\r\nI'll be most grateful if you can
  improve my knowledge of fonts a little bit.\r\n\r\nGravitas"

  body: Okay, I just found the What The Font tool ( http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont
    ), and I was able to identify the "aBESSyNIaN" as Nicotine. So I'm still looking
    for the two fonts used in OBEY THE BASSETT (which the tool did not provide any
    meaningful matches for).
