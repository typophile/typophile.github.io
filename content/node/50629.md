  or so, that is an easily available font?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I printed [[http://vllg.com/Underware/Dolly/mudTyper+Weights/|Dolly]] out
    just today at 6pt.  The whole typeface has a nice dark complexion to it so you
    can read the characters well even at small sizes, nice and crisp, whereas so many
    other typefaces start looking brittle and weak around this point range.  (I was
    surprised to see how sad the mighty Adobe Garamond Pro looks at 6pt.)\r\n\r\nDolly
    also looks great in a lot of other settings so it's worth licensing it as a workhorse
    in your personal collection.\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nRahim"
