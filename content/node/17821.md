body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI'm working on a women's fragrance project and the theme is a
  swinging 1960s mod-girl kind of Carnaby Street look. Twiggy, vibrant colors and
  patterns, etc. Part of the packaging features Op Art patterns. I'm looking for a
  typeface that reinforces this theme. The research I've done has uncovered surprisingly
  staid and low-key typography on the actual graphics from the era, at least connected
  with fashion, and none of it seems right. I'd like something mod and idealy feminine/girly
  and fun, energetic, that evokes the era and its spirit. Maybe a script. Any ideas?
  Thanks much for any help you can offer.\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    by the time I was old enough for a Vespa I'd discovered peace love etc.\r\n\r\nI
    still fondly recall my favorite outfit of orange wide-wale cord flared hipster
    trousers (3\" belt with round brass buckle), and a Regency-style green jacket,
    double-breasted, 5-button, flap vent at back. I must of looked a real Kinky burk,
    but me mum didn't say owt, bless her heart."

    \ There was a return to hand-made craft (anything from bead making to macram\xE9[sp?]
    and bread). The original practitioners were young and free from convention but
    soon Madison Avenue found something fresh to mimic. The result was kinda' almost
