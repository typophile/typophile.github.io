  cover for him. He has the aim of making his band appear mysterious and enigmatic,
  although the songs are less that than silly songs about robots. And they wear fake
  mullets.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, here are two ideas I came up with. Let me know what you
  think. Do they appear mysterious and enigmatic enough. And how would YOU make something
  appear so?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ded-bundee-web_4601.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ded-bundee-2-web_4429.jpg]"

    sleeve. No type (not even on spine) just a barcode on the back. Thankfully it
    was a fantastic purchase.\r\n\r\nMysterious = nothing. :)"

  body: "I have that same Autechre CD. It is nice. I tend to notice that a lot of
    electronica has simplistic covers like that though. Basic color, small or no text.\r\n\r\nAfter
    the Beatles and Metallica, is there room for another plain colored album with
    nothing on it? Thinking about it, Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here was hidden by
    a brown paper slip case on top of the artwork with the burning man. Some people
    to this day don't know what the cover looks like. THAT's mysterious. "
