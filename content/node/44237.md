    one of the HTML pages, not only in the PDF (if you do, I couldn't find it).

    The display face just gets a week as the highlight font and then new blood takes
    its place.\r\n\r\nGood work no matter how long it stays up, Nick!\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    \r\nSeems high concept is merely a pretext for drawing some nice old letter shapes

    helpful, Nick -- although now I have to lie awake wondering whether my fascination
    with this lovely face warrants buying a single OT font, or the whole family in
    the more limited package. But it's a very, very sensible pricing scheme, I think."

    Italic.\r\nThe Pro Roman has small caps and alternate figures, which are a lot
    of fun to use, but not quite so essential for setting Italic."
