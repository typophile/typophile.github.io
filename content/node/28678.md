  use gTalk (google talk messenger) for chatting/talking purpose?...If anyonw of you
  have plz gimme your mail IDs..I really wants to talk you guys. As in its very long
  process to put the work on typophile and then waiting for feedback...As you know
  am a student and face lots of problems on daily basis..some time i need immediate
  solutions and then there no one to ask :( so its just to disturb you some time to
  get proper answers/feedback. Am being a bit selfish...but relly sorry...i dont have
  any typgraphy faculty here at NID who can gimme feedback.\r\n\r\nmy gmail ID is
  \r\nsnrajpurohit@gmail.com\r\n\r\nthank you:)\r\n\r\nsatya\r\nstudent, graphic design\r\n"
