body: "Hello guys \r\nVery Happy New Year :) \r\n\r\nTell me please, is there any
  special name for such typography style? Is there a typeface that looks like that,
  or all these are\r\nhand made ? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/332cf582886d8d910c355e62c8e22a68_4067.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso,
  there is one more style i'm curious about. Often appear along the above style. Like
  an edge of the top typeface, slightly offset. I have seen it many times, but now
  that I want to find out more, can't seem to find sample.\r\nAlso, I'm sorry, my
  limited English vocabulary making it hard to express. That's best I could find for
  now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_6167.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you for taking the time to read, and once again, you have a very good and happy
  new year :)\r\n\r\nregards\r\nSeba"

    probably easier to purchase.
