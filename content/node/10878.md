body: I hope this is a good place for this post. So I need to insert a company logo
  into a typeface. Is there a standard key combo that people use to do this? Or do
  I just pick a little-used character and write over it? I hate to blow away the eastern
  euro support built into the face but since it&#39;s a US company &#40;for now&#41;
  it&#39;ll probably be one of those...  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m counting on Hrant for this
  one. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, free beer in VT. <BR> <BR>g <BR>

  body: I&#39;m flattered, but I think you should count more on an encoding guru,
    like John Hudson. <BR> <BR>With my little knowledge, I might put it where the  &#34;sputnik&#34;
    is &#40;that generic currency symbol&#41;, and map it to some memorable shift-option
    position. But if you go lower-ASCII, I might consider repurposing the &#34;pipe&#34;
    &#40;shift-backslash&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; I hate to blow away the eastern euro
    support built into the face but since it&#39;s a US company <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t
    worry, I&#39;m pretty sure getting rid of eccents &#39;n&#39; stuff is part of
    the US Master Plan. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: This depends on what kind of font you are producing, in what environments
    it will be used, and whether you need documents produced with it to be accessible
    on older systems or across platforms. Today, I would favour Andreas&#39; solution
    and simply use a codepoint from the Unicode Private Use Area, but this presumes
    that the font has a Unicode cmap &#40;TrueType or OpenType&#41;, or some other
    method of mapping from glyphs to character codes, and is going to be used in a
    Unicode text processing environment &#40;Windows NT, 2000 or XP; Cocoa apps on
    OS X; ? on Linux&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you are making Type 1 fonts, or are otherwise
    aiming at legacy environments, then you may find it expedient to replace a character
    in one of the standard 8-bit codepages. Since any use of the logo is screwing
    up text anyway, it doesn&#39;t really matter which character you replace. If you
    want easy keyboard access, Hrant&#39;s suggestion of the bar character is not
    bad. <BR> <BR>Another thing we&#39;ve done in the past is to make a separate logo
    font, that contains only a single glyph. This discourages customers from trying
    to typeset documents with font that might contain their logo replacing a character
    that might occur in normal text.

  body: If the logo font is destined for Macintosh Postscript Type 1, then you might
    consider the shift-option-k &#40;dec 240&#41; position, which usually contains
    Apple&#39;s apple logo. &#40;You&#39;ll need to generate the font with Macintosh
    encoding and not Adobe Standard, so that the character isn&#39;t pulled from the
    Symbol font. I think you&#39;ll need to do the same if you replace the &#34;pipe&#34;
    character also.&#41; <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR>
