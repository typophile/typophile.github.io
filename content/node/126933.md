body: "The extension allows a type designer draw letters with a centerline \u2013skeleton.
  The stroke is rendered according to a skeleton and nib preset. Its advantage is
  the ability to change nib width and angle by a single point as well as globally
  by a master or a single glyph. Moreover, the stroke is rendered into a glyph as
  if it was the outline without a necessity to expand stroke to outlines.\r\n\r\nTo
  give it a try, download the plugin at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2fFuQfA\">letterinkapp.com</a>.
  We are looking forward the skeletons results and your comments.\r\n\r\nEnjoy"
