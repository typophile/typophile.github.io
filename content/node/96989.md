body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nI very strongly remember someone asking a question about drawing
  the character S in fontlab. I tried for an hour and i was reduced to quasi tears
  and all i had was a image of a dragon drawn by a 2 year old in my 'S' glyph cell.
  Can anyone direct me to it.(I wasted 30 minutes trying to find that question here).
  If i is not there can anyone share their method to draw the perfect S.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nT"

    Answer? Come on.\r\n\r\nBut if you want a cheap shortcut: make a smooth single
    curve, and auto-expand it. But even that would only be a very modest start towards
    something <em>you</em> think is good.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "This is what I do, step by step. First I define the top and bottom parts
    of the letter, ignoring the middle section. I judge by eye where I think the upper
    left and lower right inner and outer curves should be, and place extrema points
    here.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tiro.com/John/S1.gif\r\n\r\nThen I am ready to define
    the middle section. I do this by moving just the vertical control handles from
    the extrema points, until the bend of the S is the height I want it and the distance
    at the middle is appropriate to the weight of the typeface.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tiro.com/John/S2.gif\r\n\r\nThen
    I draw guidelines between the opposite control handles of the inner and outer
    curves, noting where these cross the outline.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tiro.com/John/S3.gif\r\n\r\nThen
    I place nodes at these positions on the outline, and do constained movements of
    the control handles coming off these nodes in order to adjust the weight through
    the bend towards the extrema.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tiro.com/John/S4.gif\r\n\r\nThat's
    it.\r\n\r\nYou will find, if you are eventually going to make a TrueType font,
    that the structure resulting from this approach gives you everything you need
    to use the interpolate hint instruction to control the middle of the bend.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tiro.com/John/S5.gif"

    fashion(Do the top part first, then middle(not bothering how it turns out)  and
    bottom and then join them(or vice versa)) or do the bottom part and top part  differently
    and then join them?'

  body: "It hardly matters. Usually, I have already done the uppercase C, so I begin
    the S by copying the top terminal of the C and using that as a basis for the upper
    right part of the S. Once I've done the top part so that it looks good, I'll usually
    copy it, rotate it 180 degrees, and use it as a basis for creating the bottom
    part. Obviously a lot of editing takes place to adjust the width, size and angle
    of terminal, etc.. Then I join the two segments and proceed as described in my
    previous post.\r\n\r\nAs Hrant says, there is no one 'correct' way to design an
    S. This is just the process I have found fastest and most reliable, and which
    has the benefit of producting an outline structure that lends itself to hinting."

    way). I still have a lot to do but it is mostly little tweaking to get the curves

  body: "> Can you please tell me what this means?\r\n\r\nOne needs to train one\u2019s
    eyes. The eye tells the hand how to draw. Be it with a pen or a mouse, in any
    case.\r\nIf you master curve handling in the glyph window, this does, however,
    not enlighten you about *how an S-shape ought to be*.\r\nI\u2019d suggest a little
    experiment to you: print out a single letter S of a classical typeface at 400p.
    Take a second sheet of paper, ink and a pointed brush. Try to copy that letterform
    as exactly as you can, by eyesight only \u2026\r\n\r\nBtw., for training I recommend
    to start rather with I, L, T, P\u2026 and not S. S is one of the hardest to draw,
    right next to O."
