  magazine</a> invites you all to take part in the project \u201CA Library In The
  Forest\u201D (\u201CUna Biblioteca Nella Foresta\u201D).\r\n\r\nIn Congo-Brazzaville,
  in the hearth of the equatorial forest, there\u2019s a village name Zanag\xE0 ;
  the inhabitants, thank to the wise guidance of young priest Don Rufin, expressed
  the wish of reading.\r\nNo food, no clothes or money, our African friends need books.\r\n\r\nWho
  better than us, people who deal with prints and designs, can understand such a noble
  demand ?\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to the growth of \u201CA Library In The
  Forest\u201D in Congo-Brazzaville please send one or more books (secondhand texts
  are welcome as well) to the address underneath. The only limitation is that <em>the
  books must be in French</em> with the exception of picture/children`s books.\r\n\r\nThe
  books will be directly posted to Zanag\xE0 by the volunteers who take care of the
  project.\r\n\r\nThanking you all for your solidarity, we wish you a Merry Christmas
  and a Happy New Year.\r\n\r\n<em>The Graphicus Staff.</em>\r\n\r\nGRAPHICUS\r\nPROGETTO
