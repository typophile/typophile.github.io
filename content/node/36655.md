body: "The typeface for \"BISHOP ALLEN\" on this album cover is terrific, but I don't
  know what the name of it is, and the website where there is \"Everything you ever
  wanted to know about the band Bishop Allen\" doesn't even mention it. Can you believe
  that? I find it shocking. Anyway, if any of you know what it is, or if you have
  some good Victorian era typefaces to show me, I'd just be super happy. (Perhaps
  you may even wish to dispute the \"Victorianesque\" of the typeface I have shown,
  by all means, tell me what it's all about!) \r\nSincelery,\r\nRyan[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bishopallen_3969.jpg]"

    it''s not a Victorian typeface. Do you know any good ones? '
