body: "On a PC, will Illustrator 10 use OpenType?\r\nFor example, I have Batang in
  OT format, which Quark reads, and even MS Word reads, but Illustrator will not.
  The only management software I have is ATM light. Will getting Extensis allow Illustrator
  10 to recognize open type, or is there another issue here?\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Whats an Illustrator issue and I'm total agree with you this is one of Adobes
    dark sides. So you will have to upgrade to CS(11). My upgrade to version 10 is
    the most useless I have ever done. \r\n\r\nFor the record, I work mostly with
    the super fast and stable version 8.  Since then every new version came up with
    more & more effects, click & play and kiddy stuff. Imagine, the statistics plugin
    is sitll the same old one like in version 7 and how crazy is its usage.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    this have something to do by leading the software development by the marketing.\r\n\r\n--<a

  body: "ok crugen, the Column Graph Tool - to render charts is still like version
    7. If you update the data most of the effects are reseted, some effects and filters
    will work only to the cost you break the conection to the data and so on. The
    whole handling could be much nicer. \r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\"
