  seems impossible to actually go some place and test and see for youself. So I\u2019d
  really appreciate your suggestions and hear about your experiences. The thing should
  offer everything a graphic designer would expect (color calibration ...) of course.
  Flatscreen is probably the way to go.\r\nThanx."

  body: "Swissmiss asked this question a little while ago and got a ton of replies,
    though a good few blindly shouted \"Apple!\" even though their displays are, quite
    frankly, weak: the display in my brand new Santa Rosa MacBook is awful \u2013
    it's a Samsung panel LTN133W1, made in the 1st quarter of 2006, and exhibits the
    \"dithering\" that so many people have complained about \u2013 and the Cinema
    Displays really, really need updating. I reckon Apple will announce new models
    in January, along with new Mac Pros and the mythical thin MBP. Anyway, here's
    the post:\r\nhttp://swissmiss.typepad.com/weblog/2007/11/advice-from-my-.html\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I'd hit \"cheap but big with decent performance\" option and go for the Dell 2707WFP
    (single-DVI connection) when it's on discount, along with a third-party calibrator,
    as I said in the link above. I'm still a little amazed that I'm the only one that
    mentioned hardware calibration in that thread, all displays tend to be mediocre
    without profiling. I'm willing to live with the trade-off of poorer performance
    of LCDs vs. CRTs in exchange for the larger display size, and the extra desk space
    is quite welcome, too. SED does sound promising, though If you need something
    now there aren't any displays available using that technology.\r\n\r\nBy far the
    most thorough review of the Dell I've found online has been at Anandtech; it's
    a real shame they don't review displays more often:\r\nhttp://www.anandtech.com/printarticle.aspx?i=2961\r\n\r\nThat
    review should give an idea of the competition, too, though it's 6 months old so
    there'll probably be newer models about.\r\n"

    of the Cinemas. Get an Eye One Display 2 to calibrate it and you're good. If you
    are more demanding look at EIZO - very expensive but probably the best flat panel
    these days.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to buy a good CRT these days - Barco,
    Sony, LaCie all quit making them.\r\n\r\nI'm with Patty on the flicker - I can

  body: On a side note, has anyone had experience with radio interference banding
    on an LCD monitor? I live next door to a ham radio operator and it plays havoc
    with my CRT. Apart from the vertical stripes everything looks like it has a drop
    shadow and reversed text is nearly impossible to read.

    the specs and, for the same size/pixels, the Dell wins. Better specs, better price,
    better warranty. (I was reading about high failure rates with the Apples.) And
    the Dell (2407WFP-HC) easily spins to portait (vertical), if that's your cup of

  body: Assuming you've got at least a single DVI-I connector on that Radeon (I sure
    hope so) then the maximum res. you can do is 1920x1200, I think. So for native
    resolution you've could go for the Dell 27", the Apple 24" or the Eizo CG241W.
    For more than that (i.e. the 30" models) you'll need dual-link DVI.

    annoys me is that the lightness of the screen seems uneven.\r\nThere\u2019s a
    gradient from darker (top) to lighter (bottom).\r\nIf I turn the display 90 degrees
    the gradient will go from right to left (so it\u2019s not a viewing angle or environmental
    lighting thing).\r\nIs that normal? Or is the thing bad and I need a replacement?\r\nAnybody
    experienced something like that? Is it a known problem?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    wide gamut. I think they are up to 92% or so of aRGB which means they display
    a lot more colors you can't print and a much wider gamut than almost anyone viewing
    your webpages would. Most monitors are somewhere around sRGB, which is why that
    is the standard color profile for web work. It is also a lot closer to the print
    gamut. So people are struggling a little bit with these wide gamut monitors, seeing
    changes in what they see on screen and what is printed or on the web. Especially
    the reds for this NEC in particular, making skin tones particularly elusive.\r\n\r\nWide
    gamut is the future and I'm sure we'll adjust\u2026\r\n\r\npbc\r\n\r\nAll ideas,
    theories and statements are subject to change without notice."

    that is appropriate. For my own information, is anyone using a single system that
    can switch on the fly from, say, D50 to ColorMatch? And, does this require more
    frequent calibration?
