  body: "It seems to be a customization of Engraver's Roman, with a Baskerville-ish
    C. Bob Alonso had a very close take on the Engraver's typeface with his [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/richmond-hill/|Richmond
    Hill]]. Many of the other Engraver's Romans have a more triangular serif on the
    N. Your sample has a ruled serif that isn't much like any of the Engraver's fonts
    I saw, but the R is certainly like this group.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
