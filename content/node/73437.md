body: "Hi,\r\nI'm sorry if my demand is weird, but here it is: I currently have to
  display non-western glyphs in a software that seems to only handle windows-1252
  (or maybe it is ISO 8859-1 or ISO 8859-15, doesn't matter...). I finally found an
  idea for a workaround: splitting a font that handles, say, Japanese characters,
  into potentially dozens of other fonts that map different glyphs of the mother font
  to what should normally be printable western characters. So if I need to render
  glyph, I will use simple math to choose the font and the character I should actually
  use (The aim here is to write a script anyway so the math isn't a problem).\r\n\r\nDo
  any of you guys have any idea how I could do this and, most importantly, automate
  the creation of the fonts as much as possible?\r\n\r\nActually, the more I think
  about this crazy idea, the more I'm convinced it's already been used...\r\n\r\nFor
  those interested: the bad software in question is autodesk 3ds max, I'm trying to
  automate the creation of 3d meshes of characters in various languages."
