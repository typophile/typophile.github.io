    that creates the wrong mood or feeling. Or a font is overused. Or a font is simply
    inappropriate, like tiny text in a font that's hard to read when tiny. And so
    forth.\r\n\r\n(But keep in mind that a few people getting upset about a font choice
    doesn't mean that everyone here is upset about it.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    designers or design educators, or in the font business, care about typography,
    but these days anyone with a computer that has a font menu and options for type
    size etc. may be considered a typographer\u2014just as anyone who uses a pen may
    be considered a writer\u2014and many amateurs therefore also care about typography
    and the fonts they use."

  body: "I think we get wound up by the misuse of certain typefaces and typographic
    abuse firstly because we're passionate about where our knowledge and skills are
    at and secondly because we have to protect centuries of typographic progress.
    When typography takes centuries to develop and the invention of the typewriter
    annuls a lot of that progress, that hurts. It's part of our heritage. When the
    invention of the keyboard is then based on the typewriter, that also hurts. Functions
    have been added back later but are not well accessible for most people. People
    consistently write 50x50cm to denote dimensions while that makes absolutely no
    sense, as you mean to say \"50 times 50\" and not \"50 ex 50\". People say it
    right, but typographically there is a loss. When I see people just don't care
    about spelling anymore and don't use proper punctuation, not only do I get frustrated
    but I feel embarrassed and I can't take them seriously.I don't expect everyone
    to have the same affinity with typography I do, but I do expect people to care
    about the way they present themselves and how they perceive the world. It does
    matter which typefaces are used and how they're used and what they should or would
    conjure up in terms of feelings and associations. It's the reason brands work,
    why marketing is allowed to work, why your book is comfortable to read, why your
    website functions as efficiently as it does. You're asking us why we care like
    it's a very specific question, but I'm a perfectionist because I care about how
    the world looks and I have clear ideas on how it should look and in what way I
    can improve things \u2014 not only typographically. I just care, generally speaking.
    People who don't care I don't understand..\r\n\r\nPeople consistently use hyphens
    for all kinds of purposes that have nothing to do with hyphenating words, and
    the en dash and em dash they should be using in their appropriate context are
    alien to most people, while I would argue it's the same kind of regress as when
    you would suddenly abandon the comma and only use dots, or remove 1000 words from
    your language because you figure you will do fine without them. Yes, you might,
    but the point is that you're losing part of your vocabulary so the range in which
    you can express yourself is restricted. How is that a good thing or even something
    to be indifferent about? I suppose we care because we want to protect our heritage
    and try our best to keep improving and expanding typographic practice."

  body: "I think that there is a somewhat hostile mentality against the typographic
    community that typographers and type designers nitpick typographic minutiae (like
    using inch marks for quotations) are merely for vainglory because nitpicking shows
    how these type people can discover minor details that the public won\u2019t be
    able to recognize. \u201CYou guys pick those innocuous things and rant about it
    just to show how good you are. Those innocuous things actually doesn\u2019t matter;
    even if they go wrong nothing serious would happen \u2013 it\u2019s not like people
    die from bad type or something.\u201D\r\n\r\nMy response is this:\r\n\r\nPeople
    really could possibly die from bad type. This may be less relevant when you are
    reading a book, but it is definitely important when you are reading a signage
    when you are driving on the highway, or when you are trying to find a route to
    escape a fire in a complex airport. Bad typography obstructs information, and
    people can die in these dire and contingent situations where information is urgently
    needed. If I recall right, FF Info is designed in the aftermath of a transportation
    accident in Germany. \r\n\r\nOne potential objection would be like this: \u201COkay,
    I\u2019ll give you the point that typographic nitpicking is justified when in
    serious situations like signage and way finding systems. But if you\u2019re still
    nitpicking while reading a damn pamphlet, you\u2019re just showing off.\u201D
    To this my response is that it\u2019s very hard to determine what a \u201Cserious
    situation\u201D is (\u201Ca serious situation is where people die\u201D is apparently
    not a good enough criterion), and a pamphlet can also be serious \u2013 assume
    that this book is to be read by a dyslexic child who can\u2019t read normal text.
    Therefore, instead of distinguishing between \u201Cserious situation where we
    need to be picky\u201D and \u201Ccasual situation where picky is vainglory\u201D
    why don\u2019t we just be always picky? Won\u2019t that solve the problem straight?
    After all, typographers and type designers are titles made for those who specialize
    in this field. What\u2019s wrong with them if they are just doing their jobs?
    On the other hand, if I use a slanted comic sans with tight leading and negative
    tracking and multiple consecutive hyphens to set a bible, would you (my imaginary
    opponent) still want to read it and buy it? Wouldn\u2019t you (assume you are
    a Catholic/Christian) call it a serious invasion of God\u2019s divinity?\r\n\r\nI
    will avoid the common defense that \u201Cit\u2019s the details that matters.\u201D
    This is not because I don\u2019t believe in this motto; in fact I increasingly
    realize that sometimes a small change in one stroke can affect the whole typeface,
    and a small increase in leading can change the whole composition. I don\u2019t
    use this defense because it\u2019s been so commonly used that it has lost its
    merit to stand up against those unfamiliar with this field \u2013 \u201CMeh, he\u2019s
    just posing the routine, old-fashioned talk about how details matters. We all
    know that.\u201D\r\n\r\nMy punchline lies in here: to claim that attention for
    details only matters in \u201Cserious\u201D situations is to claim that everything
    that do not substantially relate to the subsistence of mankind is innocuous (I\u2019ve
    already stated that \u201Cserious\u201D is very vague, but for the sake of my
    argument I am assuming that \u201Cserious\u201D means \u201Cvital for the subsistence
    of mankind\u201D). Not only type, but also anything that does not have immediate
    utility (like food production and water, etc.; please bear with my crude use of
    utilitarianism). To accept and advocate this claim is to mount a hostile aggression
    against art (i.e. Van Gogh\u2019s painting), against design (i.e. Dieter Rams\u2019s
    pocket radio), against music, against the study of philosophy...\r\n\r\nTo call
    typographers as \u201Cnitpickers\u201D is not an argument; it is a character assassination."

    excellent and average typography (except obvious things like wrong quote marks).
    It's not their job, not their expertise. But a professional does it the right
    way because they are a pro. \r\n\r\nI know it's frustrating when a client thinks
    you're \"nitpicking\", but part of the job is dealing with clients and being able
    to explain why some things are important. And it's not necessary to explain every
    tiny detail; they hire a pro to take care of the details for them."

      that the guy in a signage shop prepares the actual signage plate, but isn\u2019t
      the typeface of the signage still a result of the type designer\u2019s work?
      To my knowledge, the US government commissioned its Highway and Clearview typeface
      for signage use (TFJ does his Interstate based on Highway). There\u2019s also
      the Wayfinding Sans and FF Transit."

    and the fonts were commissioned, but I've seen many highway signs that didn't
    look very good and doubt if most receive much design consideration.\r\n\r\nBut
    I was speaking more of the everyday directional signage that you find in hotels,
    office buildings, etc. I was staying in a nice hotel last week and the emergency
    signage was awful. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, there are good sign companies.
    In fact I have a relative who works at one. But outside of transportation hubs
    and upscale buildings, I don't think directional signage gets a whole lot of attention
    from designers."
