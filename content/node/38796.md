body: I saw this wonderful identity in Japan last week and was hoping to source the
  original typeface, or as near as possible; instantly reminded me of Eero Saarinen
  and 1950s New York which, given Ulvac's business of heavy industrial manufacturing,
  may be similar in age. Many thanks in advance. <br><br><a href="http://www.ulvac.co.jp">Ulvac
