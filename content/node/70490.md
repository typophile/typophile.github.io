body: "Hello everybody,\r\nI'm submitting to your critique a display font called Elektro.
  It began as custom lettering job I did for a friend's band logo. It's inspired by
  their prog rock music style with a touch of modernist aesthetic. I'm currently working
  on alternate weights, as well as a matching italic and a slab serif. Any advice
  on how to improve it is greatly appreciated.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elektro_01_3474.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elektro_02_3601.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elektro_03_5435.png]"

  body: The /e/ looks a little heavy and thick. Could you try making the crossbar
    come up at the intersection on the left, like the bottom of the /u/?

  body: "@eliason: Thanks for the suggestion! You're right about the 'e' being too
    heavy. I made corrections to it, and came up with 3 possible versions. I prefer
    the first option, since it keeps the overall clean look of the font.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elektro_04_3955.png]"

  body: Yup, the third is what I was picturing but I think you're right that the first
    alternative is better.

  body: "This is nice work and I think you've done the right thing with the e.\r\nHere
    are some suggestions, take with a bit of salt:\r\n\xA3 is out of character. The
    base needs to be flat in this style of font.\r\nI think the guillemets should
    be bevelled like the greaterthan/lessthan symbols.\r\nI'd make the tops and bottoms
    of the braces and brackets longer as the proportions of the alphabetics are quite
    wide.\r\nSection sign is really interesting!\r\nHorizontal arm of 4 could be a
    bit lower to open up the counterspace and balance the figure better.\r\nI'd make
    the circles of % a bit darker.\r\nB looks wide?\r\nCrossbar of f looks lower than
    the one on t. I'm quite a fan of low crossbars but I think they should be the
    same height.\r\nX and x may benefit from some offset.\r\ny may need more counterspace
    above its tail; can you move the junction up? This style is quite hard to draw
    in my experience and might take a few tries to work nicely.\r\n\r\nIf you post
    a pdf we can take a closer look. Good work :)"

  body: "Yes, those all look like definite improvements to me, but the important thing
    is whether you're happy with them?\r\n\r\nA few more suggestions:\r\nAmpersand
    looks kind of dark. Maybe you can trim some weight off somewhere (shorter hood?)
    I'm not sure if the design isn't too funky?\r\nI'd make the outside of parentheses
    curved not straight.\r\n1: larger flag?\r\n2: the horizontal middle seems ungainly
    to me, can it slope slightly?\r\n4: widen the whole shape or just the counter
    slightly?\r\nW: feet should be wider apart \r\n\xA3: I'd switch the top and bottom
    terminals so the hood curls over and the foot is flat. The crossbar should be
    lower \u2014 think of an E rather than an f.\r\nCentre of currency sign looks
    too round for this font. \r\nDieresis on y is off-centre.\r\nn_acute needs diacritic
    a bit further right. Check s_acute too.\r\n\r\nI'm enjoying this one."

  body: "This is quite good.\r\n\r\nThe tilde of \xF1 is off-center.\r\nI'm not an
    expert on ogoneks, but I think they would be better moved to be flush with the
    right side of \u0118 and \u0119.\r\nThe ampersand is a bit cluttered.\r\n\r\nI
    disagree about W; I like it the way it is."

  body: "Thanks for the remarks guys, keep'em coming! They're greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n@Bendy:
    Of course I'm happy with the those changes. Your remarks were spot on!\r\n@Cerulean:
    I live and work in Poland as a designer (though I'm not Polish) and I'm very familiar
    with the ogonek. Generally the one on 'e' is not positioned flush right, it's
    supposed to flow down from the tail. Of course, there can be quite different stylistic
    approaches to it.\r\n\r\nI'll post some new stuff soon to reflect your suggestions
    as well as new glyphs for the Cyrillic and Greek alphabet. By the way, I designed
    this face for a rock band, so I was thinking that this can be used for music related
    design. But do you see other potential uses for it?\r\n\r\nAnd once again, thank
    you very much! "

  body: "Well, I finally managed to make time to post some updates to the design.
    I took all your observations under consideration and I also managed to add a Cyrillic
    and Greek set of characters. They are based on two codepages, but I'm considering
    adding more characters to cover the Unicode ranges for these two alphabets. Also,
    I made a poster for a friend's band (the one that inspired the design of Elektro)
    using a somewhat older version of the typeface:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stop_the_flood_5046.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nA

    updated the PDF in the first post with the new version. Let me know what you think,
    as always, feedback is greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

  body: "Looking good.\r\nI would consider bringing in the foot of lowercase el a
    bit - it opens up spaces within the words. \r\nI find the /st/ ligature a bit
    distracting. \r\nOn /W/, does the last stroke lean out too far? Looks thick in
    the middle, too. /w/'s last stroke also leans out to my eyes. Is your intention
    to have even stroke weights on /w/? It looks to me a bit like (l to r) thick thin
    thin thick, when convention would have it thick thin thick thin (or even thickness).
    \r\nI'd consider thin crossbars on yen and Euro, like $ has.\r\nWould you consider
    a version with longer extenders? They look pretty stubby here.\r\n\r\nThat rounded
    face is appealing, too!"
