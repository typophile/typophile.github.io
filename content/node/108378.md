body: Hello everyone. I am designing a book. The first part if of this series of book
  use blackletters for Initial Letter at the beginning of each chapter. I am trying
  to find a kind of more plain and elegant instead of blackletters. I would love to
  share some ideas about this issue. Thanks in advance.

    breathe, feel and hope when your world is collapsing and your life is now a lie
    - when sadness and despair become addictive? Led by the wearing need to learn
    the truth about her past, fearless, resilient Caitlin goes against her better
    judgment and returns to those who once betrayed her - those who stripped her of
    everything she knew and loved. Suddenly none of the rules that have kept seventeen-year-old
    Caitlin apply anymore and everything is on the line: her freedom, her family -
    EVERYTHING. Enter the lush extravagance of a secret society tucked away in the
    small town of Oaks and uncover the link between her past, present and uncertain
    future - unraveling the lines that bind her to the inexplicable events that threaten
    her own existence.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prologue_6681.JPG]
    \r\nAs you can see the first edition was composed by using  Palatino typeface.
    But my issue for now is to find a more elegant and austere Initial letter. I do
    not want to use a blackletter. I think is just not compatible."

    body: I think this is a good one, I suppose I can use Castellar not only with
      Palatino, but with other "classic" typefaces as well. I can not understand why
      some designers tend to use "extreme" initial letters, cluttered with so much
      details. I am not trying to blame the designer of the book but I assume blackletters
      as extravagant and unique to be easily compatible with a plain and legible typeface
      such as palatino is.
