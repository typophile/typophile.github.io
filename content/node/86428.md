  body: I had this exact problem once. As it turned out, there was an open path in
    one of my glyphs (actually, a single floating node).

  body: "I had the same problem - wrote to fontlab and they said it is going to take
    a month to fix it!\r\nThey expect me to sit and wait by for a month?\r\n \r\nGot
    a bit shocked from their poor customer service which in the end left me no choice
    but to cancel my copy of fontlab studio.\r\n\r\nIt really annoys me to find such
    poor service when you pay a premium, specially when alternatives are starting
    to show (Robofont which I will probably go for). Not once an apology or acknowledgement
    of responsibility for their product. \r\n \r\nAll in all the correspondent is
    pretty funny when you think about it. Attaching it here for your entertainment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYuval,\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your feedback. We are working on the problem.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAlex Petrov\r\nFontlab
    Ltd. Support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Alex\r\n\r\nDo you
    have an estimate of when you will solve this problem?\r\n\r\ndays? weeks? months?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nyuval\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nHi
    Yuval,\r\n\r\nI hope much we will release the final stable version within a month.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAlex
    Petrov\r\nFontlab Ltd. Support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
    Alex for your answer.\r\n\r\nA month is a bit longer than expected - Who do I
    talk to about compensation?\r\n\r\nI have bought fontlab studio with the believe
    that a Lion version is working (although unstable). \r\nI don't mind unstable
    version but this is unusable as I can't save or generate fonts. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nYuval\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\nYuval,\r\n\r\nStudio
    Public Preview 2 was released on Sept., 29 and was stable enough until Apple released
    10.7.2 on October, 12. I think we will fix this quickly in Public Preview 3. May
    be in a week but the final version will take not less than a month.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAlex
    Petrov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n\r\nI have bought
    my version after Lion came out thinking I would have a working version on my OS.\r\nBut
    I don't intend to loose a month's worth of work on a quite expensive program that
    doesn't work, regardless of the reason!\r\n\r\nI understand your position but
    Intel macs have been around for a while now and all my other programs work fine
    on Lion 10.7.2.\r\nMost graphic designers usually work on Macs so an investment
    in the mac platform seems kind of obvious. Doing it so late in the game is a bit
    crazy from a customer point of view.\r\n\r\nIf you can fix it into a working version
    in a week than fine, I'll sit by. \r\n\r\nIf not I would expect either a refund
    or some kind of compensation. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nYuval Toch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYuval
    Toch\r\n\r\nI can issue a credit at any time, just  forward me your receipt along
    with a short note stating that you would like to return the product (please mention
    the product by name) and that it has been removed from your computer and you will
    not ever be using it.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n\r\n(This time I
    lost it a bit and here is my rant back:)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlex Petrov\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    stated that I would be willing to wait for a week but you know what, from your
    reply I understand that fontlab is clearly not interested in my business and therefore
    I am not interested in yours as well.\r\n\r\nI would like to return Fontlab Studio
    and receive a refund for the \xA3493.85 I have paid. As soon as I receive the
    funds back I will remove the application from my computer and I will not be using
    it again ever.\r\nI would also advise anyone I know not to use it due to terrible
    customer service and poor technical support.\r\n\r\nPlease find my receipt attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely
    \r\n\r\nYuval Toch\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. \r\n\r\nNice job - You have managed to convert
    a slightly annoyed customer into an upset and angry one.\r\n\r\nOne advice: Hire
    a customer service expert as you are clearly not someone that should reply to
    your customers, specially since the font market is growing and wouldn't stay a
    niche one for long.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    wait a bit and ask around to see how things work?"
