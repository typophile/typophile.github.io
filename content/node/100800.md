    Office</a> should be the one. But Graphik is a great typeface, too, and a recommendable
    alternative."

  body: 'Wow, thank you! I love Graphic! Really the best of all worlds. Is it well
    spaced for body? (I''ll take the liberty of asking here since it seems like you
    know it). '

  body: "Glad to help :-)\r\n\r\nGraphik is not a typeface that invites extended reading,
    but I haven\u2019t noticed anything about the spacing that put me off. You could
    use it for shorter accompanying texts without running into trouble, I think. If
    you are uncertain, have a look at the very extensive specimen on the Commercial
    Type website."
