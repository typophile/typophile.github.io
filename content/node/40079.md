  font was used. Probably something basic like Times or Garamond. But I didn't *know*.\r\n\r\nIt
  also occurred to me that I was glad I didn't know, because if I did it might drive
  me to distraction. I might be thinking of the font, not the words I was reading.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  else find some truth in that?\r\n\r\n-Lindsay"

  body: Nope. Always think of the font. But the font only gets in the way when there's
    a problem - font is too small, hard to read, ugly, no ligatures, bad H&Js.

    might be thinking of the font, not the words I was reading.</em>\r\npatty's right
    -- although we may always think of the type (because, jeez, it's what we do),
    the only time it's a problem or interuptive is when the type has been used inappropriately
    or poorly. i would guess a horticulturist would look at a landscape, mentally
    noting the plants but appreciating the <em>garden.</em> but if something's wrong,
    it might stick out leaving him distracted and wondering. \"why are the ferns next
    to the cacti?\""

  body: (I should clarify that I'm a designer that admires type, so my experience
    may be far different from people who work in type for a living. Maybe I'm in some
    kind of infant stage of typophilia, where every new thing grabs my attention.)

  body: 'If you''re a designer or typographer, or just interested in type, it pretty
    much goes with the territory that you''ll note the type used in anything you read,
    or try to figure it out if you don''t recognize it offhand. But as Patty says,
    this doesn''t interfere with reading unless the type (or the typesetting) is bad.
    My wife likes to test me: she''ll have a book out of a library, hand it to me,
    and ask me was the typeface is. But she will get annoyed when opens up something
    like an art book to a specific page and say''s "Look at this!" I study it carefully
    for a minute, then announce the body type is Monotype Baskerville and the captions
    are Gill Sans. She sighs. "The picture! What do you think of the painting?"'

    engrossing and the typography is competent without being flashy.

  body: "I always find it relaxing and refreshing when I can read a book and not even
    notice the typography, where the words and the ideas just flow without thought
    or hesitation. \r\n\r\nWhich is the greatest achievement that good typography
    can attain to.\r\n\r\nBut when everything is set is ITC Garamond, I am immediately
    repulsed and only continue to read by concentrating <em>really hard</em> on the
    content."

  body: I don't know that it enhances my reading experience per se--i.e. the absorption
    and understanding of the author's message--but it does make me feel good when
    it's clear to me that the book designer went to some trouble to choose a font
    really matches the subject matter and tone of the book.

  body: I think it enhances my reading experience when comprehension rests on visible  differences.
    When there's a high frequency in a story of an inner voice set in italics, I consciously
    appreciate a face with a distinctive old-fashioned italic that keeps me from getting
    confused. I like it when manuals set off command terms from the text with an entirely
    different face. I like the bottomless timbre conjured in my mind when Death speaks
    in small caps.

  body: "An interesting and related question then would be--what typefaces do you
    find it easiest to ignore, that are so invisible the content alone speaks to you?
    I can think of a few in my case:\r\n\r\nTimes, Syntax, Lucida, Helvetica, Officina\r\n"

  body: "The typeface and the way that it is used enhances my 'viewing' experience
    and my desire to read or continue reading. Once I am immersed in the text, the
    visual experience becomes subliminal. If the writing sucks, I might then revert
    back to the visual by thinking, \"Nice type, too bad the writing is so dull or
    taxing.\"\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: Lindsay, \"infant typophilia\" sounds pretty
    serious! You had better consult your Pediatrician :-)"

  body: Maybe "you read best what you read most". Trough the years I've read so many
    books set in Simoncini Garamond&mdash;the default of most italian publishers&mdash;that
    I don't notice it anymore. There are some book faces that are a bit distracting
    to me, like Perpetua and Electra&mdash;even when properly set&mdash;because I
    stop to read to look at the letterforms. I suppose it's a very personal thing.
