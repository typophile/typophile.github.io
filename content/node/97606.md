  my own font. I have been doing some research and initial drawing (see [[http://www.doppel-n.com]])
  but I was wondering what letters I should start with in terms of \"setting up\"
  the alphabet. I imagine if certain shapes are settled they can be reused for similar
  letters. Help is very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nHP"

    starting with \"n\" and \"o\"; if it's for display try starting with \"a\" and
    \"g\". BTW the last time I said that our resident troll called me clueless (actually
    he  used harsher terminology) but now that Sevag has quoted Carter as having said
    something similar (which I had heard too) maybe he won't have the guts.\r\n\r\nAs
    an aside, your site is a cool idea. BTW have you tried the Polish Nutella? Around
    here it's half the price and almost as good.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    in your fonts 101 section.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509/\">Designing
    type by Karen Cheng,</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Stroke-Writing-Gerrit-Noordzij/dp/0907259308/\"

    The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst</a>\r\n\r\nAnd as far as
    which characters to start, i find it more easy to start with Uppercase and in
    uppercase start with letters with flat edges( H and N) , then go the ones with
    Slanting edges like V, W, X and then go to the ones with curved edges like C ,
    O and R. For the typeface I am currently working on, I drew all the characters
    on paper but unfortunately the design I finally got is different from the original
    one( it's better, so no qualms). As far as lower case is concerned , follow what
    hrant said, though i would keep g and s characters for the last."

    digital type I made. Admittedly I did have some professional experience at drawing
    and (rough) lettering for comps, but then again, Tobias Frere-Jones\u2019 \uFB01rst
    typeface, <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/similar?J0\">Dolores</a>, was along
    similar loosey goosey lines, and he was in art school at the time he designed
    it.\r\n\r\nThings were a bit more experimental 20 years ago, but nonetheless,
    I don\u2019t see why the same approach isn\u2019t valid today. You don\u2019t
    have to create a meticulously subtle and professional masterpiece at your \uFB01rst
    attempt.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of basing your design on your own drawing or writing
    is authenticity. Cut and paste is a terribly banal thing if used without discretion,
    and discretion is something that must be acquired. There are a lot of hand-drawn
    types, of varying degrees of \uFB01nish, that are quite popular and useful. Some
    of them have an idea about letterform, such as those skinny affairs where the
    lower case descenders don\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
