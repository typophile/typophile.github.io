  more marketing material we are thinking of introducing another typeface into the
  mix. Currently on the website we use Metabold for most of our headers. Everything
  else is Lucida Grande except our logotype which is Museo. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nAlso
  I help out the non-web side of the company with print collateral and sometimes have
  presentations to put together. For these I'll use Metabold still but am looking
  for a good typeface in place of Lucida to go with it. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Thanks. Also, if anyone has any standard typefaces that come on a mac that
    would be great. Like I said we're a start up so not sure what the budget for this
    is :/ All ideas welcome though!
