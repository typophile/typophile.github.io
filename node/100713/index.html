  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello,
Creative Director here tasked with coming up with a logo for a very long newly merged company. The company name is North American Home Furnishings Association- do you go with an acronym NAHFA? Or do you attempt something with the entire name spelled out? Or both? All of the companies involved in the new company previously had some sort of acronym in their logos, NHFA, HFIA, WHFA. 

And if designing using acronym - any design tips for something long and awkward?</div>

Sorry but I've got to disagree with you. "CBS" is an acronym, but that didn't stop them from having a great logo.  Other acronym companies include ABC, NBC, KFC, AT&T, NASA, and a gazillion others, and many of them have excellent logos. 

Come up with an elegant symbol that graphically represents what the organization does. (Yeah, I know, easier said than done. :)

Since "NAHFA" is an unfamiliar acronym to the general public, you'll probably need to spell out the full name in small type below or beside the logo. I'd suggest breaking the long name into multiple lines, and maybe you can get away with abbreviating "association".

As for the symbol itself, I'd start with research and make a collection of logos (both good and bad) from other organizations in similar lines of business. Obviously you don't want to copy anyone, but it may help give you ideas, help you see what works and what doesn't, and will help to prevent you from accidentally coming too close to an existing logo.

because it's a five letter acronym, not just an acronym.

the first thing i would think is to use a san serif, to reduce the complexity.

then be further reductive, by reducing, and joining the letter forms. a bit like the old nasa logo.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Five letters isn't a long name, and it's no more senseless (to use the OP's term) than many other company acronym names. 

GEICO — Government Employees Insurance Company
AFLAC — American Family Life Assurance Company
QUANTAS — Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services

And in fact, some companies use names that are totally made-up or are deliberately misspelled. For example, "Google" is a deliberate misspelling of "Googol", and for all practical purposes is a nonsense word, but things have worked out pretty well for them.

I know it can be easier if the company name is more descriptive, but I'm just saying that lots of companies face this challenge.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe it would be helpful to step back and re-frame the problem. Instead of asking "how can I deal with the length of this name aesthetically?" ask yourself "how can I communicate the identity of this organization in a way that is effective for the target audience?" An effective solution will depend a lot more on the impression you are trying to make than on some universal idea of what looks nice. Ask the visionaries in the company why the name must be exactly that to effectively communicate who they are. 

As for acronyms in general, unless they spell something memorable (but not necessarily a real word), you can always throw a bunch of money into marketing to make it remembered. The trouble usually comes when companies don't have the budget, marketing team, or insight to make this work. I think Paul Rand has more insight into this than Lubalin. But remember that he worked with huge corporations who assumed they would spend millions on marketing to make their brand recognizable. So he said:

“It is only by association with a product, a service, a business, or a corporation that a logo takes on any real meaning. It derives its meaning and usefulness from the quality of that which it symbolizes.”

“A logo is less important than the product it signifies; what it means is more important that what it looks like.”</div>
