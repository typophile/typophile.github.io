body: "I'm in the very early stages of trying to learn python. Of course, I\u2019m
  most interested in using Python to script FontLab. However, I find the documentation
  on how Python works with the Fontlab methods to be extremely sparse. I\u2019m familiar
  with this [[http://www.e-font.de/flpydoc/]] but that doesn't make much sense to
  me right now. I've also worked with Robofab a little. I\u2019m sure it will click
  as I learn more about Python but right now I\u2019m not much further than learning
  about strings, lists, and loops.\r\n\r\nAnyway\u2026 I keep hitting a dead end on
  something that I\u2019m sure is pretty simple\u2026\r\nI frequently save my progress
  as I\u2019m designing by copying my outlines to the mask layer and shifting the
  entire mask layer to the left (-1200 units at 2048 UPM). I have an Action Set saved
  for this that works by shifting outline & mask -1200 then shifting just the outline
  back 1200. I would like to do this with just a keyboard shortcut so I explored ways
  of making it happen with a Python script but I could never find a way to act on
  the mask layer in either the built-in FontLab methods or Robofab.\r\n\r\nAny help
  on this would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJosh"

    you become so well versed in scripting FontLab with Python?\r\n\r\nI'm going to
    keep studying and someday, hopefully, I\u2019ll be skilled enough to solve my
    own problems\u2026\r\nThanks again!"
