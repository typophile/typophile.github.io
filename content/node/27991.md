  by my predecessor at the company I now work for...\r\n\r\nI print brochure that
  was done on a Mac, making extensive use of the font Latiara. We don't have this
  font anywhere inhouse, and all I've been able to find online is a free downloadable
  zip that has nothing but a faulty bmap font and blank text file.\r\n\r\nMost font
  stores don't even have a listing for it... anyone know where I can find this thing?\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/latiara_3567.jpg]"
