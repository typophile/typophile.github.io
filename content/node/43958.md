body: "Is it possible to use (and have access to) the reserved 8-bit slots (especially
  decimal 129, 141, 142, 143, 144, 157) in a PS Type 1 flavored OTF font?\r\n\r\nFor
  \"reserved slots\" see http://www.sanskritweb.net/fonts/howto.pdf\r\n\r\nI need
  these reserved slots for a few additional glyphs of a private custom-made Devanagari
  font for 8-bit-encoded huge megabyte files of Sanskrit texts, for which the very
  complicated Devanagari sorting programs were written by me for 8-bit encoded text
  files only.\r\n\r\nI would prefer here PS Type 1 flavored OTF (instead of TrueType)
  for ease and fastness of hinting of the Devanagari glyphs."
