  body: "Nice idea, not overly original but just right for the task. Definitely better
    the path aligned with the byline. But maybe you could redraw it with the new proportions
    instead of just cutting it.\r\n"

    seems unresolved.

    just too tired.\r\n@litera I experimented in a previous mockup but will revisit
    this idea.\r\n@elison I think you are on to something, Maybe I can redraw the
    Apex of the /A/ to come to a point.\r\n\r\nThanks guys"

  body: Here is the logo reworked just a bit. I redrew the path so it wasn't as harshly
    cut off and I also did one version with a pointed apex. I am still working on
    a pairing for the sans serif, anyone have any recommendations? What do you guys
    think?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/veljovic-bold_3742.jpg]

  body: I think the horizontal chamfer of the /A/ is okay to keep (it actually has
    a sort of rhyme with the "eaves" of the roof), but I would experiment with making
    it align horizontally with the roof peak.

  body: The edge of the path looks awfly sharp at the bottom right, maybe make it
    less accute?  Also, moving the A to the left a bit to align with the roof peak
    will make it feel more centered, and the 'center of gravity' of the letter will
    sit more centered on the house as well.  I would also still explore a complimentery
    sans serif for the subtitle.  Sorry if I am basically repeating what others said!

    place. you a lot going with the font and house.
