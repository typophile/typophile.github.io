  how easy this software is to use (so far).  One of the elements of the 'code' is
  to replace all the glyphs with alternates, including the 'carriage return' or 'enter'.
  \ So far, I haven't found a way, and wondering if it is even possible.\r\n\r\nIn
  application, I would simply take recognizable test, and within other applications,
  change the font to the 'code' font.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts or help to this novice would
  be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nKind regards ..."
