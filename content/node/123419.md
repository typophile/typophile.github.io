body: just came out with an idea who stand up for Comic Sans that judged as the world
  ugliest (famous) font with abundant inappropiate using.

    its uses but it should be limited to those. In a perfect world, we would have
    laws mandating its permitted use with enormous financial penalties for inappropriate
    use or perhaps even prison time. \r\n\r\nThere are certainly fonts that are far
    uglier which have also been used inappropriately, but that's just my opinion.
    There are also fonts that are technically well made and otherwise inoffensive
    that others consider ugly. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In my opinion, in a perfect world, the First Amendment would be the law of
    the land in every nation. This would mitigate against penalties for inappropriate
    use of Comic Sans. Thus, the rule <em>de gustibus non disputandum</em>, usually
    translated as \"there is no accounting for taste\", should continue to hold.\r\n\r\nThis,
    of course, does not change the fact that in a <em>perfect</em> world, no one would
    be <em>tempted</em> to misuse Comic Sans. Maybe Microsoft would license an appropriate
    typeface from Comicraft to include with Windows that would replace it for the
    uses to which it is not suited.\r\n\r\nOh, wait a moment. In a <strong>perfect</strong>
    world, we wouldn't be <em>using</em> Microsoft Windows on our computers.\r\n\r\nBut
    I do think it's excessive to praise Helvetica as the world's \"most beautiful\"
    typeface. It <em>is</em> a beautiful one that nears perfection. But it's still
    excessive to praise Helvetica, Times Roman, Baskerville, Garamond, or even Eusebius,
    Centaur, or Doves in that respect. There are too many typefaces out there that
    are beautiful and near perfection to single out just one as standing above all
    the others."

    love it, but as others have mentioned the problem is that it's used inappropriately.\r\n\r\nI
    like Helvetica and use it all the time (some of my clients use it as a corporate
    font), but you need to be careful as it was heavily used a few decades ago and
    work can look dated if you're not careful, especially using the heavier weights.
    For heads I try to stick to lighter and/or condensed."

  body: "\u201CHelvetica is neutral\u201D is a myth, to be sure.\r\n\r\nSome people
    doubtless think it the most beautiful. I don\u2019t share that view, and I think
    those who do are a minority among typographers and even among designers in general,
    but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Still, Helvetica\u2019s biggest fans
    should be aware that plenty of other typefaces are at least as likely to win a
    beauty competition."

      slightly off-topic, but there\u2019s also a risk of being called \u201Ctype

      pleases me a lot more than the Linotype ver). \u201CLike, way to go, identify

  body: "<cite>\u201Cit\u2019s the most neutral typeface that doesn\u2019t interfere
    with the conveyance of content\u201D</cite>\r\n\r\nDepends on the content. I agree
    that this is \"nonsense\" in one way: Helvetica isn't even a particularly good
    text typeface. Univers is much better for that purpose if one must use a sans-serif.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    Helvetica Medium does get overused for signage for a reason. In that sphere, it
    is what people are used to, what they don't notice, what is invisible as a typeface.
    That, though, is clearly culturally based - a consequence of exposure to current
    fashions in typefaces.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with such comments is that they're
    dated. Extravagant praise of Helvetica was warranted when it first came out, as
    it gave the typographer something that just wasn't provided by previous sans-serif
    typefaces, whether of American or European origin. Today, though, its lessons
    have been fully assimilated by designers of sans-serif faces, and so many alternatives
    exist."
