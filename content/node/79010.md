  lack the skills and knowledge to be effective in the real world.\r\n\r\nRevising
  graphic design program. I would like to know what you think.\r\n\r\nPlease take
  just a few minutes to answer several questions on this PDF:\r\n[[http://smithcommunicationsllc.com/design_curriculum_survey.pdf]]\r\n"

  body: "Some quick thoughts:\r\n\r\nAll questions are of a rather technical nature,
    what about subjects such as: conceptual work, creative thinking etc. + business
    skills.\r\nIt seems to me that almost anyone can learn a piece of software or
    make himself familiar with the technical aspects of a designers work. Surely,
    no designer has ever been hired because he can use ex. Indesign - it is more a
    given.\r\n\r\nPlus, create an online form if you really want feedback on your
    individual questions. The whole PDF / Submit(t) doesn't work.\r\nhttp://polldaddy.com/
    is a good place for this.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "> It seems to me that almost anyone \r\n> can learn a piece of software...\r\n\r\nMost
    of the young people I've interviewed have decent software skills but are lacking
    in conceptual and communication skills. It's amazing how many resumes have typos
    and are poorly written, for example."

  body: "Make it project-based. \r\n\r\nChange minor requirements a few times in the
    middle of each project. \r\n\r\nInclude a round of feedback where changes are
    required without any rational reasoning.\r\n\r\nStart each project with a brief.
    Have the students right a de-brief after hearing about the context of the project.\r\n\r\nHave
    them present their concept BEFORE they begin designing. \r\n\r\nAttach a grade
    to their professionalism during the process.\r\n\r\nHave them report their time
    as they work and include it with project documentation. Give them a budget (of
    time) to stay within. \r\n\r\nEvery project should be presented formally, in person,
    with a slide-based presentation.\r\n\r\nAttach a grade to how well they matched
    their original concept and target audience. \r\n\r\nTeach them to edit a portfolio
    to only their best work.\r\n\r\nIf you can manage to do that, regardless of the
    technical details of the program, they will come out expecting real life, rather
    than lab-conditions. "

  body: "I agree with this and see too many would-be designers lacking conceptual/foundational/historical/ethical
    knowledge hit and miss at the simplest projects, that I often find the job better
    done myself when it comes to the important stuff.\r\n\r\nand, the youngins' always
    demonstrate the worst refinement in written and oft verbal communication, too."

    anything, and when I tried saving the PDF to my desktop all my answers were lost.
