  then looked all through FontShop's latest big yellow book Sans section but couldn't
  match it. I suspect it was likely a privately commissioned typeface from Ford, but
  wanted to run it by the experts here to see if anyone could match it to a known
  available font before telling my client it would need to be hand-drawn. Or failing
  that, if anyone could suggest something very close, if it comes to that. Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RPM-Gauge-cropped_4877.jpg]"
