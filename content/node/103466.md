  body: "I agree with Nick.\r\nAlso, consider the size of the letters. I can't see
    a letterpress machine with huge fonts in a battle zone in WWII.\r\nOn the other
    hand, I expect that some soldiers had sign writing/showcard experience could have
    whipped this up. Many took pride in the regularity of their lettering. They would
    use many sources as their models. The lettering is a pastiche of easy to draw
    styles of the era.\r\nThe F in \"Fighting\" is interesting. A source font?\r\nDon"
