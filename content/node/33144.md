  body: 'Is this for branding or device/UI work, or both? I''m guessing that this
    is not for straight-up branding work otherwise your creative agency would have
    given you a half dozen names. So assuming there''s a device/UI/software angle
    maybe Monotype Imaging would be a good bet. I have a lot of respect for the engineers
    and designers working out of their Palo Alto office.  '
