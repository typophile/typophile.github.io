body: "Are you looking for the Renaissance Venetian Printer [[Aldus Manutius]]?*\r\n\r\nThis
  is the wiki-entry for [[Hermann Zapf]]'s typeface <strong>Aldus</strong>\r\n\r\nHermann
  Zapf designed Aldus during the 1950s for [[D. Stempel AG]] and [[Linotype]]. Aldus
  was a typeface optimized for book text setting, based on Zapf's 1950 release, [[Palatino]].\r\n\r\nA
  digital version of Aldus is available from Linotype, Adobe, and their partners.\r\n\r\nIn
  2005, Hermann Zapf released an OpenType revision and extension of his entire Palatino
  family, named [[Palatino nova]]. A new and improved digital Aldus is included, fittingly
  named [[Aldus nova]].\r\n\r\nSee the [[Palatino]] thread for more information.\r\n\r\nView
  <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/109957/aldusnova-family.html\">Aldus nova on the
  Linotype website</a>.\r\n\r\n* Aldus is not a revival of types commissioned by Aldus
  Manutius. Rather, it is drawn in a general Italian Renaissance style and named in
  honor of his contribution to the world's typographic development."
