  body: I&#39;m sure that most typophile regulars read the article when I posted a
    link to it back in July. What may be of more interest is the response from the
    slashdot faithful...  <BR> <BR><a href="http://science.slashdot.org/science/04/09/02/0213247.shtml?tid=134&amp;tid=1"

  body: oops, sorry Simon. <BR> <BR>I did a search before posting here, but with a
    typo. <BR> <BR>Now I have to find something really new and interesting to post
    here.

    <BR>&#62; This got slashdotted!? The idea of recognizing words by &#34;word shape&#34;
    seems so silly to me that I almost feel as if the author is attacking a straw
    man rather than a widely accepted linguistic theory. <BR> <BR>&#62;He ate a HAMSTER??
    <BR> <BR>&#62;I found myself becoming aware of how I read while I read. Fun! I
    agree with the author regarding letter recognition. The parallel aspect of word
    recognition is very interesting as well because it begins to explain why we are
    albe ot raed srcambled txet os eaisly! <BR> <BR>&#62;Strange tidbit of knowledge:
    I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s impossible to read in a dream -- that words will
    always look like gibberish when you&#39;re in a dream. Well, I am fluent in Mandarin
    Chinese, and can read and write it quite well -- even when I dream. The characters
    don&#39;t look like gibberish when I dream; they&#39;re very clear and readable.
    <BR> <BR>The link has generated quite a bit of positive feedback and the readers
    have pointed out a few typos too, which is nice. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si'

  body: '&#62;&#62; The idea of recognizing words by &#34;word shape&#34; seems so
    silly to me <BR> <BR>That&#39;s only because he hasn&#39;t studied reading. It
    surprised me too when I found out, but an open mind and much research and introspection
    leads directly to the conclusion that the parallel letterwise model simply can&#39;t
    be a true representation of reading, in the full sense of the word. <BR> <BR>In
    Thessaloniki this year Peter Enneson and I both explained -in very different ways-
    why the letterwise model is deficient. Which doesn&#39;t mean the word-shape model
    is perfect, in fact it&#39;s pretty dumb. The key is boumas, which are clusters
    of letters that are recognized as wholes due to their frequency and notan distinctiveness;
    a bouma can be a word, and it can also be a single letter. <BR> <BR>Soon enough
    I will write an essay putting the letterwise model in its place - firmly in the
    fovea, which is less than half of reading. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; I am fluent in
    Mandarin Chinese, and can read <BR>&#62;&#62; and write it quite well -- even

    end up as an article in a type magazine first, <BR>but I&#39;ll make sure it gets
    to be a public PDF eventually. <BR> <BR>hhp
