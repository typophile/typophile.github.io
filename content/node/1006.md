    target="_blank"> Agenda</a> <BR>Cross-bar of E is at same height as R, not so
    in the  <BR>sample. Also, angle of outer legs of M is wrong. <BR> <BR>I was thinking
    something more along the lines of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/metro-2/metromedium-two/testdrive.html?s=MERIVA&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> Metro</a>  <BR>&#40;although Bitstream&#39;s version <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-415/medium/testdrive.html?s=MERIVA&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> Geometric 415</a> is even  <BR>closer&#41;. Customizing would
    then have included chopping  <BR>off the points of A and M that extend above cap-height  <BR>and
    below baseline, and making angles at the ends of  <BR>the top and bottom bar of
    the E. <BR>'

    I still think this is one  <BR>butt-ugly face. I always hated it when i saw it
