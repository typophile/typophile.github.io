  body: "I think it is a custom design, as most logos are. The closest techno font
    I could find at MyFonts was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/xirod/|Xirod]],
    by Ray Larabie. You could use an inverted U to get a similar N, and flip it for
    the V. It would be a starting point, if you didn't want to redraw everything.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hey Mike,\r\n\r\nYeah, I was pretty certain it would be a fairly customized
    version of something. My own searches through the techno fonts led to faces that
    were either too square or too rounded, and it was the combination in the logo
    that caught my eye. Thanks so much for the suggestion of Xirod, and the tips on
    the individual letter forms. It will definitely make an excellent starting point.\r\n\r\nLaura"
