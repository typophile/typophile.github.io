  body: It actually surprises me that Herman Miller would use a font rather than a
    custom designed logo since he&#39;s so much about design, but looking at the web
    site it definitely looks like Meta to me.

  body: After I read your post, Patricia, I did a little digging. Herman Miller hasn&#39;t
    been a &#34;he&#34; since the 1920s. And even then, Mr. Miller was just the titular
    head. <BR> <BR>&#40;You learn darnedest things on the Internet!&#41; <BR> <BR><a

  body: Well I didn&#39;t mean Herman Miller the person as much as Herman Miller the
    company. I assume he&#39;s long dead. But I&#39;d have thought they&#39;d have
    a more original logo given they&#39;re a design company.

    cool furniture manufacturer amused me.
