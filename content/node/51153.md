  body: "I think some customization is at work here, and not just the reversed 's'.
    The 'fi' ligature seems unlike any Roman ligature I can think of, and the second
    'i' is an upper case letter. I thought perhaps a Baskerville might be a starting
    point, but the 's' would also need to be modified to reduce the serif. I'm afraid
    when it comes to logos, anything goes, and it is hard to guess whether any of
    it is unedited.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
