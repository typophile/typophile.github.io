body: "I recently needed to recreate some lettering on some 1970s electronic studio
  equipment, but could not for love or money identify the typeface used in the equipment
  name/logo. I've since recreated the letters I needed, about 20 in all, but I'd still
  like to know if one of you might identify it for me.\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/flange_0.png\">\r\nIf
  this has never been digitized I might be interested in finishing what I have already
  started and putting it out there as a revival font. See what you think."

  body: "Thanks, Dick.\r\n\r\nThe page at abfonts you linked to says the following:
    \"Cutin\" is Cut-in Medium on page 163 of The Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display
    Typefaces. Apparently \"Cut-In\" was released by Letraset in at least Medium and
    Bold weights. So at least now I have a name\u2013but no information on a designer.\r\n\r\nThe
    font called \"Simplement\" that you linked seems to be a pretty nicely done digitization
    of the Medium weight, updated with additional characters and most common diacritics,
    though there are no kerning pairs. I wonder why this one has slipped though the
    cracks in terms of digitization and release. I'm not going to go searching for
    a complete source of now, but this might be one to keep on the backburner for
    later consideration. Might be nice to see a good rendition of the family. Perhaps
    Old Nick will give it a go."

  body: "Your letters seem to match Cutin Bold by Letraset. The character-set is shown
    in the old Letraset Product Manual for 1985, and probably for other years. Just
    the upper and lower case [multiple versions of _C_ (5), _E_ (5), _S_ (2), _c_
    (6), _e_ (4), _s_ (2), _y_ (2), and _z_ (2)], numbers, German double s [\xDF and
    ss], ampersand, dollar [simplified from regular], pound, and basic punctuation.\r\nDon"

    luck so far.

    where and how to spend his efforts based on interesting ideas. He can be found
    on alt. binaries.fonts forum.\r\n\r\nMy understanding Character digitized Cutin
    from images provided by Claude so perhaps you could ask him directly."
