  body: It is similar &#40;aren&#39;t they all&#41; to a font called China, which
    I only know in digital form as the FontBank font called <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/chimes.htm"
    target="_blank">Chimes</a>. You use the U to make the N, or an alternate A, and
    you can recreate 70% of these bleeping &#39;Tech&#39; fonts. Square off a corner
    here or there; take a notch out here or there, who could tell? Use Eurostile for
    the rest. Aarghh, I&#39;ll be glad when this look finally goes out of style! &#40;Sorry
    for the outburst, I&#39;ll be better in a while.&#41;

  body: <i>With apologies to Mike. :-&#41;</i> <BR> <BR>No, Mark, the apologies should
    be mine -- I should have recommended Changeling, and would have, if I had known
    about it. You have several of the alternate letterforms already made, and the
    variety of weights certainly makes it more versatile. <BR> <BR>That geometric
    style fits well with much of your retro repertoire, and in fact I group the square
    tech look in with the Bauhaus-style geometric fonts in my Bauhaus-style Font ID
    Guide. The simplicity of the tech look seems in keeping &#40;to me&#41; with the
    Bauhaus principles of reducing type to simpler forms.  I just get ill over the
    clich

  body: No apologies please. I actually had a good laugh this morning with that outburst
    - I couldn&#39;t agree more. Well, I took your tip and used Eurostile Bold Exteded
    2 and recreated the logo. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Julie
