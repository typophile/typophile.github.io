  this post but nothing of assistance came up. So I am asking once more ...\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know if and where I can obtain a copy of the iKern application? I saw on
  <a href=\"http://www.iginomarini.com/ikern.html\">http://www.iginomarini.com/ikern.html</a>
  that the application is available for purchase but, as someone else noted in another
  post, Mr. Marini's contact information don't seem to work.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I
  downloaded the DTL Font Master Light Suite but I saw that the autospacing feature
  in the KernMaster application doesn't work on this version of the software (as it
  says). Is this actually the case or did I do something wrong?"
