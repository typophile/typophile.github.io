  visitor on the whatthefont forums, but even though it gets ID'd nobody can ever
  provide a link to buy/download it. It's been digitized but here's no standard font
  file for it anywhere online.\r\n\r\nBasically only two companies seem tied to it:
  Gerber makes some sort of cutter (vinyl? fabric?) and the font (under the name Marker
  Acct) comes with the cutter software. Another company (Silver Graphics) apparently
  had something to do with it, but I never saw a page where one could buy it. Maybe
  they made it for Gerber. They apparently went under, their website hadn't been updated
  in 10 years, but someone claimed they were coming back. I can't find evidence of
  this, there are several companies by that name if you Google it. Who knows?\r\n\r\nSo
  if I got my hands on an old PDF with outlines of the letters, imported it into fontlab
  and saved a TTF/OTF file, am I breaking the law? I'm aware American font laws are
  notoriously lax here anyway. What if I've added various glyphs? ---> EG @ & \u20AC?\r\n\r\nIf
  that's not legal, would manually retracing the glyphs make it legal? To be honest
  that seems silly, it's reinventing the wheel... the PDF's characters are perfect.
  It seems disingenuous to nudge a few nodes here and there and pretend I've now made
  a new font. \r\n\r\nLastly, legal questions aside, does anyone have an objection
  to it ethically?\r\nI feel the font is basically abandonware. Someone might technically
  hold the rights to it, but they don't sell it. Nobody's gonna buy a multi-thousand
  dollar machine just to get it. Nobody can name the original creator, and of course
  whoever made the font for Gerber copied someone else, it's at least 40-50 years
  old. If you think it's ok to release it, would your stance change if I sold it vs.
  making it free?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sanfordexample_5186.jpg]"

    Don't put yourself in a situation where the font ends up on hundreds of free font
    sites and you have no way to take it down. If you were to distribute it from your
    own site with a copyright notice that explained that the font can only be distributed
    from that site, at least you'd be able to easily comply with a C&D letter by taking
    it down from your site. You don't want to be in a position where you have to request
    font removal from hundreds of free font sites: trust me.\r\n\r\nThat also allows
    you to ensure the documentation stays with the font. Many free font sites remove
    the license agreement from the zip or distribute unzipped fonts."

  body: 'My understanding is that extracting font outlines from a PDF is clearly illegal,
    but that''s perhaps only true if the font has registered protection such as a
    copyright as software or design patent. It would seem though that you have a case
    that this font isn''t protected (probably never was) and is abandoned property
    or unclaimed work which would make extracting the outlines OK as fair use of works
    in the public domain. I think Ray Larabie has given some great advice to assume
    that is not the case and proceed with caution. '

  body: "<em>am I breaking the law?</em>\r\n\r\nTechnically, probably not: the beziers
    themselves are simply data, which is not copyright-protected--or, so it would
    seem in the wake of several other discussions in these fora on the subject. However,
    there is, indeed, an ethical problem if you claim the work as your own and/or
    profit from it. But, if you intend it to be freeware and the abandonment issues
    you raised are true, then you can probably sleep well at night, and the cheap
    bastards who never bought a font in their sorry lives--and never will--will thank
    you and sing your praises...and ask you for free technical support if the font
    doesn't perform to their expectations."

  body: "I would have noted the font's origins and tried to stress I didn't make the
    glyphs... But of course once it spreads online, that sort of useless gesture becomes
    moot. A million sites will provide just the TTF file.\r\n\r\nAlso it's come to
    my attention since that the Silver Graphics font does exist as a standard TTF
    and really was sold at some point, maybe as part of a package CD. Maybe they got
    a gerber cutter and saw the font software, and their eyes turned into dollar signs.\r\n\r\nI'm
    thinking I'll keep my version to myself and maybe share with a friend or two who
    won't redistribute it (naive I know), while the silver graphics version is off
    limits.\r\n\r\nThanks for your input everyone."
