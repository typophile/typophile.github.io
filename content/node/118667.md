  body: "Thank you for your suggestion!\r\n\r\nYes, Vafle Condensed is somewhat similiar
    - \r\n\r\nthough the letters are generally wider than in the attached file.\r\n\r\nIn
    the attached file, the \"b\" and \"o\" are more narrow and less rounded/more square.\r\n\r\nAny
    other suggestions for a font that matches the enclosed file..?\r\n\r\n"

    body: I found out that the font in question is called [[http://www.onestarpress.com/BOOKMACHINEPARIS/TYPO_BMP/PDF/weiner_typo.pdf|Margaret
      Seaworthy Gothic]]. It was drawn when [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Weiner|Lawrence
      Weiner]] didn't want to use an off-the-shelf typeface for his "sculptures" (as
      he calls them). Other similar typefaces are [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/refrigerator-deluxe/|Refrigerator
      Deluxe]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/mandatory/|Mandatory]].
