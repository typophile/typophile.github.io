  body: "I worked for a vendor to Diageo for over five years and during that time
    attempted numerous times to identify a font which would match the Baileys logo.
    I was never able to find one so I'm assuming it was a hand-lettered graphic.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the other brands owned by Diageo have their own proprietary fonts, which were
    furnished to us for the work we did, but there was never one for Baileys."
