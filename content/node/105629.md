  rather than catching those make them available in the first place. There is a website
  dedicated to providing free Helvetica and Gotham fonts, why dont they do something
  about that rather than catching some lone, broke designer. Yeah it is illegal but
  doing something about it is ineffective and inefficient. Why not just try stopping
  the websites that distribute these fonts for free. Maybe you will scare some people
  who use these fonts but that is it about it. You just wasted a whole lot of time
  pursuing one offender and what are you gonna get out of it ? Pretty much nothing.
  So why not try to cut off the root of this problem. \r\n \r\nAnd just so it is known,
  I appreciate the time and hard work type designers  put into typefaces but why not
  try better ways to protect your rights. What do you guys think? Any suggestions
  on how to stop this. "

    standard typeface, yet (56 years after its design!) it is proprietary.\r\n\r\nCan
    one design a font to seriously compete with Helvetica without being taken to court
    for \"copying\" Helvetica? In other words, you want it to be enough like Helvetica
    to work in the same sort of places people use Helvetica, but not be too much like
    Helvetica, because then that would be stealing.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you're going
    to steal a font, at least steal one in which capital I and lowercase l don't collide.
    (Who was Kim Jong the Second?) And while you're at it, check that the digit 6
    is not a wannabe 8."

    purely economics. Graphic designers and their clients are infinitely more likely
    to cough up some fees compared to the operators of the off-shore warez site, especially
    if the alternative is damage to their reputation or the threat of a law-suit. "
