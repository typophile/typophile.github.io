body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to identify all the typefaces used in John Carpenter\u2019s
  \"They Live\" from 1988.\r\n\r\nMost of them is Futura, but I am struggling with
  one particular shot: The money which says \"This is your god\" \u2026\r\nThe G doesn\u2019t
  match any Futura I can find.\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure, it has to be some version
  of Futura, since most of the other typefaces are as well (I also found Franklin
  Gothic, a wodden letterpress typeface and a lot of hand-drawn versions of Futura
  and Century Gothic).\r\n\r\nDoes anybody has any idea what version this might be?\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much for your help, any suggestions is highly appreciated!"
