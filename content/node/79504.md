  charming and good-natured typeface.  I tried 'what the font' from myfonts.com, but
  they were far off.\r\n\r\nAnyone recognize it?  Thank you so much!!!\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "Holy moly, Dave Rowland.  They're 99.99995% identical! \r\n\r\nI made the
    following collage comparing Avenir Heavy, and upon closer scrutiny, I see that
    the a's are different, the unknown font has a more playful, youthful top curve.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the lowercase characters in relation to the uppercase are much shorter in the
    unknown, while in Avenir the lowercase characters are slightly, ever so slightly
    taller, making the font look more mature and serious.\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/1624/fontidcutesanscompare.gif\">\r\n\r\n(CLARIFICATION:
    \ Original font on top, Avenir 85 right underneath)\r\n\r\nOoooh.... (font swoon)"

  body: "Thank you, Frode Frank :)  I tried Gotham and it was just as close as Avenir.
    \ However, in either case, the swell of the closed circle in the 'a' (disclaimer:
    I know nothing about typography terminology) is slightly smaller than the original,
    unknown font.\r\n\r\nThe original's 'a' has a very rotund, almost child-like swell
    to it that's not present in Avenir or Gotham.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am EXTREMELY grateful
    for the suggestions, and will take them :)\r\n\r\nThank you two again!\r\n\r\nCaro"

  body: "There are some <em>inconsitencies.</em> The spacing is pretty bad: C|o, t|a|c|t,
    e|c|e etc. The e looks kinda unbalanced, and the t really is off. Also the weight
    issues (compare o and k) leads me to think this might be the work of an amateur.
    Your sample is very small, but it looks like the a is similar to the one in [[Mark
    Simonson]]\u2019s [[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html|Proxima
    Nova]]. In the na\xEFve sense, it does remind me a bit of [[http://fonts.gestalten.com/index.php/catalog/product/view/id/3559|Planeta]]
    by [[Dani Klauser]]. (It\u2019s kinda embarrasing that they refer to a type designer
    as a typographer, but so does the rest of the world \u2026 Yeah. Nitpicking.)
    If you know where you found it, it might help narrow things down."

  body: "Oh!  I can easily provide more samples of the font:  it's from Pixel Push
    Studio's website, at pixelpushstudio.com.\r\n\r\nI only arranged the collage here
    so as to save you guys the trip, and to make identifying the font easier.\r\n\r\nI
    actually emailed the studio myself a week ago or so (with a very polite, albeit
    shy request for font ID), but they did not reply.  I'm not even entirely sure
    if they're a running studio.\r\n\r\nI hope the link is of help.  You can clearly
    see how they use the font so charmingly. "
