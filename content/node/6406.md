body: First off, lemme start with a disclaimer. This font is not mine, I did not create
  it. Just so you know from the outset. <BR> <BR>That said, I&#39;ve been thinking
  I&#39;d like to digitize this one or at least use it as basis for something else.
  The reason I wouldn&#39;t do a straightforward digitization is that this face seems
  a bit too quirky still, perhaps the original auther would have benefited from a
  critique board like this. &#40;I think this is another of Hermann Ihlenburg&#39;s
  faces, I seem to have a thing for his work&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyhow the biggest problem,
  as i see it, and what bothers me most is that the capitals C, D, G, E, O, Q, and
  maybe even P don&#39;t really seem to fit &#40;too round&#41; and then the 8 gives
  me troubles too &#40;too square&#41;. I mean maybe Hermann was trying to mix blackletter
  with the modern style, but i don&#39;t think they meshed too well in this example.
  <BR> <BR>So i guess my basic question is, if you could change anything about the
  following face, what would it be and why? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47748.gif"

    font. <BR> <BR>&#42; Maybe in finding a new name for the &#34;adaptation&#34;.

  body: I think Dan X. Solo digitized this for one of his Dover font CD-ROMs. Aside
    from the inclusion of some particularly gorgeous designs unavailable elsewhere
    &#40;Durer Gothic, King&#39;s Cross, Church Text&#41; I remember his versions
    being rather hastily digitized. I haven&#39;t bought any of his newer work, so
    it may have improved, but there were all kinds of stroke weight inconsistencies
    that made the 24-fonts-for-$15 approach fall short. <BR> <BR>And I&#39;ve developed
    a soft spot for Art Nouveau stuff, especially the earlier, more Teutonic &amp;
    William Morris-sey lettering. So if you&#39;re going to revive and refine this
    one, I salute you. Just be sure to dig around and find some of the original alternates,
    if they exist.

  body: This sample is from the Dover Blackletter and Gothic fonts book. And I believe
    you&#39;re right about it being digitized. <BR>So I hafta dig around to see if
    i can have someone send me more scans on this one for alternates? I think there
    are a couple fonts similar to this one in the same Dover book that I&#39;ve got.
    I&#39;ll probably look at those for alternate lettershapes for the ones i&#39;m
    not particularly fond of. But am i right? do the characters i mentioned seem out
    of place? Hrant you&#39;re ablsolutely right about Ketel One. I first saw this
    font in their advertising at first i thought it was Honda, but then i took another
    look. Anyway... now i&#39;m rambling.... i&#39;ll shut up now. ;^&#41; <BR> <BR>oh
    and i just love art nouveau, victorian and deco lettering. that stuff really gets
    me goin!

  body: David Bowie said, &#34;It isn&#39;t about who does it first, but about who
    does it second.&#34; I&#39;d go for a redesign of this classic. The world needs
    more Art Nouveau fonts. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d change the original design a little bit

  body: i was looking at this one again last night and i think i figgered out what
    Hermann was doing.... maybe... <BR>He was not mixing blackletter and modern, he
    was pulling from blackletter and Lombardic cap forms. I don&#39;t think the two
    mix very well. So maybe i&#39;ll do two versions &#40;if i actually do any at
    all&#41; one more blackletter and one more lombardic. There are actually several
    old faces that look a lot like this one, i wonder if this style wasn&#39;t actually
    in vogue at one time. imagine that!

  body: i took a look at a Ketel One ad again recently and although the font they
    use is very similar to Bradley, it isn&#39;t Bradley! &#40;at least not this Bradley
    as posted above&#41; It&#39;s a bit more refined and a tad easier on the eyes.

  body: Looking inside the Flash file on the Ketel website reveals the font as &#34;KetelOne&#34;
    -- suggesting a custom job. It would still appear to be derived from Bradley.  <BR>
    <BR>There&#39;s a blurb about Bradley in the book &#34;American Type Design &amp;
    Designers,&#34; which credits the typeface to Joseph Phinney, based on lettering
    by Henry William Bradley. <BR> <BR>Finally, the reason I happened to have that
    scan of Bradley in the first place was because I had been intending to turn it
    into a font myself. I got as far as digitizing the letters in the sample, at which
    point I must have lost interest. I&#39;m happy to provide the unfinished work
    to anyone who wants to make use of it.

  body: "This Bradley was used for the american company Firestone.\r\nAnd in the very
    early 1900 it was licensed to Bauersche Giesserei in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
    They offered it under the name \"American Alt-Gotisch\". There are only a very
    few fonts from out of Germany which where accepted by the german foundries - and
    if so, most of it came out of Europe, e.g. Lettergieterij Amsterdam, Netherlands.
    So the Bradley must have been a very fine designed and a very succesful font:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/index.php?target=shop/shop_details&artikel_id=481&b=0004&pic=a\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n<a
