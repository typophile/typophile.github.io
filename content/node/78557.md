  body: "Do you have any other samples using this same script? The reason I ask that
    is that with no repeating letters it's almost impossible to tell if this is not
    hand-drawn. Besides that T, the 'a' is also rather odd-looking, so my inclination
    is to think this is not a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
