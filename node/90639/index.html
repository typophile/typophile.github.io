  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">There is a design firm in San Francisco...their website is just a white background with a single video with the founder talking about how he isn't going to post a profile, list of works, clients, etc....that if you want real design - come to them. It is a great video and a great site, sadly, I don't remember what it was or who they are...while I was trying to find it I came across some pretty nice sites and designers with nice work. I'm interested in hearing who your favorite graphic designers or firm is and possibly if anyone knows what i'm talking about with this firm in San Fran.
For now, I really like the work of this guy.

Examples?

Here are two of my favs, one of them maybe predictable the
other maybe no longer active: Marian Bantjes, Miles Newlyn.
But I admit to being largely confined to the world of type
design, so hopefully you'll get more relevant contributions.

rs - headsofstate =nice.
the video didn't say anything about trusting them blindly, but to meet them face-to-face and they would go over their work and portfolio in person. 

james - you nailed it. 

in this day and age of "everyone has a site", and certainly even my grandma can do some great photoshop work in her basement on an old dell, whether people say it is arrogant or not i'm sure is of no concern as these people aren't in their demographic. 
honestly, for me it was one of the best, if not THE best website for a designer. It really struck me. I've been a designer for 15 years and I don't have a site, nor do I carry a portfolio. The reason is the same reason - it is far too limiting. When I speak to a client I meet in person and put together a portfolio specifically catered to their needs...so with that being said, there is absolutely nothing arrogant about it.

If it's a large design firm, their clients would be mostly corporations and they wouldn't be hired without face-to-face meetings, a review of their previous work, written proposals and estimates, and so forth.

I haven't seen the video myself, but I'm guessing that the design firm targets and goes after potential clients that they desire, rather than just putting up a site and hoping it'll attract someone, and therefore they regard the website as largely a waste of resources.

A design firm I used to work for had a similar attitude. They did almost no advertising. The decided who they wanted as a client and then went after them.

Arrogant. And bad business; it's much better
to turn away people knocking at your door.

Probably the owner is an old fart who gets
more kicks out of arrogance than money.

> meet them face-to-face

So you want people to fly over to you
to see your work. What is this, 1970?

And really, do you think you're at the level
of that mythical design firm and you should
also try to avoid the unwashed masses?
Arrogant.

Seriously? 

So, <em>IF</em> that's true, I feel 'real' sad for the rest of us 'unreal' graphic designers and graphic design firm owners.

As to your 'real' question ... I appreciate designers (and design firms) that have an edge to their work and have the innate ability to push their craft/art forward with the tools that they use. It could be something slick as done by Neil Duerden, or something raw as done by Eric Haze. There's far too many for me to mention like Ian Brignell, the firm Non-Format, um ... 

But say something like "...if you want real design - come to them.", is just plain ignorant.</div>

No, normally an executive at the design firm would go to the potential client's office. Even if it means flying across the country. 

Landing a big account can means hundreds of thousands of dollars in billing, so it's worth spending some money to land the account.

At the design firm I previously mentioned working at, we had a Vice President for Marketing (although he used a different title on his business card so it didn't sound overly commercial). His only job was landing new clients, and he was constantly traveling, showing the portfolio, wining and dining executives at companies we wanted to work for, etc.

But I'm sure they also had a functional website, which helps:

eventually become your clients.

Yes, you're right; they had a nice site.

I'm just speculating that the company the original poster was talking about gets their clients by other means, such as word-of-mouth or by pursuing clients they desire. Or they prefer to pitch their services in person. 

 Just a guess; I haven't seen the website the o.p. was talking about.</div>

Also, no matter what bad things a thread may

So don't think of such contributions as helping
a single misguided individual - think of them
as helping anybody who's open to the help.

That said, it's also very important to publicly
counter bad behavior - thank you for doing so.
