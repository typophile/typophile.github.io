body: "I am attempting to pair two families of fonts for creating a vintage feeling
  of typewriter while keeping a smooth and modern composition. I like slab fonts like
  Rockwell, Archer, Klinic, Rokkitt, and I decided to try with Klinic. Of course I
  absolutely need a proportional font for the main body of text.\r\n\r\nThe idea was
  to try to pair it with some monospace font for the titles in order to increse the
  vintage feeling. I join a PDF with various combinations. My three favorites are
  headlines with \"Anonymous Pro\", \"Courier 10 Pitch\" and \"Free Mono\" (see attached
  PDF).\r\n\r\nI would like however to have your own comments; obviously some fonts
  can't pair with the slab font as well as other ones."
