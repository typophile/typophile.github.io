body: "This is my first post on Typophile... must say I really like what I've seen
  so far and I look forward to more actively participating in the community.\r\n\r\nThat
  being said, I'd like some input in picking a typeface to set a wordmark in. I'm
  an upper-division Visual Communciation Design student at Arizona State University,
  and was recently elected to our Graphic Design Student Association committee. A
  little background, GDSA is in charge of all events, programming, and fundraising
  for our undergrad program. We put on events that help get our undergrads more involved
  in the design world around them, including guest speakers, local firm visits, and
  an out-of-state winter trip each year. For fundraising, we put on various exhibitions
  including poster shows and \"studio nights,\" in which the third and fourth year
  students showcase their work. GDSA also coordinates mentor nights to help out our
  lower-division students with their studio work and offer input based on our past
  experiences with those courses.\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of our incoming committee
  was to get GDSA much more involved in student life, as it has been severely lacking
  in overall quality the past few years. We decided to rebrand ourselves to help convey
  this new, bold approach, and I'm basically art directing the process.\r\n\r\nOne
  of the icons we've come up with is simple... black circle with white Eames Century
  Modern (black) type inside spelling out GDSA. While this works well on its own,
  I'd like to have a wordmark to either appear next to it or below, or be incorporated
  into the design of the sign. I've made a few experiments on my own, but would like
  your input on the matter. Sans-serif preferred.\r\n\r\nI attached a copy of our
  sign... thanks for reading and I'm looking forward to your input.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5022/5754946355_c4958a4256_o.png\">"

    round black mark is not a bad point to start with. \r\nHowever, I wonder if the
    overall approach could be a bit more \u2013 well, inventive.\r\n\u201CGSDA\u201D
    in that fashion could be anything.\r\n"

    Grotesque]] and it looks good.\r\nOther possibilities could be Verlag, Proxima
    Nova (condensed?), or something even more geometric like Futura/Nobel/FF Super
    Grotesk.\r\n"
