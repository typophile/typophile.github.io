  body: 'Well, I got the eps logo of the team, separated the letters, cleaned them
    up, and posted them to WhatTheFont, and it didn&#39;t turn up anything. Nor did
    my wandering through MyFonts or Fontscape. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a custom
    job. No blackletter x I looked at looked remotely like this: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/7293.gif"
    alt="white sox"> <BR> <BR>Maybe someone else here has a better idea. On the other
    hand, if all you need is the logo of the team, <a href="http://www.logo.nino.ru/main/?id=20518&amp;query_id=65632&amp;page=1">here
    it is</a>.'
