  Black, bold orange, dark gray, sky blue.\r\n\r\nI have my heart set on using a flame
  somehow, but was advised that a plus sign would be more fitting. It was said to
  be 'too girly'.. \r\n\r\nI am aiming for a 'swiss' feel. \r\n\r\nThe fonts used
  on the left: Intro\r\nOn right: Trade Gothic, Bebas, then two versions of Univers.
  \r\n\r\nHOW do I make it more manly with using orange. \r\nHelp! \r\n\r\n "

    his Brothers - or Vendetta might be sufficiently brutish as well.\r\n\r\nAnother
    idea: the tail of the \"Q\" might be\r\nrendered as some sort of sharp implement.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'Thanks James, the blue will be removed. I just wanted to use the color orange,
    but because the color isn''t a dark gray/black/muted green, I wanted it to read
    as a product for men without being too kitschy. The error is in the font. Swiss
    design is clean and modern, but not meant to be rugged or ''manly''.. the font
    must stray from swiss influence. '

  body: Mariam, I wouldn't necessarily abandon the swiss look completely. It can have
    a calm, controlled look might have some relevance to a survival kit. You might
    want to present a range of concepts that include both swiss influence along with
    other looks.
