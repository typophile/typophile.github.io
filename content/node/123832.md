  to create typography letters and pixel arts based on the grids system.\r\n\r\nhttp://qcalligraphy.com/typogrid1.0/\r\n\r\nIn
  2011, I developed the first version of this web application under \"Square Kufi
  / Kufi Murabba\" name. \r\nThe concept of the app was to help users create one kind
  of arabic calligraphy which is Square Kufi using pen and eraser tools.\r\n            \r\nAt
  the end of 2014, and after feedback and further development of my vision, I developed
  a lot of concepts to created an advanced and smart tool for typographers and graphic
  designers which would help them to create typography letters and pixel arts based
  on the grids system, in a much more faster way. Thus, this web application has now
  emerged as something more than a tool to create Kufi arabic calligraphy - it has
  become a Typogrid.\r\n\r\nTechnical Features:\r\n- User-friendly interface\r\n-
  Export as SVG and PNG\r\n- Import SVG files\r\n- Compatible on iPad, Tablets and
  smart phones\r\n\r\n-\r\nQassim Haider\r\n"
