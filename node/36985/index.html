  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all, I&rsquo;m new here, so I&rsquo;m sorry if this isn&rsquo;t the kind of thing to be posting.</p>
<p>I work doing layout for a small town &lsquo;newspaper&rsquo; (more of a newsletter really), and have recently seen the following course offered near-by:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.skillpath.com/seminfo.html/st/BROCH">http://www.skillpath.com/seminfo.html/st/BROCH</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in attending it with another of the girls from work as I haven&rsquo;t had much to do with design since a couple of basic courses in Uni years ago, and the other lady hasn&rsquo;t done anything at all. The boss agreed it would be good, but then the next boss up said that they didn&rsquo;t like SkillPath as the seminars are not hands-on enough. Personally I think a 2 day design course such as this one doesn&rsquo;t need to be &lsquo;hands-on&rsquo; as such. It&rsquo;s more of a beginners course that should cover the basics and teach the theory behind design, rather than how to physically create design (which is what I think they mean by hands on).</p>
<p>The boss has asked me to put together a few reasons in dot-point as to why this course will be of value to myself and my work mate. The problem is that while I know a little about design I don&rsquo;t know enough to be able to convince someone who knows nothing that a knowledge of design is needed. I get the feeling that, like most people who are not familiar with design concepts and who have Publisher at home, they don&rsquo;t really see the value in knowledge about approriate techniques.</p>
<p>Any advice would be great, I&rsquo;m sorry for the long rambling explanation, I will try to keep any future posts short!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I followed the link you posted, and it didn&rsquo;t do much for me. It instantly reminded of &ldquo;How to burn off 20 pounds of ugly fat in just 5 days.&rdquo; &ndash; In other words, a waste of money.</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;tips the pros use&rdquo; is one tip-off. If it were a matter of &ldquo;tips,&rdquo; we&rsquo;d all be pros. Rich, too. Or the repeated phrase &ldquo;keep your readers riveted to the page.&rdquo; You keep your readers riveted to the page by the copy, not the design. Design can help organize material for a clearer presentation, but as for riveting, no, you have to go to the shipyard.</p>
<p>More seriously, If your newspaper/newsletter company is a smallish company, I can well understand the boss not wanting to pay for such a course, hands-on or not. If you are going to be with the company a number of years, they might be willing to help defray the cost of some design education, but realistically, unless you are in the advertising department (and it is more of a newspaper than a newsletter), there isn&rsquo;t much in it for them.</p>
<p>None of which should stop you from learning, at first through books, and later, if the interest is there, through formal training if you want. Depends on what you want. I&rsquo;ve always believed that school gets you your first job; how you do in that first job gets you your second job. But that&rsquo;s just jobs; education is a different matter.</p>

<p>A good &lsquo;design&rsquo; seminar that you should drag your boss to is one of the Ed Tufte seminars that he does annually around the country. A really great &lsquo;aha!&rsquo; one-day course for those in business that just haven&rsquo;t figure it out yet.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">In other words in 6 hours you will be a productive graphic designer. I went to one of their seminars once. For the $200 I heard a lot of misinformation. The weakest part of the course is the typography information. Go to the library and read a few good books so that you can diferentiate between good and bad design.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi, thank you both for your comments.</p>
<p>I looked up the Ed Tufte seminars, unfortunately though, I don&rsquo;t think the company would be keen to send me to the States for a course.</p>
<p>The company I work for is a big one and they don’t have any issues with spending the money to send us on a course, they just don’t think this one is any good. I agree with you Charles that it is a very commercial-looking course; however I think there might be some information worth listening to in there. I’m going to be away from work for 5 weeks visiting America (so maybe I could catch an Ed Tufte course after all… ) and my work mate will be taking over doing the “Gibber”. Here’s a copy of the Gibber from last year, before I took over the job:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woomera.com.au/community/gibber_gabber/2006/10_Nov_06.pdf">http://www.woomera.com.au/community/gibber_gabber/2006/10_Nov_06.pdf</a></p>
<p>My friend was doing the Gibbers back then and she did a great job, especially since she had no formal training at any level, and I believe the lady filling in for me will be the same. You’ll probably notice a few mistakes in there that are obvious if you know what you’re looking for and it’s those sort of things that I’m hoping this course will help us with. As I said it’s the basic stuff we’re hoping to get from the course.</p>
<p>Which books would you recommend? I did a super basic desktop design course when I went to Uni in 2002 I think, but it was a basic course, mandatory for all of the multi-media students (I was keen on computer animation back in those days) but I enjoyed it and I do love putting the Gibber together and find design interesting.</p>
<p>If your curious here is one of my most recent editions (still with a lot of the same basic flaws, but I think I’ve been able to use some of what I remember from Uni to bring the look up a bit).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woomera.com.au/community/gibber_gabber/2007/31_Aug_07.pdf">http://www.woomera.com.au/community/gibber_gabber/2007/31_Aug_07.pdf</a></p>
<p>Any and all advice on how to improve the Gibber are more than welcome too!</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Amber</p>

<p>Here are some books you may want to check out:</p>
<p>On newspaper design:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Contemporary-Newspaper-Design-Typography-Newsprint/dp/0972424032/ref=sr_1_1/104-0871536-9538369?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189571650&sr=1-1"><em>Contemporary Newspaper Design</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Editing-Design-Designers-Directors-Editors/dp/1581153023/ref=sr_1_2/104-0871536-9538369?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189572467&sr=1-2"><em>Editing by Design</em></a> (This is a 2003 edition&hellip; There are also older editions, as far back as 1974&rsquo;s, going for very little money.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0275924645/ref=s9_asin_title_3/104-0871536-9538369?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=14857BGWBCQTJH2J0GCZ&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=288448401&pf_rd_i=507846"><em>Elements of Newspaper Design</em></a> (Don&rsquo;t know this one&hellip; Just found it on Amazon.)</p>
<p>On grids:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Breaking-Grid-Graphic-Workshop/dp/1592531253/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-0871536-9538369?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189570580&sr=1-1"><em>Making and Breaking the Grid</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grids-Structure-Graphic-Andre-Jute/dp/0823065480/ref=sr_1_9/104-0871536-9538369?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189570283&sr=1-9"><em>Grids: The Structure of Graphic Design</em></a> (a little pricey on the U.S. Amazon, I admit &ndash; maybe it&rsquo;s out of print)</p>
<p>As to your own work, I like the new logo and the use of a serif face for the body text. However, beware of setting body copy across the entire width of a page&hellip; The usual advice given is that a column of text becomes uncomfortable to read if you go beyond 10-12 words per line.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with Darrel. Buy Tufte&rsquo;s books. You will probably learn more from starting with a couple of books and then do a course. That way you will know a bit more of what to look for/which sort of course would be best for you.</p>
<p>You should get Robert Bringhurst&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Elements of typographic styles&rdquo;. Though no beginners book it is a great source for looking up information and by many considered somewhat of a bible for typography.</p>
<p>One book great to start with would be &ldquo;stop stealing sheep&rdquo; by Erik Spiekerman. It will get you started.</p>
