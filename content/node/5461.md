  body: I think it a custom font &#40;or modification&#41; made to have serifs that
    imitate Chinese calligraphy. I think the bad news for you is  that Disney has
    a design staff that includes enough typographic talent to handle their needs,
    even though there are times I think they use stock fonts &#40;or barely modified
    ones&#41;.
