  type from Bodoni's Manuale typographico (any version).\r\ni know that there is a
  beautiful new book by Taschen, that i would like get my gritty hands on.\r\n\r\nanyway
  - my request is if you have that book (and a scanner, and some spare time, and willingness)\r\nplease
  scan some good quality images of the hebrew types in that book (i'm attaching a
  sample of the only image i have).\r\n(i attached it in also full scale)\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q6Q9241_4636.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Q6Q9241_4719.jpg]"
