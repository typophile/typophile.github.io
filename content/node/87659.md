body: "Guys, I have been working with the illustrator pen tool, and have noticed that
  while drawing a new point the entire path disappears until I release the mouse button
  ( placing the new anchor ). \r\n\r\nIs there a way to see the entire drawn path
  while placing new points so I can see where my anchor is in relation to the form?
  \r\n\r\nI know this may be a tad confusing. Please let me know if you understand
  or if I need further clarification..."

    just place all of the extrema points on your path as straight segments and then
    option-drag the curves into place."

  body: 'Ya, that''s been my solution as of now, just wondering if there was a faster
    way. I guess setting a black stroke to .25 and using that as your path is similar.
    Thanks! '

  body: "Justin,\r\n\r\nmaybe I did not understood your question, but IL always show
    what you are drawing while you click and hold down the mouse button (I mean, while
    placing a new anchor but before the button release).\r\n\r\nBut it shows just
    the resulting object. Thus, if you are drawing with no stroke/fill, IL will show
    just the segment under edition using the color of the layer active.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you want to see the resulting object while moving the cursor and before a mouse
    click. This is not done by IL as the app does not know if the user plan to make
    the segment straight or curve. When working with a <em>specific</em> tool (as
    arc) this is shown as the resulting path is determined by the mouse position."
