  there were four American type foundries that were truly top notch. \r\n\r\nHe listed
  Font Bureau, House Industries, H&FJ, and Emigre, and implied that there weren't
  really any others that came close.\r\n\r\nI mentioned a couple that I thought were
  contenders, but he contended that these four were THE rock stars, and that any other
  than them were more like 'indie rock.'\r\n\r\nThere are obviously lots of talented
  individuals outside of these, but what about other companies?"

    the designers who in turn own the record label (in most of these cases - Adobe
    notwithstanding). '

  body: "Si is right. Also the Mono-Lino conglomerate has to be there, as well. They
    have a lot of both good and bad in their back list, and their new stuff is also
    uneven. But they have so many classics and enough good recent stuff that I would
    think you have to include them. \r\n\r\nSo from the point of view of 'labels'
    the big 5 (in no particular order) are probably: FontBureau, H&FJ, House Industries,
    Monotype Imaging, and Adobe. \r\n\r\nI don't include Microsoft, as its type is
    normally included with software, rather than sold separately.  Beyond those 5,
    you would probably get more arguments, including about Emigre. \r\n\r\nedit: On
    second thought, if you are thinking 'quality' any list of foundries is probably
    misconceived. The story of type in the past ten years is as much a story of *individuals*
    as foundries, though both are important. For example, Village, with its collection
    of outstanding designers, may be as much of a factor now as House or Emigre. And
    Christian Schwartz, who has published through a number of foundries and collaborations,
    is so productive and his quality so high that he on his own is a virtual foundry.
    Then you have one-man American shops like those of Typophilers Mark Simonson and
    Eric Olsen, who also have a large and high quality body of work.   \r\n\r\nAnd
    among distributors you have Veer and Bitstream (MyFonts), who also have high quality
    work that is exclusive.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think a picture of a big 5 is very representative
    of what is going on in the production of type in the US. "

    even though they also produce their own fonts.
