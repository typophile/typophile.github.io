    encyclopedia articles on the history of maps (also known as cartography).\r\n\r\nYou
    could also use this Wikipedia article as a starting point, although Wikipedia
    articles are NOT authoritative and you should always check more authoritative
    sources such as those found at your library.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cartography"
