  the \"E\" and \"L\" serifs. They have only one direction not two like in Copperplate.\r\n\r\nAny
  idea?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nKurtz\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sull2_4483.jpg]"

    I don't see a match yet. Walter, any idea when and where this was printed?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks for looking Mike,\r\nI doubted this was a digital version or that
    there was a digital version available. I do like it, the Ampersand has more subtle
    character than the Copperplate version."

  body: "There were a number of typefaces shown in Mac McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces
    of the Twentieth Century\", including Pastel, Paragon, Keystone Victoria, Menu
    and McClure that were somewhat similar to this, and all of them were from right
    around the end of the 19th century. this makes me think that maybe this style
    is even older than the things in McGrew's book. Dan Solo has collected many antique
    typefaces, so I searched for his fonts and found two that have somewhat this flavor:
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/berolina/|Berolina]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/arcade/|Arcade]].
    \ (He also has one called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/penny-arcade/|Penny
    Arcade]], which I think is a version of Mural). \r\n\r\nThese three types have
    the flat-topped A and monotone strokes, similar to the ones I saw in McGrew. These
    are the closest I saw, other than Copperplate Gothic, which could possibly be
    modified to be rather like your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, thanks for taking the time to look this.\r\n\r\nThe original file is
    smaller than the sample I inserted here. I enlarged the characters and sharpened
    a bit. Here I attach the original small sample for you to see the characters.
    In the larger version, they can be a little deformed.\r\n\r\nThis is a company
    logo. No idea if this is a new type or an old one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo_5950.jpg]"

  body: "I started searching for \"1890s\" and \"1900s\" fonts and Ray Larabie's update
    of Copperplate Gothic has the wrong ampersand, but the rest of the letters are
    more like your sample. The font is called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/biondi/|Biondi]].
    Perhaps with a bit more tweaking of the serifs you could get pretty close to your
    sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
