  body: Koen, <BR> <BR>Visit Santiago, of course. And when you do, take a bus or two
    out to the suburbs and check out some of the huge murals painted by the people
    who live there. <BR> <BR>Also, Isla Negra, one of the homes of poet Pablo Neruda,
    is a must-see. That&#39;s not too far away from Santiago and if leaving from Santiago
    in the morning you can be back by evening. <BR> <BR>I also understand that Chiloe,
    in the southern region of the country, is a real beauty of a place. <BR> <BR>Enjoy
    plenty of wine, and of course some pisco, too. But drink the pisco in tiny shot
    glasses, it&#39;s strong stuff!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Have a great trip!

    <BR> <BR>And don&#39;t be fooled by Pisco Sours: they are a lot more pisco than
    sour &#40;I think it&#39;s 2-parts pisco to 1 part lemon?&#41; <BR> <BR>I very
    much enjoyed wandering around Santiago w/o a mission or a guide book: I just walked
    where my feet took me, hopped on random buses &amp; subway trains. Delightful
    city, w/ the Cordillera as a constant, beautiful background. Re:typography  --
    lots of latin exuberance, &#39;cept in the big shopping malls, that suffer through
    trying too hard to be Gringo. <BR> <BR>Only warning: stay up-wind of the Mapocho
    River! <BR> <BR>Jay'
