  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Please excuse any ignorance on my part, cause I&rsquo;m fairly new to the study of typography and new to Typophile.</p>
<p>Only a year ago I started purchasing commercial fonts - to augment the usual collection available bundled with programs or shareware/freeware. Now I&rsquo;m hooked&hellip;but I don&rsquo;t have much $$ to invest in fonts and don&rsquo;t have many clients yet, so I have to restrain myself!</p>
<p>I was recently seeking a heavy, clean-looking, modern italic sans, and found Leitura Sans [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/leitura-sans/italic-4/]] on MyFonts - that worked well for my purpose. All the DS fonts were half-price that month, so I helped myself to some of the Leitura Roman text fonts too.</p>
<p>Now I don&rsquo;t like Leitura Roman text font at all, and asked myself why I bought it![[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/leitura/]] The PDF advert was so beautifully designed it deceived me&hellip;</p>
<p>Mostly, I detest the lower case &ldquo;g&rdquo; - it has little flag sticking up on the upper right like a cowlick. Rather than gracefully leading the eye to the next letter, it sticks out most unpleasantly. I can&rsquo;t seem to get past that. Did you ever decide not to use a font because of a single letter?</p>
<p>Last week a page on this site pointed me to a modern text font bundled with Powerpoint that I like better - Cambria.</p>
<p>I know that someone is likely to tell me that Cambria sucks or is already becoming overused, but my question is this:
Have you ever made a misjudgement choosing type? and why?</p>

<p>I will say DSType definitely has strong personalities, so you either get along with them or you don&rsquo;t. That said, if it&rsquo;s just the g that&rsquo;s not doing it for you, modify it (provided the EULA allows it, of course).</p>

<p>The strongest tools foundries have to sell their typefaces are the specimens. If they are well designed I will raise my hand with guilt that I find myself wanting to license the fonts.</p>
<p>Dino&rsquo;s specimen demonstrates clearly how the g from the Leitura News was changed or designed to contrast with Leitura. Did you like you not notice it in the specimen? (Maybe I&rsquo;m looking at a different specimen.) I actually think it is quite cute, but can imagine that once you&rsquo;ve locked onto something you don&rsquo;t like it won&rsquo;t disappear. I have a few typefaces that I won&rsquo;t license because of quirks I&rsquo;ve noticed.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re right, the weird &ldquo;g&rdquo; clearly shows in the diagram.</p>
<p>At the time, I admired the chiseled, angular outline of the Leitura letterforms and preferred them over the rounded edges and curved brackets of the Leitura News.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;g&rdquo; flag bothered me only when I saw how it annoying looked with the other letters in a line of text&hellip;after I had bought it and started experimenting with it, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve bought a number of fonts on impulse, but believed I had made a studied decision with Leitura, damn it.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>
Speaking of impulse, I have a weakness for juicy, beautiful retro designs like Nick's Fonts. I have all of his older free ones and bought 5 or 6 of his commercial fonts. Not once have I used one for a job - it just gives me pleasure to play with them like a pair of frivolous shoes. Every time I tell myself: Okay, no more Nick's Fonts, Dina, until you get a paying job using one of these...

At least with Nick's I've never stop liking any, though I knew each was an unecessary purchase. </code></pre></div>

<p>Just the other day I was able to use Ecliptica italic in a poster headline. I&rsquo;ve got loads of other fonts which I&rsquo;ve yet to use, just waiting for the right project. Priori Sans is a good example, I almost used that recently but changed my mind at the last minute. And I bought Amplitude three and a half years ago, when it was really fashionable, and couldn&rsquo;t find the right project for it! I&rsquo;ve used it a couple of times, but not enough to do it justice. And now it isn&rsquo;t so trendy anymore so I&rsquo;ve effectively shelved it.</p>
<p>One of the funny things about big font collections, like the Bitstream Type Odyssey, is that you don&rsquo;t really know what you&rsquo;ve got for the first few years. Even now, I&rsquo;m still feeling my way around. But I still want to buy more type!</p>

<p>I would never have guessed that Amplitude is no longer trendy. It looks trendy to me, but of course a working design professional in the industry is much more conscious of trends. My customers would never know the difference. Frutinger and Amplitude would look the same to them. They would even be surprised that &ldquo;trends&rdquo; aand &ldquo;fashions&rdquo; in type exist.</p>
<p>You might guess they are not magazine publishers and high-end boutiques.</p>
