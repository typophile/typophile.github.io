  Archer and other such fonts? Im looking for something with character, but equally
  it shouldn't be too fun. Im after 'Restrained character' - you heard it here first.\r\nPlease
  pass on any links to fonts you like in a similar vein to those listed above.\r\n\r\nThanks

    for a while, I haven't used it, but its antique forms are reminiscent of a less
    quirky American Typewriter.

    \r\nthe font I'm working on. I'd be curious if you think it fits the description.
    \r\nIt's still gonna be a little while until this truly sees the light of day
    though.\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/53395?page=2#comment-350349"

  body: For a more contemporary (or is it already old hat?) face, try Lineto's Courier
    Sans, Superstudio, Excellent, Lettera, Regular or Valentine. The site does not
    work in Safari 4.0 by the way.

  body: "Thanks for evreryone's responses... all good fonts. \r\nUpon further reflection,
    Lineto's Lettera is certainly something id consider as its 'Restrained character'
    is coupled with a strong contemporary feel... certainly something im after. I
    do also like Everson Mono (freeware: http://www.evertype.com/emono/ ) and maybe
    i can use this as a starting point to create something similar. Hm.\r\n\r\nAltaira,
    i like you're font, i think it fits the restrained character description for sure...
    certainly something id consider if/when it becomes available. \r\n \r\nThanks
    everyone, anymore then keep them coming...\r\n\r\n"
