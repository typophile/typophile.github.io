  body: "Hi Yogendra,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m afraid that one letter is a little too little
    to identify a typeface. Maybe the cracks can prove me wrong \u2013 then again,
    a \u2018v\u2019 isn\u2019t very characteristic, and what\u2019s more, the sample
    is quite small.\r\nAll I can tell you that it is an italic \u2018v\u2019 from
    a \u2018Modern\u2019 serif face, i.e. a classicist design that follows the form
    principles of the pointed pen. An example would be this <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/itc_bodoni_seventy_two_book_italic/?sample_text=v&sample_size=388
    \">(ITC) Bodoni</a> \u2013 you see, it is somewhat similar, but no cigar.\r\n\r\nF"
