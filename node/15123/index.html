  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Greetings, everyone.</p>
<p>I have been lurking around Typophile for quite some time.</p>
<p>A number of you seem enlightened when it comes to typography, not just font design. I&rsquo;ve read some interesting (often quite heated) discussions.</p>
<p>My question has to do with paragraphs that occur in essays and reports on an 8.5x11 page. My right and left margins are 1.55 inches, top and bottom are an inch. Font is 11 pt. Palatino (Adobe&rsquo;s Palatino LTstd.) Leading is fixed at 16 points. Indent is 18 points (should be 16, but I prefer a little more emphasis.) Line length is 12-13 words (less than 6 inches.) Text is ranged left, ragged right (I find justified text abhorrent.) Gentle hyphenation where necessary. There&rsquo;s nothing like a soft, soothing rag!</p>
<p>So, would it be better to indent paragraphs, or simply leave a white space between paragraphs, calculated at half the leading (8 points or so)? I&rsquo;ve always gone for the &ldquo;block paragraph&rdquo; look, but recently I&rsquo;ve gotten the impression that it is poor form. I&rsquo;m willing to change in the name of correct typography.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d appreciate any advice.</p>

The big problem with letter sized paper is that usually the measure is too long, as it sounds like it is in your case. A line over 75 or 80 characters is not good for continuous reading, even with additional leading, as you have done.</p>
<p>I think this is an extremely important feature of readable typography. Check on this and fix it if need be.</p>

<p>Margins, left and right, are now 1.75 inches, so lines are now 5 inches wide or so. There is an improvement in readability, certainly, but the way the text sits looks a bit odd with those generous margins.

<p>Still, it reads faster. The rag makes it warmer and more inviting, too.</p>

<p>No. Indented paragraphs are very old, long before the typewriter. They are an excellent way to mark paragraphs, and in my opinion you should only depart from this standard when you have a good reason to. The standard indents are, according to Bringhurst, one en, one em and one &lsquo;lead&rsquo; meaning that if the text is 10/12 the indent is 12 points.</p>
<p>Bringhurst notes that spaces between paragraphs are standard in business letters, and can be OK in short business materials because they suggest &ldquo;precision crispness and speed. &hellip;In longer sequences, they may seem soulless and uninviting.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen that indent rule: indent matches the leading.</p>
<p>Jan Tschichold, Bringhurst, and I think even Eric Gill are all in favour of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s intersting that an indent of that length doesn&rsquo;t really stand out on the page. Sure, you know it&rsquo;s there, but it doesn&rsquo;t draw the eye to it. In fact, if the last line of the paragraph runs to nearly the full measure, you might miss the indent at first glance, until of course your eyes get there during the course of reading. It&rsquo;s a very unobtrusive way to signal a new paragraph.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people simply prefer the clarity and crispness of block paragraphs. Eah paragraph is a separate, logical unit. I find that block paragraphs that are separated by half the leading and no more are more pleasing.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;m beginning to feel that indenting is a warmer and more inviting method. This time, the margins and comfortable leading provide the breathing room, and not the white space between paragraphs. Although one usually ends up with some white space anyway,  since the last line of a paragraph doesn&rsquo;t usually run the full measure.</p>

<p>But you&rsquo;re glossing over the fact their genesis was in fact a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo;! They were empty spaces reserved for rubrication/illuimination, but often left unused (sometimes because of deadlines, sometimes because of different[ly priced] editions). That said, I do agree they&rsquo;re less bad than flush paragraphs; you&rsquo;d have to have a particularly nasty strain of the Modernism virus to prefer <cite>that</cite>.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More beautiful option&rdquo;? Well, yes, although nothing to do with digital: the portly but practical Pilcrow! And what&rsquo;s really nice about it is that you can use it right in the middle of a &ldquo;physical&rdquo; paragraph block to mark a separate &ldquo;conceptual&rdquo; paragraph (like on my site), often saving space and gaining elegance.</p>
