  body: "I like the overall feel of this, but it seems very scattered.  It needs more
    consistency, in stroke weight and pattern. \r\n\r\nLowercase c, x and y look more
    uppercase than uppercase C, X and Y.  Lowercase r looks like uppercase Gamma.
    I think the descenders g, p, q, j and y, should actually descend.  Uppercase O
    is boring; lowercase o is too stylized compared to the other letters. Lowercase
    t looks more like it's an uppercase T, and more like 7 than the actual 7 does.
    I think 0 (zero) should use the O shape, with the same center ring and dot as
    the zero.  I like the numbers, except 7 and 0. Uppercase N looks too plain. \r\n\r\nI
    like the f, q, P, R. \r\n\r\nTry writing natural, mixed-case text with this and
    see how it looks. That should lead you to fix the consistency.\r\n\r\n-matt"

  body: "Thanks so much for your detailed critique; I really appreciate the time you
    spent to construct such a detailed, insightful comment. I'll keep working!\r\nI'm
    trying to follow a system, maybe too rigidly, whereby all the letters are the
    same height and width\u2013with a couple of exceptions, namely W, M, and X. It
    makes it tough to build some of the lowercase letters, especially v (I hate V).
    O's and 0 are tough too.\r\n\r\n"
