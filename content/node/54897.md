  border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>\r\n\r\nWord mark, I am designing to reflect
  my own identity. \r\n\r\nWord ABgD (pronounced Abjad) literally means letters A
  B G and D representing the original order of Phoenician alphabets. The closest example
  today can be seen in Greek (Alpha, Beta, Gama, Delta). Abjad is a type of writing
  system in which each symbol stands for a consonant; the reader must supply the appropriate
  vowel. This is the very philosophy that I practice under brand name ABgD - I provide
  consonants and the client provides the vowel. The contribution of client is important
  as it gives meaning to my work. \r\n\r\nAll known abjads belong to the Semitic family
  of scripts. These scripts are thought to derive from the Proto-Sinaitic alphabet
  (dated to about 1500 BC) which is thought to derive from Egyptian hieroglyphs. The
  abjad was significantly simpler than the earlier hieroglyphs. The number of distinct
  glyphs was reduced tremendously, at the cost of increased ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThe
  first abjad to gain widespread usage was the Phoenician abjad. Unlike other contemporary
  scripts, such as Cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs, the Phoenician script consisted
  of only about two dozen symbols. This made the script easy to learn, and Phoenician
  seafaring merchants took the script wherever they went. Phoenician gave way to a
  number of new writing systems, including the Greek alphabet, the first \"true\"
  alphabet, and Aramaic, a widely used abjad. Greek evolved into the modern western
  alphabets, such as Latin and Cyrillic, while Aramaic became the ancestor of many
  modern abjads and abugidas of Asia.\r\n\r\nAramaic spread across Asia, reaching
  as far as India and becoming Brahmi, the ancestral abugida to most modern Indian
  and Southeast Asian scripts. In the Middle East, Aramaic gave rise to the Hebrew
  and Nabataean abjads, which retained many of the Aramaic letter forms. The Syriac
  script was a cursive variation of Aramaic. It is unclear whether the Arabic abjad
  was derived from Nabatean or Syriac.\r\n\r\nI hope you like the concept and design.
  I am open to ctritique - to learn and to proceed. \r\n \r\n"

    Thanks for liking the mark :) The first wordmark I designed was itslft very esoteric
    (the mark itself) but i redisigned it to this after critiques i got, as it was
    too much esotericism. \r\n\r\nFeel free to suggest anything u like, I am open
    to learning:)\r\n\r\nABgD"
