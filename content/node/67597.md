  please end this madness and identify the font used in the words Brazil and Ireland?\r\n\r\nIt
  looks so simple , and I should know this already , but I'm literally drawing a blank
  over here. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance. "

  body: "Thanks Mike.\r\n\r\nWe have an older Font Folio disc here at the shop and
    I even thought that might have been the right font at one point. What kept throwing
    me off though was the letter 'E' and the center bar. \r\n\r\nDo you think someone
    probably tweaked the letter a bit?  "

  body: "That's possible. It's also possible that it isn't Frutiger, because the truth
    is that these letters aren't the best for ID purposes. I based my guess mostly
    on the R shape. In fact, if the \"Tuesday 2nd March 2010\" is the same family,
    then it sure isn't Frutiger. The M and 1 are wrong for starters.\r\n\r\nOne question
    is how close does it have to be? Few people would notice the shorter middle arm
    of the E if everything else was pretty close. I try to be pragmatic about these
    things.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega "

    only one I found with the R, 1 and M was Linotype's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/agilita/|Agilita]],
    but in spite of those features being close, the overall letterforms (D, for example)
    are not quite right.\r\n\r\nIf you have Frutiger, I'd sure think you could go
    with that, if letter perfect isn't needed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
