  body: "I would move \"in memoriam\" and the cross to the top. Enlarge the cross
    and maybe outline it so the black of the letter is not so prominent.\r\n\r\nStarting
    with \"SNCO\" and ending is \"sar\xE0\" : Make the text for geometries that suggest
    triangular shapes. Two triangles on top of each other kind of thing.\r\n\r\nMMVII
    smaller and spaced with blanks\r\n\r\nAll'insegna di\" = italic\r\n\r\nThe line
    is too dark, Maybe cut one third of it off.\r\n\r\nTry this up, if you like to.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n\r\nps:
    SNCO maybe better in a smaller size"

  body: "IMHO, I would replace the lower bar, you could use some ornaments, or maybe
    just making it lighter will work out. The thing is that in its current size, it's
    a bit undecided, like, she doesn't know if she has to be there or not.\r\nYou
    could add a bit of spacing between S and N and between C and O."

  body: It would be nice to see the edges of the page... To see the margins. It's
    just text floating in space right now.  :-)

  body: "The C needs to be kerned to the left slightly, the spacing is visually uneven.\r\nAt
    the bottom, the blackletter type comes out of nowhere...maybe if its on a line
    of its own. Closing up the space between \"in Memoriam\" is a thought, and maybe
    letterspacing the Memoriam and making it slightly larger...\r\n"
