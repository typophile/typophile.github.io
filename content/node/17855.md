body: I'm building a font using fontographer 4.15 on a mac and could use some advice.
  In my font the lowercase characters are exactly the same sizes but with some minor
  tweaks as the uppercase ones. I have kerned the uppercase charcters and want to
  apply the same kernning values to the lowercase characters without having to go
  through them all manually again. Is there a function to apply the values from the
  uppercase to the lowercase? Maybe using kerninng assistance can do it but I don't
  know how to use it. Thanks for your time.

  body: "I could be mistaken, but it sounds like you want to adjust sidebearings--not
    kerning. (Kerning overrides the sidebearing values for specific character pairs.)\r\n\r\nYou
    can copy left or right sidebearing values from one character to any number of
    other characters using the \"Set Metrics...\" command. The options should be pretty
    easy to figure out."

    body: Thanks for this but what I want to do is to have all the kerning pairs that
      exist in the uppercase characters to also exist in the lowercase characters
      with the same values. I have already made the metrics the same values using
      the metrics assistance function, what I need is to do the same with kerning
      pairs.

    I would have to go through the tutorial myself to refresh my memory. I do remember
    enough to say it will let you do what you are trying to do. Maybe someone else
    who is more actively using FOG will rise to the occasion.)

    me get back to you on this."

  body: "Okay. It's coming back to me.\r\n\r\nHere is the KA dialog box for an all
    caps font which has duplicate caps in the lowercase positions:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/
    FontographerScreenSnapz001.png]\r\n\r\n(This is in FOG 4.7 (demo), but it works
    the same in any FOG 4.0 or later. I don't know why there are some strange characters
    in some of the rows. Just ignore them.)\r\n\r\nNote that in the first field are
    a bunch of A's, both upper and lowercase. The design of these characters is identical
    for kerning purposes, so they are \"equivalent first letters\", the left-hand
    letter in a kerning pair. The field the two T's is another set of equivalent characters
    for the right-hand position. Don't worry about the \"link all\" check boxes for
    now.\r\n\r\nWhat this first row says is that every pair composed of a character
    from the left and one from the right will have the same kerning value. If you
    change the kerning value of any of these pairs (using the Metrics window), the
    others will change automatically, as if they are all marching in lock step. So,
    if you change AT, you are also changing At, aT, at, \xE1T, \xC5t, etc. The reverse
    is also true.\r\n\r\nThe \"link all\" check boxes let you take a shortcut in certain
    situations. Let's say you have the following pair equivalents set up:\r\n\r\nF\_\_\_\_[x]\_\_\_\_A\xC5\xC1\xC0\xC3\_\_\_[x]\r\nP\_\_\_\_[x]\_\_\_\_A\xC5\xC1\xC0\xC3\_\_\_[x]\r\nT\_\_\_\_[x]\_\_\_\_A\xC5\xC1\xC0\xC3\_\_\_[x]\r\n\r\n(Pretend
    the x's are the check boxes.) F followed by any of those As will have the same
    kerning value. Same with the P and T. This is a bit redundant, and it would seem
    that you need to do it this way unless you want FA, PA, and TA to have the same
    kerning value. BUT, by unchecking one of the \"link all\" boxes you can combine
    these into one row:\r\n\r\nFPT\_\_\_\_[\_\_]\_\_\_\_A\xC5\xC1\xC0\xC3\_\_\_[x]\r\n\r\nThe
    F, P, and T are not linked to each other and will have independent kerning values
    with regard to the As. So, if you change the FA kerning pair, the F\xC5 pair will
    also change, but not PA, P\xC5, TA, T\xC5, etc. The limitation is that it's an
    all or nothing proposition. If you want the F and T to be linked, but not the
    P, then you can't put them in the same row. You would need one row with the F
    and T, and another row for the P.\r\n\r\nNote: At least one of the two check boxes
    should always be checked. If both boxes are unchecked, then nothing in that row
    will be linked, and whatever you put in that row will have no effect on the kerning,
    as if the row did not exist.\r\n\r\nNormally, you will want both boxes checked
    and not bother with this unlinking option. It just makes things more complicated
    and less flexible for very little gain.\r\n\r\nAlso, normally you will leave the
    \"make new pairs\" option checked. If it is off, KA will only affect existing
    kerning pairs and not generate new pairs, which is usually why you use KA in the
    first place. There are, however, situations in which you want to, say, clean up
    inconsistent kerning pairs without generating new ones. Also, using KA with \"make
    new pairs\" on can potentially generate a lot of pairs which will never be used
    in the real world. After you've used KA to generate all the pairs you need, you
    can turn this option off and delete the extraneous pairs. The pairs that are left
    will still be linked.\r\n\r\nOne other thing: Certain characters (single-straight-quote,
    exclamation, comma and hyphen) have special meanings in the KA window. As a result,
    you can't include them in character lists just by typing them. There is a simple
    way around it: Just use a single quote before the character ('' or '- or ', or
    '!). You can see an example of this in the third row, second field (',). [edit:
    Typophile's formatting genie is messing with my straight quotes.]"

    you click \"OK\", FOG rearranges the characters in ASCII order and compresses
    the list (if possible) using the special hyphen character. The hyphen means \"through\".
    The run of a's with accents I typed happen to be consecutive characters in the
    Mac Roman encoding when listed in ASCII order. The spaces separate the shorthand
    notation from the rest of the list.\r\n\r\nThe straight quote is the escape character.
    I'm not sure what the comma or exclamation point are used for."

      on mac. In this the images are very poor quality and you cant see things if
      they are small. I had a look at the pdf you have online which is much better
      but refers to the new version of fontographer although the information seems
      similar if not the same. I must say that the section on kerning assistance is
      fairly difficult to understand.
