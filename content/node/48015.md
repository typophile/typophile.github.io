  body: Empty trash doesn't completely delete the files; it just saves the space occupied
    by them to be overwritten the next time you add data to your computer. Secure
    empty trash writes over the part of the hard drive occupied by those files.

    fairly easily. There are utilities out there for making a bit more sure your data
    is gone when you delete it (mainly by overwriting the file a good couple of times
    - which helps, though the data may still be recoverable, unless you do something
    to the hardware itself)...\r\n\r\nFor the normal day-to-day, though, a secure
    empty trash should suffice..  ;)\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.5/en/8279.html"

  body: but doing the "secure" empty trash after a number of normal empties removes
    all the extra space?

    <cite>Any</cite> overwritten data is both difficult and expensive to recover,
    even when using the special equipment necessary to do so.\r\n\r\nA single pass
    of zeroes is more than sufficient for over 99% of users in the world. Anything
    else is more placebo than anything else."

  body: "Well, it's like shredding paper. Run it through a regular shredder once,
    and it'll be safe for most prying eyes - and for 99% of users, that'll be enough.
    But if you're planning to take over the world Pinky & the Brain-style, you'll
    still want that paper turned into pulp and burned, then scotch-taped to an atom
    bomb and sent into outer space, where it'll be blown to smithereens...\r\n\r\nSure,
    it's overkill for most users - but bombs in space are still more fun. ^.^ Just
    the same way <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/business/shredder.html\">the
    shredder widget for mac</a> is more fun than secure empty trash.\r\n\r\n(Oh, and
    by \"fun\", I of course mean \"secure\".)"
