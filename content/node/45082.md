body: I am working on a project about Shaker furniture and am trying to figure out
  what Shaker type looks like. Does anyone know where I could find/see any examples
  of how the Shakers used to do type? I have been trying to find maps or bibles made
  by the Shakers but am having no luck.

    You might try a font like DeVinne that looks like an old map font.\r\n\r\nOr you
    could not worry about trying to imitate their graphic/type style and just use
    an elegant, economical, unadorned font that complements their style."

  body: I agree with Patty. Shaker furniture to me is about the absolute minimum of
    adornment with the maximum of quality. The idea of creating exactly what you need
    to fulfill your requirements and nothing more. This doesn't mean a sans, it just
    means something that lets the imagery do the talking first and foremost.

    the taste of their own homes, but it is authentic. I am finding some charming

  body: "I live just down the road from the Hancock Shaker village in the Berkshires
    of western Massachusetts. So I have some familiarity with the Shakers' aesthetic.\r\n\r\nYou'll
    have to decide whether you want to use type that evokes the qualities that we
    ascribe to Shaker furniture or whether you want type that is authentic to the
    Shaker community itself and the period in which original Shaker furniture was
    made. These are two *very* different things.\r\n\r\nThe qualities that most people
    associate with the Shakers -- simplicity, spare elegance, functionalism, etc.
    -- have been mentioned and there are a lot of contemporary typefaces that evoke
    those same qualities. I'm sure you'll get plenty of suggestions for these.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the Shakers themselves were products of their Victorian environment when it came
    to their own printing and advertising. You can see this most readily in the seed
    boxes, seed labels, and herb labels, such as shown in William's link above. Lots
    of different faces in quite a cacophony of styles, ironically. \r\n\r\nAs far
    as their bibles and such, these were printed with the text types that were current
    in the day -- the DeVinne that Patty suggests is an excellent example. (This one:
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/, not some of the others that
    come up in a search.) Nick Shinn's Scotch Modern (serif) and Figgins grotesque
    (sans serif) are good contemporary versions of designs from this same period.\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\n--
    Kent.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I find both Areplos and Matrix look far too contemporary and \"digital age\"
    to really capture the spirit of Shaker design. You need something with a more
    timeless quality. The book I have uses Bauer Text initials as the display font
    which works beautifully.\r\n\r\nIt's a trick to marry the concepts of simplicity,
    elegance, and craft. If you choose something too simple you run the risk of it
    looking dull (IMO Tankard's Shaker falls into this category). Too \"crafty\" and
    it starts to edge towards kitsch. Personally, I'd use a serif and make sure it's
    very carefully kerned."

  body: "Mark H., the real Shaker furniture is not heavy, but light. [[http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request|Here
    you can see some good pictures of the real stuff.]]\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it
    is light where the latter \"mission\" and arts and crafts stuff is relatively
    heavy. In fact it generally looks fragile, but in fact is quite strong, as it
    was so well made. One of the things they consistently did to change existing designs
    was not only to remove ornament, but to make everything lighter and finer, and
    have elegant proportions.  \r\n\r\nIt is really a unique aesthetic, and one that
    I don't think has really been created in type. So probably Patty's ideas here
    are the best. \r\n\r\nThe closest anything comes is the early Danish modern furniture
    in the late forties and early fifties, which was influenced by the Shakers' work.
    The Danish stuff is more slick and posh--though also very nice.   "

    the corrected link]].\r\n\r\nThose slats don't look heavy in three dimensions.
    They are only a quarter inch thick. Also the arch is because the sides have been
    cut down. In a usual chair they would be straight across and as thick at the sides
    as the middle. The middle being wider is probably for comfort. These chairs are
    incredibly comfortable to sit in, though they don't look it. For a start they
    slant back and are relatively low to the ground. \r\n\r\nThe straight-on look
    here also looks heavier because of the shrunken scale of the picture.\r\n\r\nAlso
    those legs and rails are maybe half the diameter of usual ones.\r\n\r\nThe 'mission'
    stuff, by contrast is often built of square, heavy oak planks. \r\n\r\nI have
    a reproduction Shaker 'taped' rocker I always read my morning paper in, and love
    it. Our dining table is a reproduction of a Shaker trestle table, now in the Fruitlands
    Museum. The top is only 3/4 inch thick and the legs 1 1/8 inch thick. And the
    usual heavy cross bar between the two legs is removed, and replaced with two light
    angle pieces. And the usual heavy bar foot is replaced by a light arch. It is
    the lightest dining table I have ever seen. The rocker is also much lighter than
    normal rockers.  \r\n\r\nI just checked on line, but all the reproductions they
    show of the trestle table are heavier, and often totally wrong. Many furniture
    makers call anything un-oramented \"Shaker\", but there is a lot more to it. The
    authentic light dimensions are harder to make, and still be strong.\r\n\r\nAs
    Chris quoted above from the famous Shaker hymn, their belief was \"tis a gift
    to be simple\". For them simplicity was a kind of sacred ideal, and the best of
    the real stuff just radiates that aura.  "

  body: "'tis a gift to be free...\r\n\r\nLooks like a typical Shaker chair to me
    William, well except the cane seat and the caps on the feet of the back leg's
    ;) Those slats look right to me.\r\n\r\nShakers mastered the stylish slim tappered
    vertical while keeping horizontals under check (accent on upward movement of line),
    and adornments like pommel finials, and my favorite mushroom caps, (etc.) are
    neat touches to those lines. So I think Patty suggestion of De Vinne is just about
    right, the caps though seem a little bit too wide(?).\r\n\r\nAs fate would have
    it, I just ordered a copy of 'Seen and Received: The Shakers' Private Art', which
    is a book about the groovy graphic designs produced by the Shaker's spirit Interpreters
    as they were known as (a.k.a. graphic designers). Hannah Cohoons kick @ss designs
    (tree of life, tree of spirit, etc.), would make an interesting theme for a Shaker
    font. So too would Semantha Fairbanks flouishes, almost blackletterish to me.
    \r\n\r\n\r\n'Tis the gift to be simple,\r\n'tis the gift to be free,\r\n'tis the
    gift to come down\r\nwhere we ought to be,\r\nand when we find ourselves in the
    place just right,\r\n'twill be in the valley of love and delight.\r\nWhen true
    simplicity is gained\r\nto bow and to bend we shan't be ashamed,\r\nto turn, turn,
    will be our delight\r\ntill by turning, turning we come round right. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would suggest that the best typeface to talk about Shaker arts would do
    so obliquely, with a very very spare but delicate nineteenth-century look...like
    Emigre's Filosofia or ITC Bodoni Twelve...rather than a sans, which goes in the
    wrong direction, or any fonts they used to promo their products at the time...they
    used what was available and customary, and a very motley mix it was too!
