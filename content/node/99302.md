body: "Hello! \r\n\r\nA newbie question: How do I make guidelines appear in all glyph
  windows at the same time? Currently, when I add a guideline, that guideline is only
  visible to the current glyph I'm working on. I need to add certain guidelines to
  mark certain common points across all my glyphs, let's say the height of stress
  marks/accents and so on... I haven't figured yet how to do this )\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!"

  body: You can right-click on any guideline and click on "convert to global" in the
    context menu to turn it into a global guideline.
