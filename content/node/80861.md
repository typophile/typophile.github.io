  anyone know where we can find the Noteworthy font presently in the iOS operating
  system? We have a number of apps that could be designed much better utilizing this
  higher-quality font rather than Marker Felt or Chalkboard, but, obviously, to get
  client sign-off, w need to show them what it looks like.\r\n\r\nAny help would be
  appreciated!"
