body: I need to track down this font which has been scanned off a T-shirt design from
  the 70s. I have found it in a Typefinder book and they have named it Blanchard but
  I can't seem to find it! Can anyone help?

    it didn\u2019t make it to digital."

    that if you click on the image at the URL above, you'll get a larger image and
    a few letters from Zorba can be seen on the cover of the book."
