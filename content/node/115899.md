  used of\r\nthe VHS version of Disney's Sleeping Beauty.  As far as I know is this
  the only version where  a more distinct Gothic typeface is used.\r\n\r\nIn the url
  \ a sample:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.catawiki.com/catalog/dvd-video-blu-ray/carriers/vhs-video-tape/974049-sleeping-beauty\r\n\r\nBefore
  I contact the Disney Studio's themselves or Buena Vista Home Entertainment (if they
  still exist), I want to ask you guys.\r\n\r\nThanx in advance!\r\n"

    body: "Thanx for the quick reply.\r\n\r\nOld English typeface makes sense, sinds
      its about legend of Arthur.\r\nGood to know that Disney Artists in general make
      deviations from\r\nexisting fonts. \r\n\r\nThe title from Hunchback of Notre
      Dame i did find at What the Font\r\nbut the one from Sleeping Beauty i didnt.\r\n\r\nMaybe
      more spacing between characters in my image? \r\nHe didnt recognised it, and
      the Old English type is to be found on My Fonts, so...\r\n\r\n\r\n"
