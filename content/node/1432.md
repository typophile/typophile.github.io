body: This logo is for my freelance design work. I will do a stationary after I complete
  my logo. I have had the TC icon for awhile but I haven&#39;t found type that worked.
  I want to keep the icon the way it is and work around it. <BR> <BR>On suggestions
  from before when I posted on here I have made the typeface more mechanical. I used
  Industria in all caps. I never thought I would use this typeface, but I believe
  it works with the icon. I would love suggestions! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/17099.gif"

  body: 'Tom: <BR> <BR>I like the &#34;CT&#34; mark. Your insistance to accompany
    the mark with the Tom Cannon Design name is wise, as the &#34;C&#34; is difficult
    to discover on its own. The black framed &#34;design&#34;, however is not doing
    it for me. I think this approach is generating competition between the &#34;CT&#34;
    mark and the name. <BR> <BR>Attached are a couple of alternative suggestions using
    Armada &#40;name font&#41;. There aren&#39;t any additional design elements to

  body: Hi Tom, <BR> <BR>very nice icon. I see the &#39;C&#39;, but does everyone
    see it? You could always rotate it ccw so that the T is horizontal.  <BR> <BR>I
    would cancel the type with the frames. The icon is already strong, don&#39;t mess
    it up with other shapes and blockforms. I would go for clean type that has character.
    Therefor I agree with Scott. <BR>Personally I would not put the text centered
    under the icon. Perhaps smaller beside the logo. Choose your type carefully but
    don&#39;t let it overshadow the icon. <BR>I will look around for a type that I
    think could fit. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren

    suggest loosing the rule around the mark. It doesn&#39;t really add anything and
    just further polarizes the style differences between the mark and type. Can you
    use the &#39;T&#39; from the typeface in the mark? I can&#39;t tell if the T has
    any small unique identifiers to it, but it might help tie them together. I&#39;d
    also drop the two-tone grey. It&#39;s just too much IMHO. <BR> <BR>

    and the existing &#34;T&#34; other than the Armada arms seem to be slightly shorter

    I have to disagree with the stroke around the circle. I think the stroke subtracts
    from the simplicity or rather complicates the design. I also wonder if the T could
    &#34;break out of the box&#34;, so to speak?

    didn&#39;t fit armada, but I didn&#39;t want to change the font. <BR> <BR>I think
    the icon can work with the text if the text is spread out 125%. I still like the

    a cool effect to have only color on top and not on the sides.  <BR> <BR>Below
    I darkened all the text to the same blue-grey color. The 2 toned text didn&#39;t
    bother me, but I can see your point. With the sides grey &#40;if I keep them grey&#41;
    it seemed to go with it. Then again, I have looked at it too long! Thanks for

    <BR> <BR>Consider each grey a color...meaning you have too many colors. Adding
    grey to the logo is just adding another color--it&#39;s not doing a whole lot
    to tie it in to the two-tone type. <BR> <BR>The monotone type is better. I&#39;d
    maybe try setting the type in black as well. For the record, the second logo is
