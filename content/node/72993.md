  to range from dubstep to up-beat pop... that ilk) asked me to have a go at a logo.\r\n\r\nHe
  specified letterforms that were of a simpler geometry and added that he wanted it
  to appeal to male listeners from 16 years old to possibly early 30s.\r\n\r\nI wanted
  to create something reasonably dynamic, given the nature of the music, and try to
  evoke a sense of movement, which lead me to this current design. It contains a very
  subtle nod back to the once-emerging dance scene, here in Manchester (maybe not
  even just this city), but without overtly clinging on to the sentiment.\r\n\r\nI'm
  reasonably pleased with it so far - a rarity for me - but no doubt there are elements
  I've overlooked and not considered.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts are gratefully received."

  body: I don't know if I see "movement," though I do see energy and I think the slashes
    play off the diagonals of the letters in an appealing way. At what sizes will
    it appear? At small sizes those fine lines may get lost.

    point - I wrote that in haste - it's certainly more an attempt at dynamism than
    movement.\r\n\r\nAs for its intended use, I think initially it'll be for digital
    promotion. Then, as soon as they begin to tour (they've recently been booked to
    support a major artist for his UK dates) it will move to print.\r\n\r\nIt did
    cross my mind that the diagonals may not suit smaller sizes, but probably not
    significantly enough until you pointed it out. I'm not averse to thickening them
    a touch to suit, or entrusting them with two (or more) versions."

    IMO, and the N diagonal might benefit from a 90 degree angle between it and the
    other diagonals. Pay attention to spacing!"

  body: "Thanks for the input frode frank.\r\n\r\nI think I know what you're saying
    about those particular sets of 'cuts' - they're not ideal - I just wanted to get
    a sense of whether you guys felt it worked as an idea. There will certainly be
    composition revisions.\r\n\r\nBut about the spacing; I wasn't completely sure
    how to approach this.\r\nThe design was built on a grid, with the strokes being
    1 unit wide and, when unaltered, each glyph is roughly 1 unit apart, as below:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/citizen_spacing_5526.gif]\r\n\r\nAlthough
    it's not perfect I think it's reasonably close in this way. But obviously as cuts
    are made the spacing increases in areas - most notably between the Z and E. I
    wasn't sure whether people's eyes would automatically fill-in the missing areas
    and mentally construct an image roughly as shown, or whether I should treat each
    shape as new and then space it accordingly - possibly risking letters virtually
    'bumping' into one another. I do trust your opinion on this, but I'd like to know
    if others felt the same way, as though there were too much space in areas, rather
    than imagining extended letters, spaced as illustrated.\r\n\r\nI tried a 45\xB0
    diagonal on the N, but wasn't sure if it would make that letter too wide, I may
    well retry it."

    the spacing issue is on the way to being rectified, although if anyone has any
    further input regarding this, I'd be happy to hear.\r\n\r\nHowever, a 45\xB0 diagonal
    within the N just doesn't seem to sit well.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/citizen_02_6333.gif]"
