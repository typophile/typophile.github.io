    body: "Yes, I was going to say that a) it's an unknown font b) the graphic designer
      made it himself \u2014 but I just get an e-mail from Stefan Thorsteinsson and
      indeed, it is his own typeface called \xAB Hewitt \xBB. Anyway, thank you so
      much for the similar typefaces, it could be useful now."
