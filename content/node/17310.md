  the magenta helped to give it a \"classic but modern\" feel. Is the logotype readable
  enough? What do you interpret it as?\r\n\r\nI'm planning on using Neenah's Environment

  body: "The magenta works fine. It's also appropriate because it's a \"process\"
    color. I read the identity as \"design process\"; if, as I suspect from the url,
    you want people to see \"is a,\" maybe you should make the \"1s\" black also.
    Or maybe that's complicating things too much.\r\n\r\nThe post office won't be
    happy with that envelope. The return address should never be below the recipient
    address. It screws with their automatic readers.\r\n\r\nThe word is spelled \"facsimile.\""

  body: "hi travis,\r\n\r\njust came across your designs: very classic indeed, but
    i quite like it. yes, to me it's perfectly readable. the notion of design as being
    something of a process comes to your mind first thing. and the overall impression
    is very professional.\r\n\r\ni'm wondering about a couple of minor things: don't
    know about the periods between \"telephone\" and the actual number etc. - they're
    not really needed since there's a colour change. so they add some unnecessary
    disturbance. \r\n\r\nalso the black seems a bit harsh: have you tried other colours
    like very dark greyish blues and so on, that just might make it a little more
    modern. and then there might be something else beside colour missing to make it
    really up-to-date / cutting edge - can't tell yu what. (may individual letter
    turned upside down, something you notice at a second glance) but that might be
    the european look at serifs ;-)\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nthomas"

  body: "Thanks a bunch for your comments.\r\n\r\nThe name is supposed to read as
    \"Process Design\", but I am getting mixed interpretations. Any ideas on how I
    can imporove the readability, or should I just leave it alone, and explain it
    to those who miss it? \r\n\r\nI studied the USPS guide to designing mailed pieces,
    i'm not sure what the official name was, quite thouroughly to see if I could make
    it work. I found that the bottom 5/8\"  of a mailed piece are reserved for a postal
    barcode, unless you print one on yourself. I am planning on using an applicaion
    called Addressix <a>http://www.a-sharp.com/addressix/</a>, which has the capability
    to generate them to work around this. Are the return addresses read by machine
    as well?\r\n\r\nWow, facsimile, thanks a million, I would be kicking myself if
    I went to press with that. \r\n\r\nI agree with you on the periods Thomas, they
    really aren't necessary.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help with the color, I am so used
    to projects being printed in 4C process that I tend to keep my text as close to
    100% values as possible. I'm doing a 2C spot on this so I should take advantage
    of the opportunity.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTravis"

  body: "I think it would read unambiguously as \"process design\" if you just turned
    it over.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my recollection, the type nearest to the bottom
    edge of an envelope is interpreted as the destination address. The barcode will
    probably override all of this, but you may still have to put the barcode in the
    designated place."

      had it initially, but everybody said \"Design Process.\" Gancing at it quickly,
      even I would see \"design\" first. \r\n\r\nI'm going to send a test envelope,
      just to be sure it works."
