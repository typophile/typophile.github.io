  ... \r\n\r\nI am helping someone set up a book that he has set in MS Word to be
  converted to a PDF for on-demand, short-run printing.\r\n\r\n<shudder> I know. </shudder>
  \r\n\r\nAnyway, the first part of the title of the book is \"Questioning Circumcision.\"
  The author had set it in Book Antiqua fake small caps. Since it is going into a
  PDF file, I am at least recreating the cover material in Illustrator and am setting
  the title in Palatino Small Caps. But, to my eye, the \"G\" at the end of the word
  \"QUESTIONING\" seems like it is moving away from the rest of the word. I opened
  up the font in FOG and there is no kerning pair for \"NG\" (or \"ng\" since it is
  small caps). \r\n\r\nIs this really a sidebearing problem (if it really is a problem)?
  It's just that in this particular instance, the \"G\" seems to be floating away
  from the rest of the text, whereas, for example, in the word \"HONG\" the spacing
  seems fine.\r\n"

    display font, I believe you have to 'custom' kern caps for display. This is because
    what looks good isn't linear with increasing size, and also caps have to be designed
    to fit the lower case, etc.\r\n\r\nSo I would say, just do it. You can check your
    eye by posting it here and getting feedback.  \r\n\r\n"
