  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Well, I hope this question is not too basic for this forum&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me give you some background. I am a Computer Science student, but have been working with designers for years, thus acquiring a fair share of awareness for good typography and design (I love working with designers, by the way &ndash; the company I work for has a nice working environment and it is nice to collaborate with people that are experts in a different trade). At least I'm more aware than the average CS nerd, I guess <!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I am trying to do is to find a collection of typefaces that I can use for all my personal type-related needs. E.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Letters and invoices (for the occasional consulting gig) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Articles (typeset with LaTeX. Did I mention I'm a nerd?) or even my upcoming diploma thesis <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Headings on my web sites <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Printed music (that is, lyrics and chords) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You could say that I am trying to establish a CI for myself. So how does one go about searching the myriad of haystacks of fonts out there? And how do I come up with a collection of typefaces that actually look good used together? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I guess I also should mention I'm not necessarily looking for freebies here. While I'm on a student budget, I am a firm believer of &quot;a worker is worth his wages&quot;. I enjoy being paid for my (non-GNU) programming work,  and I have a distinct feeling typographers feel the same way <!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I am ready to pay a reasonable price for good fonts. So I hope you will not perceive this as a plea to get free fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks in advance for your help!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I love working with designers <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Me too - they're prettier. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm a CalStateNorthrigde SECS (School of Engineering and Computer Science - cool, huh? :-) grad myself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Generally you'd choose two typefaces, one for body and one for headings/titling. If you want a really austere look you would choose one typeface that's a large family with both text and display cuts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The thing is, you seem to have a lot planned for your CI, in terms of subject matter. The only way to accomodate all the things you list is to go for neutrality, and to me that's a lousy basis for a CI. As much as we think programming is an art as high as music, the general perception does not agree, and a good CI needs to be obliging to its audience, not a primadonna. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I think you should either have groups of fonts you use, or possibly find a font with multiple &quot;persona&quot; of which there aren't many (the recent Siemens face is one, but that's not commercially available). I'm talking the display component here: for the text component it might make sense to play it [relatively] safe and choose something like Adobe's Warnock (which does have different cuts, btw) for all the &quot;groups&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, thanks for the feedback and sorry for the late reply. I can't say much about designers being prettier, since most designers I work with are guys. Don't underestimate the gals in CS, though <!-- raw HTML omitted -->. However, you are right in saying that music and CS are not so easy to combine sometimes. I am still working on it myself <!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am fine with combining different typefaces &ndash; in fact, I believe I won't be able to meet all my needs with just one typeface, and I am definitely not going for austerity. Artistic or expressive would be more like it, I guess.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the meantime, it occurred to me that I will probably need even different body typefaces: Lyrics are usually set sans serifs (am I right?), while I'd use a Serif typeface for a report. Currently, I am using the Sigler Jazzfont (<!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.jazzfont.com">http://www.jazzfont.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) to set music, which is nice for the music and the chords, but too &quot;over the top&quot; for lyrics and directions for anything but Big-Band charts (IMHO). On the other hand, a plain Sans Serif like Arial looks kinda weird combined with it. Is there something that might go well with it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, if anyone wants to recommend their own fonts, feel free to do so!</div>
