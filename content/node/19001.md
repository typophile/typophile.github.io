body: "I've got a problem with an OTF font made in Fontlab (5.01) that just shows
  up invisible once I try and use it. Background info: I had the outlines for the
  font in Illustrator, which I saved as EPS and imported into Fontlab without any
  problems. In Fontlab (and the original outlines in Illustrator) the letters show
  up properly, and even after I export the font as an Opentype PS OTF font it'll render
  it visible in the standard Windows font preview window. But when I try and use it
  in Illustrator or Photoshop it shows up invisible. I've attached a couple of screenshots
  below, which show what it looks like after having been typed and is selected, and
  then when I move it it'll show the letters.. But if I drop it it's back to invisibility.
  I can't for the life of me figure out what's not working. I've tried reversing contours,
  checked for open connections, etc. and I come up empty.. I have the same Fontlab
  settings I've used successfully for everything else too so it can't be that.. So
  now I'm out of ideas and hoping someone else knows what this is caused by.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/invisible1.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/invisible2.png]"

  body: "Have you generated/installed your font once as OpenType-TrueType and once
    as OpenType-PostScript (or the other way round)? Then you should try this: \r\nSearch
    your system partition for \"fnt\" -- if you use Windows, make sure your search
    includes hidden files!\r\nYou will find files named after a pattern like \"AdobeFnt06.lst\"
    or \"AdobeFnt10.lst\". Can be quite many files.\r\nDelete them. (Just to be sure,
    restart.)\r\n\r\nBut I am not sure *if this* is your problem because you say that
    upon moving, glyphs do become visible ...\r\n\r\nHave you tested your font in
    other applications than Adobe's?"

  body: "hey, that worked like a charm! thanks!\r\n\r\nand i did have it as a TTF
    font before, so that must've been it.\r\n\r\noh, and i tried it in a non-Adobe
    application (Flash) before i deleted the lst files and it worked there, so it
    was definitely the Adobe thing that messed it up."
