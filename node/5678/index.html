		<div class="commentbody">I think the tabs are more convenient than separate windows, since they don't clutter your taskbar/dock &ndash; they're all together in the browser where they belong. Of course you can still open multiple Firefox windows if you want to. <BR> <BR>When I want to follow a link without losing my place on the current page, I find it very convenient to open the link in a new tab. Just middle-click the link (assuming your mouse has three buttons or clickable scroll wheel). Whenever I'm forced to use IE, I find myself middle-clicking links out of habit. You can also configure new tabs to load in the background, so you can open pages for later browsing without interruption. There's a Tabbrowser extension that adds tons of other options.  <BR> <BR>I remember hearing of an IE plugin that adds tabbed browsing, but I'm not sure how it compares.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Steve, I like tabbed browsing because I can group my browsing in a subject-oriented manner, rather than in an unsorted mess. <BR> <BR>If someone on typophile links something, I can open it in a tab attached to the originating window, then Cmnd+Tab over to my email window which might have a tab for Hotmail and/or Gmail along with tabs for any links I got in emails. It's nice for research too, since I can run 4 Google searches in 4 windows and open links related to each in tabs under that originating Google search. I find IE to be laborious in contrast. <BR> <BR>This hits on a fundamental difference in the 2 big OSes (mac and windows) as well: logical/hierarchical segmentation. While tabbed browsing is possible in both OSes, in Windows every <i>document</i> gets its own Taskbar item (except in apps like Photoshop), but in Mac OS every <i>app</i> gets its own Dock item, then you can move between documents in the app you choose. There are benefits to both, but I prefer the Mac method of hierarchical segmentation (this isn't an official term, I'm just using it for convenience). Also, OS X allows document windows from different apps to intermingle, so you can pull your Illustrator work to Photoshop without having to move every window out of the way, so it's not too strict about the segmenting (OS 9 does not have this ability). <BR> <BR>I'm not a PC-hater, and I don't use every single widget and feature of my browsers, but even for me IE is behind the curve in a few siginificant ways. And, if I understand correctly, MS is ditching IE anyway (probably so they can just integrate browsing directly into the OS).</div>

I guess it depends on what you mean by 'apps like photoshop'. <BR>As far as I can tell its only IE, plus MS Office applications that give each document its own Taskbar item (even those get documents stacked into a single taskbar item in XP). <BR>Looking at my quicklaunch bar, I don't see any others that have more than one taskbar item for multiple documents.

		<div class="commentbody">True, true. Compatability and sites that only function in IE are the big shot against a lot of these open-source browsers. Safari's <i>pretty</i> good about all that, and will be improving dramatically this fall, from what I hear. Except for a brief spate of IE-only browsing in college, I've <i>always</i> used multiple browsers. So, I guess it's just something I'm used to. <BR> <BR>I certainly have a preference when it comes to OS/hardware, but I use both. I'd probably be Mac-only (at home/home office) if it weren't for gaming and the fact that sometimes things get sent to me in PC-only formats. Also, Macs are more typesetting-friendly, which goes a long way for me. However, I wouldn't be surprised if Longhorn puts an end to a lot of differences in that arena.</div>

Of course IE leads. It always will. As long as corporations by cheap PCs with Windows on them, there will be a large portion of people that HAVE to use IE from 9-5 (whether they actually prefer that browser or not). <BR> <BR>The incorrect assumption is that 95% of web users use IE 100% of the time as their preferred browser. <BR> <BR>&quot;Used in the sense or portability between browsers, accessibility does require significantly more effort to implement in many websites. &quot; <BR> <BR>I'm sorry, Steve, but that is just wrong. You design to standards, fix a few layout bugs in IE, and you're up and running. Accessibility is accessibility. When designing with accessibility in mind (a core part of good web design IMHO) then the browser issue is resolved along the way. <BR> <BR>HTML is HTML. Javascript is Javascript. CSS is CSS. Designing with those tools, you can go a long way. Again, there's a few hiccups in IE/PC that you need to design around, but these aren't budget-doubling issues. Just small annoyances that&ndash;if you know about them&ndash;you can easily design around. <BR> <BR>This is really no different than in the real world. Building an accessible house isn't prohibitively more expensive. It does take a tad more planning. But once you know the jist of accessible design, it becomes a non-issue. <BR> <BR>&quot;Why do you think that you see so many websites which list only IE and some 4th gen version of NN as supported browsers?&quot; <BR> <BR>Because there are a LOT of crappy, lazy web development firms that screw their clients&hellip;along with a LOT of crappy, old, out-of-date web sites. For whatever reason, a Fortune 500 company wouldn't dream of publishing an AR with an out-of-gamut photo, but thinks nothing of having their web site be completely inaccessible. <BR> <BR>&quot;he reason is that its just prohibitively expensive to test large functional websites on every browser/OS combination.&quot; <BR> <BR>I can't argue you on this point. That's simply wrong. It takes me all of 5 minutes to test in all the major browsers. Plus, you don't NEED to test in EVERY browser&hellip;you just need to make sure it's accessible.  <BR> <BR>&quot;But the important thing about a browser, to me, is that I can use the sites I want to use. &quot; <BR> <BR>Oh sure. No argument there. I'm just trying to make it clear that the reason there are a lot of IE-only sites is predominantly due to lazy/incompetant developers&hellip;rather than the myth that it's difficult to develop accessible web sites. (FYI, Firefox can spoof its useragent, so you can get around a lot of sloppy browser detection scripts fairly easily.) <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Steve: <BR> <BR>I know where those stats are from. My point which I may not have made clear is that those are simply browser stats. They say nothing about the preferences of an actual user. I use IE day-in, day-out at work. I hate it. But I have to use it. So, when I visit sites, I'm logged as an 'IE/PC' user, when, in fact, I'm much more of a 'Firefox/Mac' user.  <BR> <BR>There isn't a lot of statistics based on this. I did a bit of research once and found a few folks that had access to large national web sites and were able to break down stats by time of day. After 5, they'd see a 5% swing in the amount of Mac users, for example.  <BR> <BR>&quot;And in what way is it relevant if someone is not using the browser they want to use?&quot; <BR> <BR>If you go on those generic browser stats alone, you'll lock out some of your audience. If Mary logs into your site at noon to buy something with IE/PC great, you made a sale. When she gets home to buy another item, but you block her because she uses Firefox, well, you lost a sale&hellip;even though you pegged her as an IE/PC user. <BR> <BR>&quot;Obviously, because there are no bugs in any other browsers&hellip;and they all implement flawless standards flawleslly <BR>Meanwhile back in the real world&hellip;&quot; <BR> <BR>What are you talking about, Steve? Did I say browsers had no bugs? Like I said, design to standards, fix the layout bugs in IE. Are there other bugs? Sure&hellip;but nothing major that will affect your site 99% of the time. If you have examples of this big Mozilla bugs that are a hindrance, please share them. <BR> <BR>&quot;1. What's a major browser? &quot; <BR> <BR>Windows: IE 5+, latest Opera, Latest Mozilla(S), NN4 (I still check that one).  <BR> <BR>OSX: Latest Safari, Latest Mozilla(s), Latest Opera, Latest Omniweb <BR> <BR>OS9: IE5 (blech) <BR> <BR>Linux: Konquerer <BR> <BR>Other: A text browser, JAWS, etc. <BR> <BR>&quot;2. Five minutes. What kind of web site is that? &quot; <BR> <BR>Pretty much any. It takes me less than 5 minutes to run my page through all of the above browsers. <BR> <BR>Again, if you're designing to standards, it's even less of a deal. When you do that, the only odd-ones out are IE/PC, IE/Mac and NN4&hellip;which there are plenty of well documented workarounds for their quirks. <BR> <BR>I'm not trying to bash you Steve&hellip;I'm just trying to dispell the common myth that you (and many many others) perpetuate. This is part of the problem why you have to keep IE on your computer. Microsoft has developed a nice little catch-22 with their browser. Everyone uses because there are so many sites only developed with IE in mind. There are so many sites only developed with IE in mind because so many developers assume everyone uses IE on windows. This has pretty much enabled MS to not have to worry about fixing a badly broken and rather insecure browser.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm really surprised to hear about certain sites not being usable with Firefox. I haven't fired up IE since I switched over a few months ago, and I've never had a problem with any site: banks, forums, whatever. And I can't see any reason why I should. It's IE that's the 'problem browser' &ndash; you have to deviate from standards-compliance to make certain sites work with IE, not the other way around. <BR> <BR>And Hrant: so far as I remember Thunderbird will automatically import mailboxes and address books from pretty much anywhere. Bearing in mind that all of the Mozilla stuff is ultimately derived from Netscape code, I can't imagine even NS4 would be a problem (although is it a different core, ie not Gecko? I can't remember) &hellip; <BR> <BR>R <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, the idea with the Thunderbird/Firefox stuff (both parts of the SeaMonkey project) is that it's essentially a kind of modularised Mozilla, so you're not downloading and using one monolithic do-it-all application, but lightweight, fast programs that do one thing well. So Thunderbird doesn't as such 'come with' Firefox, but it's the mailreading arm of the SeaMonkey project. There are other side-projects, all being developed by community, such as the Sunbird calendar, which can also integrate with Thunderbird (although the last time I tried it it was still awful buggy). <BR> <BR>And yeah, I can testify that the spam filtering in Thunderbird is great. From about ten a day I now get about one a month slipping through, and no false positives so far. <BR> <BR>Steve &ndash; if you have the time (maybe a spare five minutes) you could report your non-working sites  on the Firefox <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewforum.php?f=9&amp;sid=7aeddd06e7d74ea63ad4090358e80d9a" target="_blank">forums</a>? It's easier than filing a full bug report (for which you need to be using the latest nightly build etc.) and the developers do seem to read the forums.

I'd simply argue that it's USUALLY an issue of lazy web development (whether that be the developers, project management, upper management, etc.). <BR> <BR>&quot;Often its down to budgets. And in the real world of corporate web development where testing takes place during and after development, it is a crucial and significant part of the development budget, which does influence which browsers/devices are supported. &quot; <BR> <BR>I agree that that *is* a common excuse&hellip;but it's not usually (though it is sometimes) valid, as developing cross-browser web sites, provided the developers know what they're doing, doesn't cost more. <BR> <BR>We simply disagree on this point. So be it. ;o) ;o) <BR> <BR>To be fair, part of the problem is the toolset given the developers. I do a lot of .net development these days and, surprise, surprise, .net favours IE on the front-end. So I need to go in and develop my own front-end interfaces for most widgets rather than depending on .net's built in widgets.  <BR> <BR>I've worked with CMS tools that also favour only one specific browser. So, if the base set of tools is already flawed, then it's hard to blame the developers that need to work with said tool (though I could blame the folks that decided on that particular technology. ;o)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;i have been using mozilla for over a year and it's very smooth. you can't use windowsupdate though. <BR>havent tried out firefox yet. the thing with mozilla is that it is very steady, you can open up 20 pages at the same time and know it won't crash or anything. as for tabs, they are essential. i used to  open links in new windows with ie, but the bigger mouse trip to the taskbar and the untidiness of the whole deal made it a bad experience. the mail&amp;newsgroups program is just a click away. only thing that is not perfect is the download manager - you still need a good external download manager (netvampire, getright, dap or whatever else). you cant even trust it for a resume! <BR> <BR>and btw, since there is this talk of &quot;buggy sites&quot; and crappy web developing, is it just me or are all tables of typophile forums set to a standard width of 768 pixels? i am currently working on 800x600 and get an horizontal scroller and have to scroll to the right to read a whole line of a post. Shouldn't it be like width=&quot;100%&quot;?&lt;/font&gt;</div>

This forum technology leaves a lot to be desired. Fortunately, there's enough good folks/content in here to make the bugs tolerable. ;o)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's kinda funny, but Firefox is the ONLY browser that works properly for my wife in whatever forums she goes to. She said IE and NN never worked, but this one (firefox) was displaying things and allowing her to post correctly. Go figure! <BR></div>
