  body: "Close! Surprisingly so.\r\n\r\nA young black man (and who ever he gets up
    with), by way of London Eng., EMI up and comer. He had the nerve to get one of

    mind - oozing its way forward - are some traditional somber analogous urban camo
    colour themes I want to explore ...perhaps something pearly grey.\r\n\r\nn."
