  body: Funny because I'm pretty convinced of the opposite. It looks hand-done as
    all repeating letters are different. See [[http://www.cabocado.com/collections/frontpage/products/cape-cod-beach-tote|here]]
    for more previews.

  body: "EDITED:\r\nHas a circa 1950 style. IMHO definitely folk art not a font.\r\nReminds
    me of various restaurant place mats I saw at New England coastal locations in
    the 1970s. Warren's Lobster House, Captain Cod's Shack etc.\r\nI am unable to
    say whether this is a vintage design or a newer creation in retro style but inclusion
    of the DSV Alvin -- see lower left hand corner of the full image and same sketch
    shown in top banner of webpage -- means that it can be no older than 1964 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSV_Alvin\r\n\r\nDon"
