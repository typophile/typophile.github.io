  body: y&#39;no I had a spread sheet of Zanzibar out of Applied Arts mag taped up
    to the fridge during christmas - our pseudo santa list &#40;the fridge door&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Zanzibar didn&#39;t make it - the people in the house just don&#39;t
    understand and thought I&#39;d get more of a kick from the new socks &#40; I did
    have lots of socks on the list&#41;  <BR> <BR>anyway - thanks alot for the list
    eh. Its a suggestion I wanted to put into myfonts.com...dingbats and all - I search
    for specific ones way too often without noting. <BR> <BR>you guys hit it.
