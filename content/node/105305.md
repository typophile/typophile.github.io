body: "Hello \r\n\r\nWe are currently using a mix of Stag, Stag Sans for our materials
  (large type brochures, letters and Keynote presentations), as well as 'whatever
  is at hand' for emails and web (e.g. MS Trebuchet)\r\n\r\nThe recent availability
  of Stag as a 'direct' web font has opened the opportunity to unify our communications
  as well as look & feel. We would like, in particular to unify letters, web and email
  using the same font set.\r\n\r\nI have tested Stag (headlines) + Stag Sans (body)
  for web and it looks quite good. However Stag Sans is still not ideal for everyday
  body text: punctuation a bit too tight and doesn't do numbers particularly well
  (e.g. for invoicing).\r\n\r\nWe are going to keep the Stag family as our headline
  font (and license it for the web) but I would like some ideas on what other body
  font we could use. The constraints are fairly basic:\r\n\r\n- High legibility for
  both print and screen\r\n- Native web fonts\r\n- Either directly suitable for email
  or can easily be replaced by something not too shockingly different\r\n\r\nI had
  a look at FF Meta Serif for example and quite liked it, but it doesn't seem to exist
  as a native web font.\r\n\r\nPS: I am not worked up about serif v. sans. \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    opentype version for it? This font might be not hinted properly so it looks too
    tight in web use. \r\n\r\nContact Commercialtype, their font technician, named
    Mark, is friendly and helpful. I\u2019m pretty sure he can provide you with a
    test site with Stag Sans in use.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFlorian"

  body: "There is no way to correct tight spacing with hinting on modern Windows systems.
    The fonts needs to be drawn wider and spaced looser prior to hinting*. Check out
    the Reading Edge series from Webtype, Aften Screen (mine) from Monokrom or the
    eText fonts from Monotype for examples of this approach.\r\n\r\nFF Meta Serif
    is available for web use on <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/ff_meta_serif/All/All/Bestsellers/2\">fontshop.com</a>.
    Click add, and select the web option. FF Meta Serif Web Pro is also one of the
    teaser families FontFont offer through <a href=\"https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-meta-serif-web-pro\">Typekit</a>.\r\n\r\n*
    Low resolutions screens need looser spacing for text sizes than what is ideal
    for print. I think text on the Apple Retina screen also look better with some
    extra white."

  body: "@moscool, just drop them a line on their official email address. They will
    help you. Don\u2019t noticed this webfont example before. Stag is indeed pretty
    tight spaced. \r\n\r\n@Frode Bo Helland, sure, hinting and spacing are two different
    parts. But webfonts are in general (in the best case) a little bit spaced and
    properly hinted."
