  body: The E&#43;F version is supposed to have the alternate cut,  <BR>which might
    include the swashy &#34;s&#34;. I think the star is  <BR>custom though. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif"
    border=0> <BR> <BR><i>An elegant, free-flowing copperplate script style  <BR>designed
    by renowned British designer Martin Wait.  <BR>Generous initial capitals compliment
    the more  <BR>restrained lower case letters that join for balanced  <BR>letter
    spacing in word settings. Excellent for certificates,  <BR>citations, diplomas
    and greeting card applications.</i> <BR> <BR>I hate it when people tell me what
    to do with my type...

    the rather stupid Flash previews that E&#43;F have implemented on their current
    site. The alternate cut doesn&#39;t have the swash &#39;s&#39; as expected, just
    a bit of variation in the way the characters are connected together and some of
    the tails on the descenders. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14505.gif"
