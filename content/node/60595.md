  body: "I searched the MyFonts collection and the most similar I found was Ray Larabie's
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/wevli/|Wevli]]. My guess is that your
    sample is a custom designed logo font. It resembles Dax and Isonorm, but even
    less than the other font I picked, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
