  <BR>&#40;I&#39;m excluding faces like Dax and Prokyon as they employ a different

    the bowl stroke are you meaning? <BR> <BR>Such an intersection can run the gamut
    from a hard turn to a smooth radius &#40;with the Banjoman non-terminating example
    being somewhere midway in the range of possibilities&#41;. <BR> <BR>A stencil-like
    break at the top d intersection - or at the baseline with p - adds more balancing
    complexity. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a list of our Treacyfaces fonts with non-terminating
    main strokes on both d and p, or one of those characters: <BR> <BR>TF Alambic
    &#40;d only&#41; <BR>TF Avian &#40;p only, although a close call&#41; <BR>TF Burko
    &#40;both&#41; <BR>TF Foxfire &#40;both&#41; <BR>TF Gary &#40;both&#41; <BR>TF
    Roux &#40;both&#41; <BR>TF Vignette &#40;both, although a close call&#41; <BR>
    <BR> <BR>All can be seen at  <BR><a href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html</a> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62;&#40;...&#41;I&#39;m
    interested in this practice  <BR>&#62;but remain skeptical because to my eye  <BR>&#62;the
    d tends to float along the baseline  <BR>&#62;without the termination stroke.
    <BR> <BR> <BR>I always find that it&#39;s a design balancing act. But one that
    can be achieved if one proceeds very carefully. <BR> <BR>Of course, the interaction
    with other characters in the design is highly important.  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    not to say that it&#39;s more crucial than in faces where there are more &#39;usual&#39;
    stem terminations. <BR> <BR>The interaction just needs to be watched carefully,
    to avoid the optical bounce. In general, if it&#39;s not a non-aligning face,
    and it appears to have noticable bounce, then it would probably be safe to say
    that it wasn&#39;t designed properly. <BR> <BR>Even in faces like our TF Vignette,
    or another mentioned example, Linotype Banjoman, it&#39;s a matter of testing
    to see how high or low the join ought to be to look most pleasing &#40;most innocuous,
    really&#41; to the eye. <BR> <BR>I think it can be a very useful affectation.
    <BR> <BR>However, it seems to me that what the technique can contribute to the
    lower left corner of b is a more thorny issue.  <BR> <BR>Much more often, if it&#39;s
    not handled well in that very delicate spot, it&#39;s easy to permanently wound
    an entire typeface. <BR> <BR>Joe <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'You know, I completely neglected to mention one of my favorites: <BR> <BR>Ozwald
    Bruce Cooper&#39;s aparently unnamed brush letter &#40;1930&#41;, the roman of
    which is shown on pp.158-159 of &#39;The Book of Oz Cooper&#39;, The Society of
    Typographic Arts, Chicago, 1949.  <BR> <BR>Done originally just for a 1930 Harper
    &amp; Brothers book called &#39;American Alphabets&#39;, by Paul Hollister. <BR>
    <BR>What&#39;s especially fascinating about this is how Cooper devised the completely
    different way of terminal joining.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if there was ever
    a name assigned to the technique &#40;which seems to be all Cooper&#39;s&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>But it&#39;s rather like a negative terminal, or a low terminal. Ending flat
    &#40;effectively&#41;, but with the bowl joining very low away from the x-height.  <BR>
    <BR>Without sacrificing the round of the bowl &#40;round as in Bernhard Gothic&#39;s&#41;
    at all. Rather, accentuating it. <BR> <BR>Astonishing, really. <BR> <BR>Talk about
    a set of drawings that&#39;ll make your eyes roll back! <BR> <BR>I know that A&#42;I
    revived it as A&#42;I Oz Brush about 1990. But it appears to be somewhat different
    from what I can tell from Font Book specimens. Perhaps it&#39;s a little haphazard?
    Hard to tell whether it was fully true to the brushed spontaneity of Cooper&#39;s
    masterpiece. <BR> <BR>I wonder if anyone knows whether Hollister&#39;s publishing
    of his book introducing Cooper&#39;s letter predated the release of Bernhard Gothic?  <BR>
