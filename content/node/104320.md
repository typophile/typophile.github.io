    but the differences are still too prominent... I'll keep it in mind for a last

    like an @ss:</strong>\r\nI need only the \"square\" font for what I need to do,
    you don't know where I can find that font by any chance?\r\nIt's for a concept
    that I would like to present to a potential client, but dropping 100 dollars on
    a font is way out of my budget!\r\n\r\nCan anyone help?\r\n"

    Square</a> alone or look for the initial demo/beta version Antrepo released a
    while back.
