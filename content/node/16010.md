  the subject.\r\nI just wanted to announce that I have a book coming out at the end
  of the month on the subject of package design, published by Thomson Delmar Learning
  Publishing. \r\nhttp://www.delmarlearning.com/\r\nIt's the result of years of research
  and study and about a year and a half of actual writing. You can learn more about
  it at http://isbn.nu/cgi-bin/isbnbookcover?isbn=1401872174\r\nI'm pretty excited.\r\n\r\nChuck"

  body: It will be available everywhere, as far as I know. Borders, Barnes and Noble,
    Amazon.com, and through the publisher. But a search I did a few minutes ago showed
    several sites around the globe the book's available through.

    have told you already, I know, but add my name to the list.

  body: "Chuck,\r\n\r\nGood luck with your book! It must feel really awesome for you
    to release a book after all that hard work and research. If I ever get to design
    packaging I'll make sure to buy a copy."

  body: Thanks, Lauri. I appreciate it. It's a great feeling to be DONE with it. When
    my book proposal was accepted, the Acquisitions Editor called. "I've got good
    news, and bad news," he said. "The good news is, we really want to publish your
    book. The bad news is, now you have to write it!" He was joking, of course, but
    it was a much larger undertaking than I had anticipated.
