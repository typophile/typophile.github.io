      out. Any other suggestions. \r\n\r\nApologies for the pixelated ref but its
      all I got."

    I recreated the whole thing, see below.\r\n\r\nWhat makes you think it isn't?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TMG_5804.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TMG_5891.png]"

      apex of the M that is throwing me, although this could be due to the image quality.\r\n\r\nCheers
