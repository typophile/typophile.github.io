body: 'This is a cover I haven been working on for a long time. It is an Australian
  man&#39;s life in India and Afganistan in the early 1980s. It&#39;s a very long
  and interesting book that hopefuly will prove popular. I am happy with the image
  but not the typography. We&#39;re trying to achieve the dream: mass-market not down-market
  and easily recognisable. I thought with these requirements everyone&#39;s experience
  with logos might help. Thank you!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6562.jpg"

  body: If it&#39;s just a matter of degrees, you might consider Matthew Carter&#39;s
    Mantinia in place of the Galliard caps. It&#39;s similar, but a little more exotic
    looking. Mantinia was designed as a titling companion to Galliard.  <BR> <BR><img

  body: 'Good call, Kent. Mantinia was my first thought too &#40;although this might
    suggest that it&#39;s a little obvious&#41;. Another good option would be the
    titling weight of HTF Requiem, which could also be used for the author&#39;s name.
    The text weight could be used for the tag line at the top, although it&#39;s really
    a bit naff: The Man. The Life. The Novel. The Ego. The Cheese.'

  body: Its a typographical proportion problem, not a typeface problem. The position
    of the title is too low and the SHANTARAM text zone is equal to the author zone.  <BR>not
    enough space on each side of the title, and too much space inside the title. <BR>
    <BR>Perhaps, the word structure is not at its best in all caps setting &#40;very
    angular and difficult to space&#41;. Switch author name in caps -- title in lowercases.

  body: I really dig the halftone mandala-esque design in the middle. <BR> <BR>You
    might want to reduce the size of the author&#39;s name. I agree with Jean -- it&#39;s
    fighting with the title.

  body: I agree with Jean about reversing the caps and lc treatments. I also agree
    with an earlier comment about choosing a bit more flourished face for the title
    or employing ligatures in an lc setting. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know if this is
    up for discussion, but I think the tagline doesn&#39;t belong on the cover. I&#39;m
    not one for taglines on book covers to begin with, but in particular I think this
    one is a bit cliched and detracts from the opportunity to let the image &#40;which
    is lovely, by the way&#41; and the title shine.

  body: One suggestion I would make is the bring in the tracking of the authors name,
    its really quite taboo to widely track lc characters.

  body: Thanks for your responses. I&#39;ll look into them and post some of my changes.
    Although I don&#39;t write the tag line or have to like it &#40;or the title for
    that matter&#41;. The only major control I have had so far is in creating the
    central image.   Thanks again though for the constructive criticism. Working on
    your own it is hard to get outside your own head sometimes!

    got printed was the one that most people &#40;ie author, marketing, publisher
    etc&#41; were happy with. I still may snaffle that mandala-type thing I did for
    something else though. <BR> <BR>

    probably have a completely different cover and inside layout <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
    ALT=":-&#40;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Which isn&#39;t always bad, considering I much
    prefer the American Harry Potter illustrations and layout to the British versions,
    though I wish they didn&#39;t edit the language. <BR> <BR>But sometimes, for covers
    like this, it sucks when they change it.
