body: "Hello all, I am new to the Typophile site and was really impressed with the
  professional look, not to mention the love of typography you all seem to share,
  as I do.\r\n\r\nA little about me, \r\n\r\nI've been around. Started my career at
  a early age running a offset press, moved onto photography, where I stayed for 16
  years running my own studio. Became jaded with the whole still image thing and moved
  to my next desire, Graphic design. I love it, love my Mac and all the wonderful
  stuff you can do using Adobe software. I am presently an art director at a nice
  little branding shop doing all the things I love. \r\n\r\nAll that aside, I remember
  back in the day when being a commercial artist, designer, photographer etc. meant
  something. Not that you were treated like a god, you were a talented person with
  unique capabilities, as the respect followed. You were payed well for what you did
  and were responsible for your time as long as the deadline was met and everyone
  was happy and got along.\r\n\r\nNow, here's what I found after playing the freelance
  game for the last 6 years. Granted I was a lowly freelancer but I found that the
  industry on a whole has turned the respectful advertising game into a bean counters
  delight! I found that creative was dictated by account suites with the help of a
  art director and time-sheets and meta data  were the mission of the day. Once was
  a witty chat about creative direction has turned into a ego swinging tantrum brought
  on by fear and inexperience, where on more that one occasion when I got involved,
  I was escorted to the main lobby.\r\n\r\nLuckily I have found a nice little niche
  where I can do what I do best, work everyday, be creative, play golf every now and
  then and be paid fairly for what I do. As far as the agencies go, well no thanks,
  it's just to disappointing.\r\n\r\nPlease pass on your thoughts, hopefully I have
  opened a can of worms and just maybe, something will change.\r\n\r\nGood luck to
  all.\r\n\r\nmoi\r\n\r\nP.S. Sorry for the typesetting but it seems to be out of
  my control\r\n\r\n\r\n"
