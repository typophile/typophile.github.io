  client uses Klavika as their corporate font. I'm not sure if I should just use Klavika
  for the body text - it might get a bit much \u2013 or look at something else. \r\nThe
  client would prefer to stay with a sans serif.\r\nAny recommendations much appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: ' [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/vista_slab/|Vista Slab]] is
    another slab serif -- which, being a bit sans-like, I can imagine the client being
    talked into even though they prefer sans -- and I think it captures some of the
    verticality of Klavika. Adelle looks like a nicer face in its own right though
    IMHO. I''d also consider [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/theserif_classic/|TheSerif]].'
