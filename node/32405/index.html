  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">While Googling the name of Helvetica's designer, Max Miedinger, I came upon <a href="http://suzyriceimage.com/AUTOBIOGRAPHY_2.html" target="_blank">this startling account</a> by Susan Elizabeth (Suzy) Rice, creator of the Star Wars logo.

If her words are to be taken literally, then Joseph Goebbels designed a typeface! I'm thinking that perhaps he gave the order to start using sans serif faces, but as far as designing a face himself... Sheesh. Does anyone have information on this, or any idea what book about German type design Ms. Rice might be referring to? (And Gary Hustwit, do you have any thoughts on this?)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have read most of that (rambling…) post by Ms Rice & there are a lot of inaccuracies in there. Especially about the Nazi's having designed the forerunner of Helvetica. (BTW The german spelling of Helvetica is Helvetica and NOT Helvetika).
Another miss: the alleged authorship of the early Disney-cartoons. It is widely accepted nowadays that Mr Disney's collaborators had a greater part that they got credited for, especially Ub Iwerks who gave life to Mickey Mouse.
My conclusion: it's a lot of b*llsh*t.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">im not really sure how much this scheltersche-helvetica-link is a PR-story to sell FF Bau and how much it is really worth. when looking at the german specimen book that is available to me (a fat one by bauersche schriftgiesserei around 1900), many grotesks at that time (or earlier, in the 1880ies) could've been a precedessor to helvetica, altough they're wackier than scheltersche. but then again, why look 70 years from the starting point of helvetica, why not a bit less and look at AG?

but im by no way an expert myself, so this is all speculation and i would be very interested in hearing eriks extended view of this issue, and why exactly he thinks scheltersche grotesk is the father of helvetica.

Here's a still from the film, of Haas' original trials of Neue Haas Grotesk. Akzidenz Grotesk one line, Neue Haas Grotesk the next. I've seen a fair amount of the materials associated with the creation of Helvetica, and AG was the only other typeface I saw in this context.

He grabbed the crap shareware "Star Wars" typeface off of God-knows-where and used it for his piece. The history he showed mentioned that it was a variation of Helvetica Black.

Harking back to that Typographica discussion, I too was skeptical of her explanation. But I have the Star Wars DVD set with all the extras and, sure enough, they did use an outlined Helvetica Black in the early ads, not the famous logo. I think she really did start with that, redrawing it by eye, taking some liberties with the forms, stylizing this and that, and ended up with something quite different. </div>

But thank the Force it was before the Trajan invasion.
The block sans mod (especially version 2 with the ligatures), owes something to Ed Benguiat's Planet of the Apes logo.

		<div class="commentbody">A Very old thread, but still relevant.
It seems many have questioned Suzi Rice's claim to the authorship of the star wars logo...
There are strong questions concerning her grasp, or mastery of type and it's derivations.
There is an absolute disconnect of the present, pridefully posted, yet disastrous work, and that of 1977's star wars logo.  
It is incongruous for the artistic direction behind a successful design to have to argue for pages with such indirect, and circumstantial references.  
Her need for credit is clear,  but her claims amount to hearsay.   She lacks the ease or control of a confident designer, as exhibited by her choice of arguments.  
She is making a desperate claim to an artistry obviously just beyond her own graphic ability.  
Her on-line portfolio proves her inability to differentiate quality.
Looking back into her bio page...  I noticed that her husband of that era was Tony Lane.  The plot thickens...He might've known something about type?

		<div class="commentbody">It's worth noting that the Star Wars logo's typeface-style borrowing from Planet of the Apes's typeface style may not be serendipitous. Star Wars was perhaps the most thoroughly marketed science-fiction film up until the time of its release. The previous record holder was Planet of the Apes. The folks marketing Star Wars studied Planet of the Apes's marketing campaign when they were designing their own campaign, so they would have been heavily exposed to that logo.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@ Nick Shinn - 25.Mar.2007 10.52am

That "receding perspective" Star Wars logo on that poster you've displayed there (second from top) was the logo that was drawn by Dan Perri.

The logo I drew is presented in that additional poster you presented, third from the top (or, the last one presented at the bottom of your stack of images).

Dan Perri was contracted to design the titles(*) for the film ("Star Wars" later titled "Star Wars, Episode IV...").  Thus, that receding perspective logo he drew; which, however, didn't work visually for George when he applied it to the screen, in the title treatment.

Thus, the logo (last poster in your stack there) I drew for the Exhibitor's Bid Brochure ("STAR WARS" stacked on two lines), which George liked, he used to replace Perri's logo.  That's how my logo ended up being the main title treatment and, of course, trademarked in use for the entire film episodes, all, as also marketing of the film, etc.

I also designed a poster for John Williams and touring symphony performance of the soundtrack, which George liked and used as Christmas cards for Lucasfilm later, as also some marketing elements I designed later once the logo I designed/drew was just about everywhere used for everything.

(*) titles for a film, or, a "title treatment" is the visual stream of typed information that is embedded in a motion picture to present a film's credits;

Whereas, a "logo" is the name or title of a film only.

Thus, a title treatment INCLUDES a logo or title-in-type but also includes the full array of credit information, and is a "treatment" or type of animation-of-sorts that is embedded in a film (how the typed information is designed to show visually, etc., a "treatment" of "title").</div>

		<div class="commentbody">According to MyFonts, Schelter Grotesk was originally called Breite Grotesk, and appeared "in the 1886 specimen book of the Schelter & Giesecke foundry". The specimen there does look more like Helvetica than Akzidenz Grotesk does.

However, the original Breite Grotesk seems not to have been identical to the the Schelter Grotesk specimen on MyFonts:

[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/20994543@N04/4552638955/]]

Instead, that looks simply like many of the other sans-serif faces of the same period, without much that suggests, at least to my untrained eye, that it is a precursor of Helvetica, which differs in important ways from the old Grotesques.</div>

Very entertaining. Thanks!

"I write, “popularly accredited to” Goebbels because Goebbels POPULARIZED THE USE of a typeface that was later copyritten in design by Swiss font designer, Max Miedinger. The font, without copyright nor author attribution, was plastered all over Germany by Goebbels"

So would anyone have a problem with "Windsor, popularly accredited to Woody Allen" or "Comic Sans, popularly accredited to Dan Gilbert"?</div>

I love it. 

I'm sorry you think that the users of this site aren't grounded in "drawing things by hand and talking to one another while reading books". While there are a few here who do fit your description, for the most part people who participate on Typophile are in fact deeply versed in the written lore of design and typography, and revel in the hidden first hand account of the creation of a logo or typeface.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I doubt that Goebbels ever even considered designing a typeface. It would not fit his personality, for all I know about him. Has anyone here read his diaries? He was a very vain man, I am sure he would have mentioned such an endeavor.</div>
