body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI was looking for a foundry/ face that has a very organic, eroded
  feel to it. I've been searching around and ran across a few, but I would like to
  see what some other trained eyes could suggest. I really like a few of the characters
  in [[http://www.dafont.com/santos-dumont.font|Santos DuMont]] set, but the overall
  set isn't what I was looking for. Thanks for any suggestions!!\r\n\r\nL"

  body: thanks Frank! I already have Cezanne and that was actually a face that I was
    considering to show in my mock ups. However I was looking for a face that wasn't
    as 'scripty' to have some variation. Thanks again for the quick reply!
