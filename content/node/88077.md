  body: "Ascenderfonts sell some pre-digital typefaces for 20USD per weight. Those
    pre-digital ones there have however only around 250 glyphs, other typeface-vendors
    give you the full character-set and ask for the full money. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Andreas:
    the one you linked yourself.\r\n\r\nSorry to be offtopic here, but I have to say
    I came to realize that Andron is one of a kind. One would think that the market
    for renaissance and baroque typefaces (equals (?) old style) is saturated. However,
    besides the wide character set I find Andron unique in its design, as (1) it has
    both character to the individual glyph, as well a harmonic appearance on a page
    and it is not too reductionistic it its drawing. Some recent text serif typefaces,
    although well balanced and harmonic, are somehow generic, as they are too \u201Cdigitally
    conceived\u201D in a way. Plus (2), I love how the \u201Cf\u201D is both beautiful
    and does not create collision with non-english characters."

  body: "Are you going to print this letterpress? This makes a big difference. If
    you are going to print it letter press, then one of the classic metal faces that
    look anemic in offset printing will probably be good in polymer letter press:
    such as digital [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bembo/|Bembo]], or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/electra-lh/Electra|Electra]].
    Otherwise, you might want to use a font that was popular in letter press, and
    has been re-done to emulate letter press, such as [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bembo-book/|Bembo
    Book]] or [[http://www.linotype.com/795518/parkinsonelectraregular-font.html|Parkinson
    Electra]], though I'm not sure whether the latter is beefy enough. I might mention
    also [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|my own Caslon revival]],
    [[http://ilovetypography.com/2010/07/26/reviving-caslon-the-snare-of-authenticity/|discussed
    here]], which is meant to capture the feeling of the letter press versions of
    Caslon at text sizes.  \r\n\r\n"

    in mind, the poster is best advised, IMHO, to select a type Of the era, as opposed
    to type imitating type Of the era."
