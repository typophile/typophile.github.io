  body: ' Anders, your thoughts on old-style numerals are exactly the type of thing
    many more designers should be going through. Instead, most people are too afraid/lazy/dumb
    to challenge convention, and we&#39;re stuck with the non-sensical stuff we keep
    seeing. <BR> <BR>One could argue that keeping the old convention in numeral design
    is important because readers are already used to it. But really, do we expect
    readers to notice and even react adversely to something as subtle as making the
    &#34;2&#34; ascending, for example? On the contrary, I think the functional and
    aesthetic advantages of improved design could play positive roles in the reader&#39;s
    subconscious. <BR> <BR>Part of the problem is if/when you try to license your
    work to a font house, they enforce their own beliefs/needs on the design. This
    is understandable, and much can be learned from the experience of font houses,
    but to me it&#39;s one more reason to go completely independent. <BR> <BR>Conventional
    numerals suffer from two main things: <BR> <BR>1. The distribution of contrast
    &#40;stroke thickness&#41; is erratic and inconsistent. Gill tried to address
    this, but I for one don&#39;t like the results. In November I will post my own
    efforts to this list, and see what you guys think. <BR> <BR>2. The &#34;extenderness&#34;
    of some numerals does not seem to be based on solid reasoning, at least not solid
    in this day and age. As you allude to, the numerals are too descending overall.
    <BR> <BR>In the case of #1, I think more people should be trying to either: make
    the emphasis of &#42;all&#42; the numerals horizontal; or &#40;preferably&#41;
    align the emphasis of all the numerals to the vertical of the alphabetic glyphs.
    <BR> <BR>In the case of #2, I personally think the &#34;3&#34; and &#34;5&#34;
    work much better when sitting on the baseline&#42;, and the &#34;2&#34; should
    ascend as well. As for the zero, I&#39;m undecided.  :-/ <BR> <BR>&#42; Note that
    some old French foundries used to so this. <BR> <BR>Also, the conventional numeral
    &#34;4&#34; is a disaster. <BR> <BR>BTW, concerning your statement that &#34;this
    is not a completely new invention&#34;: Maybe your efforts are not an &#34;invention&#34;
    &#40;very very few things really are&#41;, but the mental path you&#39;re taking
    is significant because it&#39;s both important and disregarded. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    a free utility by Mark Leisher &#40;called XBDF? Check the OpenType discussion
    list archives&#41; that lets you design bitmaps and output BDFs. I think even
    in grayscale. And as a last resort, you can always write out a BDF by hand, since

    <BR> <BR>However, is the condensed middle-size &#34;7&#34; supposed to be ascending,

  body: 'FWIW, though it takes some repetitive button-pushing, I&#39;ve managed to
