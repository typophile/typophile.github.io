  I would like to use this font for the textual part of a corporate logo however I
  do not know if its license allow me to do that! I know (from Wikipedia) that some
  big companies such as Wal-Mart. I tried to contact Adobe but after three weeks I
  still did not even have a reply!! Do not know where else to ask.\r\n\r\nThanks and
  Regards,\r\nSim085"

    to allow you to create corporate logos from most any font.\r\n\r\nIn otherwords,
    unless the license specifically prohibits it, you should be fine.\r\n\r\nSomeone
    please correct me if I am wrong."

  body: "Hi again,\r\n\r\nFirst of all thank you for the replies. I personally read
    the 'Adobe Standard License Agreement\u200F' and I did not find anything that
    prohibits me from using the font for a corporate logo. However there are some
    legal terms which I could not understand and I do not wish to develop the logo
    and then later on find out that I cannot use it.\r\n\r\nThe logo will be mostly
    text based with some minor modifications on two letters. The modifications would
    not be done on the font files I purchase (which is obviously illegal) but by using
    the font in a graphical application such as Adobe Illustrator and then do the
    modifications in a graphical way.\r\n\r\nFirst of all I tried to contact Adobe
    through their Customer Support Portal. Usually I get a reply after a week. In
    the last reply they suggested me to send the query to their legal team. I therefore
    sent an email to permissions@adobe.com but these did not send me back (more then
    2 weeks have passed). I therefore reopened the Customer Support Ticket I had and
    informed them about this. However I still did not received any reply back! More
    then a month has passed from when I started my query!\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nSim085"
