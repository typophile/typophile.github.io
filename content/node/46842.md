body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend similar typefaces to PTL Skopex Serif?\r\nhttp://typecuts.com/fonts.php?kid=1\r\n\r\nBasically,
  a modern serif with some interesting features, such as fancy ligatures, etc. Small
  caps, and both lining/non-lining numerals would be a bonus.\r\n\r\nThank you very
  much!\r\n\r\nMax"

    useful recommendations.

    very well into one font. Skopex\u2014you have to buy different fonts for those
    important typographic options we appreciate.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
