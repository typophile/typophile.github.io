body: "I am soon to start a branding job for a dental practice here in london - Logo,
  stationery, website and the like - and have been thinking about typefaces for such
  a job. I have a few in mind at the moment, a variety that exude what i feel is an
  appropriate level of quiet confidence, but am keen to know which typefaces any of
  you typophiles might think of when it comes to the dentist? At the moment, im most
  keen on Caecilia in its lighter weights, possibly even in small caps.\r\n\r\n"
