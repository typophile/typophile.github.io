body: "In this thread http://typophile.com/node/121385 OP put a scanned page from
  a 1961 book. Used types have somewhat twitched appearance. As I made earlier an
  OT feature which does that effect I modified a font (in that case Plantin) to recreate
  that look.\r\n\r\n1. FEA file:\r\n@class_alt1 contains UC and lc letters, space,
  comma, etc\r\n@class_alt2 contains as above, slightly displaced, names with .alt2\r\netc
  up to @class_alt10 ( .alt10)\r\n\r\n2. I made new glyphs - and copied the references
  of original glyphs and add the .alt1 to their names\r\n3. Again the same with .alt2
  names\r\netc up to .alt10\r\n\r\n4. I moved glyphs of every class slightly up or
  down \r\n<code>\r\nfeature calt { # contextual Alternates\r\nsub @class_alt1 @class_alt1'
  by @class_alt2;\r\nsub @class_alt2 @class_alt1' by @class_alt3;\r\nsub @class_alt3
  @class_alt1' by @class_alt4;\r\nsub @class_alt4 @class_alt1' by @class_alt5;\r\nsub
  @class_alt5 @class_alt1' by @class_alt6;\r\nsub @class_alt6 @class_alt1' by @class_alt7;\r\nsub
  @class_alt7 @class_alt1' by @class_alt8;\r\nsub @class_alt8 @class_alt1' by @class_alt9;\r\nsub
  @class_alt9 @class_alt1' by @class_alt10;\r\nsub @class_alt10 @class_alt1' by @class_alt1;\r\n}
  calt;<code\\>\r\n\r\nAs feature calt is applied, letters (and spaces, commas etc)
  are substituted and in effect their sequence is:\r\nx1, x2, x3, (etc), x10, x1,
  x2, x3 ...\r\nso every next letter belongs to the group moved in slightly different
  way.\r\nBecause font is slightly thinner (and more contrasty) than lead types used
  I added some black stroke and - to compensate inter letter space - some tracking.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/book_3673.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/idd_5284.jpg]\r\n\r\nAdvantage:
  -calt works almost everywhere\r\nDrawback:\r\n- in InD tracking about 40 switches
  off calt (why?!)\r\n- when you repeat lines the letters are moved in the same way
  (doesn't happen frequently in books)\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Adam Twardoch\r\n[[http://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/10641/#Comment_10641|1]]\r\n[[http://sites.twardoch.com/typography/font-tech/gpos-stylistic-sets|2]]"

  body: "InDesign turns off contextual features and ligatures for tracked text above
    a certain value, and in many, but unfortunately not all cases, this makes sense,
    since contextual substitutions are often used to avoid clashing letterforms or
    to effect better joins in script faces (though such faces probably shouldn't be
    tracked in the first place). However, InDesign's threshold is arbitrary and I've
    often felt it would be better if it were left to the designer to turn these features
    off.\r\n\r\nAndre"

  body: "Agree, Andr\xE9.\r\nStylistic Set can be used in that case - ssXX's are not
    turned off by tracking. But support is not that wide and in some environments
    only GSUB ssXX are allowed. See: https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_pt.htm#ssxx
    \"Each ssXX feature uses one-to-one (GSUB lookup type 1) substitutions.\"\r\nSo
    precise adjusting of glyph's widths will help.\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nI made an error
    in first post (and can't edit it)\r\n\r\n\"2. I made new glyphs - and copied the
    references of original glyphs and add the .alt1 to their names\"\r\nI did not
    change their names, the first class:\r\n<code>@class_alt1=[space exclam comma

    quite arbitrary: it is based on a percentage of the /space/ glyph width in a font,
    which means that the tracking unit at which ligatures and contextual alternates
    is turned off is proportional to the width of the font: lower for a condensed
    font and higher for an expanded font."
