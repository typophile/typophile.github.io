  seems I don't have (or can't find) that font anymore. So if anyone has an idea what
  font that is, please help ;)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sara_upload_3970.jpg]"

    common for tattoo artists to design their own alphabets that they use as models
    when tattooing? If so, that might explain why this doesn't look familiar (or,
    I just don't know this one).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: yes, usually I draw my own letterings, but I remember that customer wanting
    a font. It wouldn't be my style of drawing either, so I bet it is a font (it's
    three years ago, I don't really remember, but maybe it was a font that came with
    corel draw X3, I could have been using that at that time). Now he got another
    child and wants its name below ;)

    again myself if the letters are right ;)). By \"Bakeresque\" you mean a font called
    Baker, right?\r\n\r\nEdit: I searched for Baker fonts, and found Baker Signet\r\nhttp://www.searchfreefonts.com/font/baker-signet.htm\r\nand
    Baker script\r\nhttp://www.searchfreefonts.com/font/baker-script.htm\r\n\r\nbut
    those don't really fit..."

    from the House Las Vegas collection. I'm not sure any of these styles seems like
    the tattoo lettering. Chaplin (by some other name) might have been in Corel Draw.
    Lohner fonts, by virtue of their reasonable pricing, might have been packaged
    with other software; the House design certainly wouldn't have been. \r\n\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I think there is some license taken here by the artist. The cap S is a variation
    on Noris or one of the fonts he did for Hallmark and the l/c is pretty damn close
    to Colombine. The \"loops\" are the tat artist.\r\n\r\nMichael"
