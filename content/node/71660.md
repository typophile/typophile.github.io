  a small vintage clothing shop. Targeted largely to women, the client wanted a type-driven
  identity. The inventory is hand-picked vintage and sells to a trendy audience. After
  a bunch of cycles on numerous customized typefaces, we've centered at this direction.
  Some subtle things like the terminals, the 'e','r' and 'p' giving it a more character,
  I wanted a little old-style reference w/out being blatant, e.g. using a historical
  type.\r\n\r\nYou'll probably never guess what type I started with... :)\r\n\r\nWould
  love any/all thoughts, thanks!"

  body: I like it, but to me it doesn't really say vintage. Just judging by the type
    I would say it was a lingerie or luxury female clothing store. I don't know if
    this is a problem. I think the vintage idea could be reinforced by the materials
    and colours you use. Go for natural materials, I would say, and stay away from
    metal or glass. Just my 5 cents... :=)

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nto me, the type seems too wide for a clothing shop, wide type
    communicates oversize cloths, even though it\u2019s rather light. Putting it in
    one line reinforces this impression and makes it harder to read it as a whole,
    as a coherent entity. And right now, it seems a little bit too austere to me\r\n\r\nHere
    are my suggestions:\r\n\r\n- try putting it in two lines\r\n\r\n- if you don\u2019t
    want to make it more condensed, try to reduce the x-height (or rather enlarge
    the /S/\u2019s and the ascenders. Why not try a little more playful solution for
    the /S/\u2019s? Maybe even some swirls?\r\n\r\n- to me the (upper) terminal on
    /c/ and in particular on /r/ could use some more volume (when you change the /c/-terminal
    you would have to change the upper /S/-terminal as well)\r\n\r\n- the upper terminals
    on /S/ and /c/ could use a little \u2018curl\u2019 (see the left terminal of your
    /S/)\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "@Queneau\r\n\r\nFor sure, I'm wanting to letterpress business cards on a
    nice stock, probably not going as far as a cream or eggshell color, but 'craft'
    will definitely be a part of the look.\r\n\r\n@Joerg\r\n\r\nI don't know if the
    width for me connotes oversize clothes, extended type is extremely common in high-end
    fashion brands. Good feedback on the terminals, and that Flickr group is absolutely
    awesome, would love for this logo to feel like it could fit in with those old
    labels."

    on the width, condensed it and thickened a few of the terminals, this feels a
    lot better.."

  body: "Your /S/\u2019s seem to be leaning backwards.\r\nThis looks much better alltogether,
    the terminals are way better IMHO.\r\nYou might want to focus more on the \u2018vintage
    feel\u2019, though. I think an even lower x-height might help (for proportions
    see e.g. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bernhard-modern/ )\r\nDid you try
    to put /Shop/ beneath?\r\nCheers!\r\n"
