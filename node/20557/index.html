  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">One of the most successful and engaging type review lessons I conduct in the classroom is playing Type Jeopardy. I start off by teaching first year students the history of type, and following up with short activites. Although I adore history and everything about it, not every student shares my exuberance. Naturally, my slides are filled with colourful photographs and I tell interesting stories about how art and type is influenced by the time and place in which it is created. 

After the first class, subsequent classes begin with a review in the form of Type Jeopardy. I have categories to choose from (based on the previous class lesson). An early review week might consist of these categories: Movements and Eras; Terminology; Notable People; Type Styles; and Odds 'n' Sods. There is always a final question, as well.

So, as an example, under "Terminology", the questions might be:
100  The first letter or text is set as a larger or decorative letter used to introdue a section of type
200  Letters slanted to the right, distinct from Roman letters in their form, used for emphasis
300  Parts of lowercase letters that project above and below the boundaries of Capital letters
400  Connected letters or overlapped letters that scribes often made when handwriting, to save space
500  The Gothic lettering style was also referred to as this

Final Question: A publisher's emblem or inscription usually placed at the end of a book, giving facts about its publication is called what?

I break the class up into groups of 5 or 6 and they are allowed to collaborate. Each group has a group name and their scores are recorded on the blackboard, and added up in the end. One person from each group is given a bicycle horn to squeak when the group has an answer. Naturally, they have to state the answer in the form of a question. The winning group gets candy or dollar store prizes. It is truly amazing to see how hard they'll work for the prizes.

Do you have any successful and interesting teaching/learning methods? Please feel free to share them!</div>

Uhm we played hang man in english... you could do hang man with type terms.

Or charades with type terms. Any of those games that you have to act out or use other words for to describe the term. You could come up with a set of terms and also a set of terms they can't say to describe it, so if the term is "Capital" they can't say large or uppercase or big, etc.

		<div class="commentbody">Flash cards were always a good way to learn I think. So like personal jeapordy put a definition on one side and they gotta get the word. But you can do it with a partner so it goes quicker. 

Or you could have one word on one side that relates to the word on the other side and they gotta guess what the other word is. Simple would be Uppercase/lowercase, kern/letterspace, kern/leading, or kern/squooshed, etc. That way they gotta know all the possabilities to get the right one. (just don't make tests like this because then they might come looking for me :P)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Flash cards, eh? Interesting. I like the "get everyone involved in the classroom together" idea better but this is an interesting side step too. I can remember doing the flash card thing in elementary school, with math questions. Two lines of students and the teacher holding up the cards at the front. If you missed the answer, you went 'round to the back of the line you were standing in. The winner stayed on for as long as he/she could. That might work even better. Great help, Jesse - thanks!</div>

The intent is to provide opportunity to exchange ideas, successes and shortcomings of Type/Typography curriculums in graphic design schools. I  myself am hoping to launch a revised Typography I program this Fall (if the type gods allow) and hope to benefit from the exchange.

So keep those ideas flowing folks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was just called yesterday by Montserrat College of Art, located north of Boston. They asked if I was interested in taking over the Typography I course and that I would have latitude in revising the existing curriculum. (That is, if I pass muster with their Dean!)

Seems that previously, one of the intructors focused on technical aspects and the one before that on creative aspects of typography.

I happen to believe both are integral, as it always has been historically... advancements in printing, metalurgy, photography, computers directly effect the shape and use of type, while it is up to the creatives to harness that power.

Oddly enough, Montserrat is the school that invited Hrant to speak and staged his <a href="http://typophile.com/node/18990" target="new">A Line of Type</a> exhibit this past April.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Amy Conger (at CCSF) once gave me the great bit of advice that an ice-breaker during the first class session can make a big difference. My ploy involved the strong parallel between shoe design/making and type design, and I asked the students to come up to the board and write entries in two columns: their ideal shoe; and the type of shoe they actually typically wear. The point being to distinguish between display fonts and text fonts. Plus I stepped out of the classroom as they were doing this, so they would be more comfortable, being anonymous. It worked like a charm: the apprehensive expressions at the start of the class immediately turned into involved smirks. (On the other hand, if most of the students were men it might not have worked as well. :-)

Sadly, I recently declined the opportunity to teach at Montserrat since I literally just started a new full-time position as Sr. Producer (Interactive) at <a href="http://mullen.com" target="new">Mullen</a>.

But I will maintain contact with other design educators and still contribute to expanding the <a href="http://typophile.com/forum/16">Typographic Education</a> section here at Typophile.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Andi & co,
thanks for the inspiration.

I about to prepare typographic lessons for the next semester...
the course is only a few weeks so it very practical.

ofcause we talk about history and categories of type... and i give them the small exercice from stop stealing sheep - matching different shoes with typefaces. then they get some words like dad, love, industry, music and type them.
Then they do the exercise from Richard Wilde - my name is xxx and i have hick-ups etc.
Ater this they get an assignment to do an aidsposter only using type.
W also discuss trends and typographers... these are some of my favorites:
http://www.pmkfa.com
www.cover.com - a danish magazine which uses typography in a brilliant way
http://www.e-types.com

Please give me your input and inspiration...
Whats your experiences of great typographic asignments

have a great day
