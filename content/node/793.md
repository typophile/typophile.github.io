body: Hey guys, not been around here for quite a while, but things have been slow
  at work so I&#39;ve had some time to work on another font. This one has been kicking
  around for a while - I got the inspiration from a 60&#39;s jazz album cover. I wanted
  to do a worn out wood-type font - this one looks hand lettered on the reference
  I have and I liked the effect. Anyway it&#39;s in an early stage right now - just
  working out the character shapes in freehand, so just general comments wanted really
  on the work so far.

  body: Thanks for the thumbs up. Actually the &#39;R&#39; is one of the letters that
    I had a reference for! but i see what you mean - i&#39;ll give it a tweak.  <BR>The
    one that was really giving me problems was the &#39;M&#39; - I had &#39;Barnum&#39;

    by my desk to give me a hand but it didn&#39;t help much, I hope my solution fits
    in ok. <BR>The numerals should be cool - could have some fun with those. There
    won&#39;t be an uppercase but I may use the slots for alternate versions, I was
    thinking maybe broken or worn-out characters or improvised characters. Any other
    ideas? Does anyone know if/how wooden type typicaly gets broken or worn-out? any
    examples? <BR>BTW I hadn&#39;t done a seting in it yet thanks! Looks cool.

  body: '&#60;p&#62;Here&#39;s a few more characters. I gave the &#39;R&#39; a tickle
    - maybe needs more attention. Some of the other characters need a little work
    - are there any that look way out? <BR>When I&#39;ve got the basic forms right
    I&#39;ll do what you suggested and fine tune the widths and serifs. <BR>I checked

  body: Joe -- How far can you push this? What about the idea of bell-bottoms? And
    the quirkiness in the R, I wouldn&#39;t regularize it any further. I was thinking
    about this and maybe the quirkiness will be what makes it your own? The exclamation
    point doesn&#39;t seem right?

  body: The &#39;T&#39; seems short and a little thin. The &#39;S&#39; seems to be
    falling backwards. Overall, the characters all share a roundness, so those characters
    which you&#39;ve added optical correction to seem too much. Does that make sense?
