  bit \"too much,\" as if I'm reaching for effects.\r\n\r\nAny opinions on this?  Does
  anyone have experience using these?  Are there ways to tone them down?  Know of

  body: There are various techniques, such as small size, letterpress, coloured paper,
    or coloured ink. it's not really a question of toning the typeface down, but making
    the funkyness of the type part of the general funky effect, not something that
    might otherwise draw attention to itself.

  body: 'Thanks so much Nick.  Yes, I see what you mean.  The smaller size does indeed
    help - though doing so also creates other issues.  There is, however, a warmth
    & charm in these fonts that I do like very much.  I''ll keep working at it!  Cheers,
    :-) '

  body: 'Well, your poems have to be the main thing, not the typography, which should
    just serve them. I would just take any solid text face, graceful, easy to read,
    and quiet, and set your poem well in it. Then send it out without agonizing further.
    Then try another font. You''ll soon settle on what you like, for a while anyway.  '

  body: William, of course you're right.  I'm getting a little sidetracked - thanks
    for the nudge :-)

  body: These are certainly context typefaces. Depending on the context they can be
    exceedingly trendy, and thus boring, or they can be a tasteful nod to the past.
    If you set with them, make sure to use period typographic techniques like old
    style numerals, small caps, etc. (For some reason, they loved to use Italics a
    lot more in the past than we do. I dunno?)
