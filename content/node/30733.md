  body: "Hi, Aleksander. The first thing you should ask yourself is <em>why</em> you'd
    like it to be more funky and handmade-like. In other words, what purpose would
    that serve? What point would it make about the cleaning company? If you just want
    the logo to look trendy, it might look outdated in a few months, and a logo has
    to stand the test of time, among other things.\r\n\r\nWhen you say you know it
    should be clean, professional and \"white\", there is probably a reason for this,
    i.e., because these visual characteristics are known to transmit the idea of \"clean\".
    Perhaps you want this logo to stand out from the competition? Are their logos
    similar to this one?"

  body: "Hi Ricardo,\r\n\r\nI was thinking about handmade typeface to reflect the
    process of cleaning as \"hand made\" activity. That's why I created those two
    hands. I don't want the logo to look trendy. I'm far from that. I just wanted
    to put more energy in it and make both the sign and typeface looking consistent.\r\n\r\n_______\r\n
