body: "hello\r\n\r\nim not sure if Design is the right subforum, please move this
  thread if its in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nim finishing a font that i plan to release
  for free download (but with a good EULA, i asked in another thread about that part).
  i want to finish it for my portfolio (trying to get into a university), and right
  now im adding some special charaters. its a UC-only font.\r\n\r\nright now i have\r\n\r\n?\r\n!\r\n,\r\n.\r\n;\r\n$
  \xA3 \u20AC\r\nlong and short -\r\n\r\nim planning to add ( ) , @, +, the french
  characters (\xE7, \xB4, `, ^) and the german ones (\xE4 \xF6 \xFC).\r\n\r\ncould
  someone add the characters i'd need for italian and spanish? it is a free font after
  all, and i dont wanna work much more on this. so english/german/french/italian/spanish
  are the languages that i want to have in my font.\r\n\r\nis there anything i forgot?\r\n\r\n\r\nand:
  in german, there is the Sz (\xDF), but this is used in lc only. if i have an UC-font
  - would you add it? i mean its UC-only, so somehow there are reasons to add it,
  but also some against it.."

    texts. So you can simply make a glyph of two \xBBS\xAB, but you should not leave
    it blank.\r\n\r\nAbout the missing special characters:\r\nIt's always a good idea
    to design complete codepages. Take a look at:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Roman\r\n\r\nIf
    you use FontLab, it's very easy: Just select the codepage and fill all grey characters
    with your designs. So you will have support for all the languages mentioned on
    the Wiki pages above.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\n"

    don't want to do this, including the characters listed here http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ProductionGuidelines.mspx#office
    should ensure your font works in Microsoft Office. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks alot for your help. i added a nightshift yesterday, right now it looks
    like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/octroy_7_praes.gif]\r\n\r\nsurely
    its not perfect, but it was my first \"real\" font and im quite proud of it (i
    have a nice vector-illustration poster in a sovjet propaganda style that i can
    use with this). and note, there is NO kerning or spacing done. this is all in
    illu!"

    thread till i see that nobody answers here.\r\n\r\nas you see this is an UC-only
    font. now, my question is: i could make the light weight the lc-chars and the
    normal weight the uc-chars. i'd like that, but im not sure how others see this
    issue. any opinions?"

    numerals and punctuation. Just double map the glyphs u&lc or draw small caps and
    map these to the lc. \r\n\r\nSi"
