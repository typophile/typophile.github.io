  I'm a small business owner just starting out and I had a friend design a logo for
  us, it's using ITC Fenice. However we can't use ITC Fenice on our website or documents
  because we don't have a license. My friend was able to create the logo because he
  has a license and customised the font a little and gave us a PNG file. I'm looking
  for fonts that would go well with an ITC Fenice logo but these need to be free (I'm
  a poor student fresh out of Uni!) and I need to be legally able to use them on my
  website, on documents, bills, contracts and business cards. Any ideas or suggestions?\r\nThanks
  so much!\r\n\r\nEthan"
