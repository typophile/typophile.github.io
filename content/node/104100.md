  body: No, because the 'law' refers to the optical space between letters, not the
    space within letters. In a monospaced fonts, all the glyphs are on the same width,
    therefore a monospaced font is much less likely than a proportionally spaced font
    to conform to Dadich's dictum, because normally narrow and wide letters are procrusteanly
    fitted to a common width.

    themselves are of different sizes (generally differing in horizontal widths),
    but the entire optical space between the letters still remains proportionally
    equal, is that correct?\r\n"

    I apply them between letters? Do I allocate the spacing between the farthest inside

    for the trees here. I get that the sidebearings need to be tighter on the o's
    versus the n's. Let's say you have an outlined font in Illustrator, a single word:
    volume (see previous post image). Now I've captured the proportional area between
    the letters and I want to apply the \"pillars\". What is the procedure? Take for
    example the V and the O in VOLUME. Where do you draw the lines for allocating
    the pillar space?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is the serifs that are throwing me off... "

    based in logotype design. I like to customize outlined font glyph's in Illustrator
    and I always run into a wall with sidebearings and proper spacing.  I've read
    up on all the books and scoured the internet for answers, but all I seem to come
    up with is the need to \"train your eye\". I also tried turning fonts upside down
    and several other suggestions to no real avail. Sure, I get a result, but it is
    so subjective.\r\n\r\nThe Law of Optical Spacing seemed really promising because
    my interpretation was that there was a mathematical way to approach the issue.\r\n\r\nBert,
    your explanation makes perfect sense. \r\n\r\nWilliam, thanks again for your insights.
    I wish there was a more precise geometric method for achieving the desired result.
    \r\n\r\nIt seems  somewhat archaic to subjectively decide on what is visually
    equal. Glyphs have a certain ascender height, descender height, x-height, etc.
    Typically, these values are interlocked or repeated through a logotype or font
    depending on the letters. The one element of type design that seems the most \"artsy\"
    is the spacing and kerning, but perhaps that is what makes it human. It is still
    such a mystery..."

    has found it. Even ikern, which is the most automated thing I've heard of, has
    variables for the designer to set. \r\n\r\nBut when you think about it, you're
    designing the spaces as well as the interior of the glyphs and the curves and
    strokes. So it's not totally surprising that there's no formula. And if you think
    about a character like a c or v, the question of how much of the 'open' part to
    count in the between-letter space, and how much to count as part of the letter
    isn't clear, and may vary with the neighbor... \r\n\r\nThat being said, if you
    kern a whole font you will get very quick and sure at it by the time you finish!

    while I was trying to understand Kindersley's ideas, I did have an e-mail exchange
    with the computer guy who helped develop a kerning program based on Kindersley's
    ideas. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that it never worked automatically. In particular
    I remember that a problem they never cracked was applying a single formula to
    both round and straight letters, and getting results that met the demands of Kindersley's
    eye. So that decision had to be imposed by human intervention. And it is a key
    one, and as came up in a recent thread, also varies by optical size of the letters
    (the visual angles spanned by a letter). \r\n\r\nI still think the idea of 'optical
    centre' is a useful concept, but setting the overall advance width his theory
    never cracked successfully. \r\n\r\nHis effort is one of the more interesting
    ones, but ultimately like all the others not fully successful.  "

  body: "To quote myself (at least) \"remember, what we read are clumps of words,
    not pairs of letters.\" In fact, depending on whatever other letters lie next
    to a pair, the optimum value with that pair will change, when considered in context.
    If you do not have contextual kerning, you should probably limit your kerning
    to the worst situation -- the \"first, do no harm\" aspect of design & composition.
    \r\n\r\nIn my view, proper letterfit & kerning is what helps us take in word boundaries
    without paying attention to them. The more distinct these are, the tighter the
    word spacing can be, if one so chooses. Letterfit is one key factor in effective
    word spacing.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, the better the word boundaries, that is,
    ones that don't call attention to themselves by being too close or too loose,
    \ the more leading choices that will work.\r\n\r\nTry setting some type. For text,
    try esp. (approximately) a 10/13 and a 10/15 setting for a full page. If you can
    get both to look good, you're onto something."
