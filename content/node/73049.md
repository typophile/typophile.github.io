body: "A company selling customizable products has an interactive site where a customer
  would select the colors/designs and add custom text (with multiple fonts to choose
  from) to the product. Think something along the lines of what Converse has going
  on [[http://www.converse.com/#/products/shoes/converseone/builder/chuTayOxCan0901,,,,|here]]
  where they are offering customized text with the choices of Arial and Monotype Corsiva.
  \r\n\r\nThe question I have is, what kind of font licensing needs to be in place
  for a company to use fonts in this manner? I'm speaking more in the viewpoint of
  the company who is in the process of selecting fonts for this purpose. \r\n"

  body: I had a situation recently where Veer had a vendor wanting to license a set
    of fonts for online use. This was the kind of thing like a greeting card where
    customers choose fonts among other things from a list for their product. Nothing
    as complicated as customers getting to download copies. So Veer drew up a special
    Eula for them that was obviously way more than regular license fees. I think they
    based the price (which I approved) on the scale of the vendors operation.

  body: 'It''s good to hear that Veer was able to come up with a custom agreement.
    In my experience the vendors I work with have a standard per server license agreement
    and associated fees, which are available on request, although not usually posted
    on their site for public perusal. '

  body: "Thank you guys for all your responses, it has been very helpful. Does anyone
    know roughly how much server-based licensing fees might be? \r\n\r\nAlso, would
    it be risky to use free fonts like the ones found on FontSquirrel.com that have
    no licenses? (For example: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/license/Windsong) "

    cases you get what you pay for, so the risk is mostly around quality, rather than
    legal risk. '

  body: "For this case I would seriously consider a custom typeface. An uppercase
    only alphabet (for example) wouldn\u2019t be a huge investment and can be made
    to fit the style of your product as well as adress any technical needs you might
    have. + It\u2019ll be unique! "
