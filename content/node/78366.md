body: "Hello, i'm a russian blogger and developer. I want to make a review of fonts,
  targeted for software developers(using it in IDE, editors).\r\nDue my location,
  i can't get a good information about best fonts(including proprietary fonts) for
  my work. Yes, my friends use fonts like Arial, Courier New, Liberation. It's so
  scary.\r\nSo, i want to find more information in asking of you, of professionals
  in fonts chosing :)\r\nNow i'm scanning google in searching of better fonts(like
  monaco, incosolata etc), but all pages are old. Maybe, you can tell me something
  new about fonts for development?\r\nI found alot of proprietary font, but i can't
  try it in my IDE(Eclipse and emacs). But, if i have a some more information about
  what fonts need to try - i'll buy it.\r\n\r\nSo, can you advise me best monospace
  fonts(better if it targetted for software developers) you ever seen? No matter how
  much it costs.\r\n\r\nRequirements to this font are simple:\r\nIt must be monospaced.\r\nIt
  must have dotted of slashed zero(but if font really awesome, i can ignore it).\r\nIf
  must have a cyrillic glyphs(not really needs, but it'll be cool due my location).\r\n\r\nAlso,
  i know what font looks different in different OS, but i need fonts for any OS for
  my review, becouse i'll make a review of fonts on each system(windows, linux, mac
  os) and i'll choose different fonts for each system.\r\n\r\nSorry for my \"english\"

  body: "I will not embarrass myself by attempting to comment on its typographic merits,
    but I have personally found a monospaced font called \"TI Uni\" very pleasing
    to my eyes when staring at code for hours on end.\r\n\r\nIt was used for code
    snippets in Texas Instruments' graphing calculator manuals for a while (might
    still be) and they had it as a free download on their site. You can probably find
    it with a quick google search."
