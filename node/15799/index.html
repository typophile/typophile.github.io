<p>I have been a lurker on these forums for a while now. Its a great ressource for everybody involved in type. My name is David Pache, Im a multimedia designer in Switzerland. Its time I get my company, Dache, off the ground. I do identities, newmedia, illustrations and webdesign. After months and months of research (finding your own logo is one of the hardest things to do) I beleave I have found it.</p>
<p>I created the name that goes with my logo using the same shapes and dimensions. I would really like some crits and comments from you if you would be so kind. Id appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

David Pache</p>

Although Dyson has a nice logo, I was going for something more&hellip;mathematical. 
A leaf you say? Thats the first time I&rsquo;ve been told this, very interesting. My idea was rather based around the webdesign aspect of my company, .com&rsquo;s and so forth, thus the yellow dot.</p>

<p>The actual type seems a bit thin — the &lsquo;h&rsquo; seems a smidgen wide (lots of counterspace), and the shape of the &lsquo;a&rsquo; needs a cleaner join where the vertical stem meets the rightmost part of the bowl, imho.</p>
<p>Also, this is something to be aware of.</p>

<p>What can I say about the quark logo, mine was made first. September 2nd to be exact, a little over a week before quark relaunched their logo :/
As long as Im not seen as a copy cat, I dont have a problem. That said would be nice if the scotish art council would deal with it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The mark is probably doing what you want: it looks contemporary and kind of technology-ish, it&rsquo;s dynamic, it&rsquo;s familiar but not completely so, etc. However, if you want to really make an impact in people&rsquo;s minds, this isn&rsquo;t the mark for you. No one&rsquo;s going to say: &ldquo;Remember the guy with the grey and orange logo? The one that looks kind of like Quark&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Your mark reminds me of other things, rather than sparking something unique in my mind. However, having a site of content up for people to associate with your logo will help overcome that.</p>
<p>Again, the logo isn&rsquo;t necessarily wrong or bad (it fits some of your goals, is pretty well crafted, and has a consistent visual theme), but I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s giving you the mileage you deserve from a personal logo. It feels too &lsquo;already seen it&rsquo; to me. If you&rsquo;re going to take the time and effort to design a mark, and not just a nice logotype, then you should probably push it past this into something even more unique.</p>
<p>As for the type forms, I&rsquo;d like to see some larger examples of the characters. The &lsquo;e&rsquo; and the curve-to-straight transitions on the &rsquo;d' don&rsquo;t look smooth enough to me, but that may just be the anti-aliasing at that size. Also, I agree with bj&rsquo;s assessment. The type feels too thin next to the mark. Perhaps its stroke weight should match the outer rule, rather than the inner one.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I based the size of the graphic mostly on the yellow dot so that its size is the same as in my websites dot ch.
I guess I could use a font that a profesionnal typograph has created (I was thinking Frutiger) but I really like my shape, its a little tough to &ldquo;surrender&rdquo; it because some large company has something similar, after me. My logo has multiple meanings for me. I am thinking about using a circular shape instead though. Or rotate it some, but then it will look like a raindrop.
I&rsquo;ve thought about it, but I wonder what you guys think. Is Quark really all that known by people who arent in the visual department anyway?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">David, here are my comments&hellip; I think the icon is appealing, but people will inevitably ask &ldquo;what does it mean&rdquo;. This is a problem, because logos shouldn&rsquo;t explain, but identify. With generic shapes like this the more likely it is to remind someone of something they&rsquo;ve seen before. The icon will have different meanings to different people, and some may have a negative reaction to it, sperm, egg, etc. Personally I don&rsquo;t think it is strong enough or distinctive enough to stand alone and your application of it, and use of type, will make all the difference. This is a piece of your overall identity, and once you have some of the other &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; in place you&rsquo;ll be better able to judge whether this is working or not. Best of luck, it is always hardest to do your own identity. Mine has been &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo; for 5 years!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thankyou gentlemen, all of you. I needed this, honnest crits with no holding back is what helped me from almost make a rather large mistake. I&rsquo;ve found a new source of motivation for this logo and it can only be better the second time round. Excuse me if I came off a little stubborn. Anyways, the only thing I am keeping is the colors, which I feel transmet my style if you will in its best way. Now its onto finding the perfect typographic solution for my name (Im thinking about Frutiger, good choice?), and once that is done, a new logo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going back to the drawing board and its thanks to you guys.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have to say the squircle element has been beat up to no end. I should know. I&rsquo;ve been using it for the last three years and then quark and bunch others decided to use the shape. Now I&rsquo;m stuck in a place where I can&rsquo;t just change my whole identity because of it. Now I hate it. Lovely. Oh well, such is life. I would definitely hit that drawing board and realy push out something innovative for your personal logo. Good Luck!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thankyou both. Im also trying to find something swiss without going to the clichés because it is something that does work relatively well, the new problem is finding a swiss graphic that appeals to both people here and in other countries.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I really like your new design&hellip; I&rsquo;m a sucker for the Swiss look. Naturally, I&rsquo;d say Helvetica (but I know I&rsquo;m going to take flack for that) it would just sit so nicely; the graphic mark is interesting, so I&rsquo;d look for a typeface that doesn&rsquo;t compete for attention with it - hence I&rsquo;m not too keen on the custom typeface. I know you might think that Helvetica would be a cliché&hellip; but I think it&rsquo;s made for your project.</p>
<p>I think that the type and the logo need to balance up more; the logo is solid and compact, I think a typeface that reflects that characteristic would work really well, if you decide against Helvetica. I&rsquo;m unsure about Frutiger because the logo is very geometric, to me the curves of the Frutiger typeface stand out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my 2 pence!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>They look good&hellip; I think the middle 2 (Helvetica &amp; Franklin Gothic) are my favourites.

<p>Really like the graphic, by the way.</p>
