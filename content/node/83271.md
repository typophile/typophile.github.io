body: This one was on the cover of a shop manual. It was used often in magazine adverts.
  The calligraphic consistency is very cleanly broken into individual characters,
  and the "J" style throws me every time I have seen it since 1963. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontjaguar_3830.gif]

    I would presume that it was done exclusively for Jaguar, and was never digitized.\r\n\r\n-

  body: 'It seems more like Ribbon 131 Bold which is relatively new and like one of
    the Coronet variations which are too numerous to list. It certainly was hand set
    in this example, but I have seen it in other places which suggest it was hot set
    also. '

  body: "Coronet itself was designed in 1937 by R. H. Middleton. Ribbon 131 is just
    the Bitstream name for their digitization of the metal type design.\r\n\r\nYou're
    right that it is pretty close to the Jaguar lettering, and maybe Coronet was the
    starting point used by whoever designed the Jaguar logo back then. The J and r
    are quite different, but the a, g, and u could almost be from Coronet.\r\n\r\n-
