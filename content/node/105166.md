  body: "What I like about this is that through this work it has become rather easy
    to see how all these accents work in \u2018real life\u2019. On the other hand,
    I also found some things that are somewhat questionable (in my opinion, being
    Dutch).\r\n\r\n<strong>Dutch language</strong>\r\n<em>j\xE8</em>\r\nI am afraid
    that I\u2019ve never seen that word. Google tells me that it may occur in \u2018j\xE8
    t\u2019aime\u2019, but that is a typo of \u2018je t\u2019aime\u2019. Which may
    occur in Dutch texts, but \u2018je t\u2019aime\u2019 is not Dutch, it is French
    for saying \u2018I love you\u2019.\r\n\r\n<em>chamb\xE9ryzomer</em>\r\nThat seems
    to be a typo. Could be Chambery zomer (\u2018Chamb\xE9ry summer\u2019, could be
    an offering of a travelling agent, alternatively to \u2018Chamb\xE9ry spring\u2019.
    But that does not turn Chamb\xE9ry into a Dutch word. Chamb\xE9ry is a place in
    France.\r\n\r\n<em>e\xE9nvandaag</em> \r\nSimilar to chamb\xE9ryzomer. Could be
    \u2018\xE9\xE9n vandaag\u2019 (one for today). But that does not make it a sample
    for the occurrence of e\xE9n in Dutch. I have seen \xE9en in Dutch but never e\xE9n.\r\n\r\n<em>matth\xE4us</em>
    \r\nAs far as I know, Matth\xE4us is not an official Dutch word, it is the German
    way of writing Mattheus (the evangelist). Shure one can find \u2018Matth\xE4us\u2019
    in a Dutch text, but that alone does not make it a Dutch word. \r\n\r\n<em>k\xF6ppen</em>
    \r\nMy Dutch dictionary does not list that word and I would not know what \u2018k\xF6ppen\u2019
    might mean. K\xF6ppen might occur in Dutch text as the name of the German author
    who wrote several books on color models. But in such a case K\xF6ppen is written
    with a capital K.\r\n\r\n<em>lu\xEFci\xFCs</em>\r\nGoogle tells me that this is
    probably derived from the family name \u2018van Stipriaan Lu\xEFci\xFCs\u2019.
    I only found 9 entries with that name, they refer to two people, a father and
    his son who lived around 1900. How Dutch is that? Or more serious: Is that really
    relevant to the Dutch language?\r\n\r\n<em>s\xE9bastien</em>\r\nNot a Dutch word,
    but a French name: \u2018S\xE9bastien\u2019. The Dutch would write \u2018Sebastiaan\u2019.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I could not find mistakes like this in the German section, so maybe the quality
    of the Dutch section is just an exception. Still I hope that Ondrej will find
    some time to check and correct it. "

    capitalized version of <em>\xE9\xE9n</em> ('only one', emphatically) is <em>E\xE9n</em>
    -- note the missing acute on the capital. Maybe Ondrej examined case-folded data,
    as evidenced by your other examples.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, very good work and a
    welcome reference!"

    is E\xE9n</blockquote>\r\nThis is a bit of a different matter but I need some
    verification. What do you think of \xC9\xE9n? In lowercase it's supposed to be
    \xE9\xE9n and yet with a capital letter I mostly see E\xE9n. I always assumed
    that's a mistake considering it's a bit less obvious for some how to add an accent
    to the capital letter, and as far as I can reason now this and '\xFCberhaubt'
    are the only cases in the Dutch language where a capital letter might get a diacritic
    \u2014 unless the whole word is capitalized of course.\r\n\r\nI think E\xE9n looks
    better, but it's logically inconsistent."
