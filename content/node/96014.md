body: "Well, today I registered the domain name iLUVfonts.com, and decided to celebrate
  by opening up my entire catalog to anyone who thinks that they can improve any of
  my fonts, for an equal share in the revenue. I am going to be less active in font
  development, and a lot more active in marketing and promotion.\r\n\r\nI am especially
  interested in non-Latin scripts. Rather than taking the one-big-ball-of-wax approach
  (many bytes and much moola), I think that the buying public would be well served
  with Latin+Greek or Latin+Cyrillic, at a very nice price (ten bucks a pop, or so).
  Some of my fonts are probably a little too wacky for Arabic, but maybe there are
  a lot of wacky Arabs out there I don't know about.\r\n\r\nAlso open for consideration:
  contextual alternates and ligatures to jazz things up. Also available: over 160
  works in progress, all in various stages of completion.\r\n\r\nAnd, if there are
  any Illustrator gurus out there, I would be happy to pay for a license for LivePresets,
  if you think that you can fix my \"no-stroke\" spacer problem in my AI Border Brush
  sets.\r\n\r\nRevenue splits will happen with each sale as it is posted and cleared:
  PayPal account required. See my complete commercial collection at myfonts.com, then
  let's talk: kipnick [at] msn [dot] com."

    reasonable.\r\n\r\nAnd, no: the revenue would be split automatically as each sale
    is made. Just make sure that you don't opt for the \"send me an email every time\"
    notification: too much good news tends to clog your inbox. Plus, a PayPal debit
    card gives you instant access to your money, anytime you want.\r\n\r\nIs there
    a large market for wacky Armenian fonts? Surely you aren't a typical Armenian\u2026are
    you?"

    charge a different price than your original? I'm thinking higher.\r\n\r\nI assume
    you get paid first and then hand out the 50%. Would the derivative designer at
    least get third-party notice of sales made?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I know of) but I wouldn't call myself \"wacky\" either. However with such a large

    then, nobody\u2014and, especially, nobody on the Illustrator development team\u2014has
    offered a solution. I simply want to delete the spacer lines from the swatch elements
    but retain the Postscript coordinates. How hard can that be? Judging from the
    thuderous non-response, apparently it's impossible. Go figure\u2026"

    and flog the hell out of the goods."

    you've been in dire straights lately, I worry that at some point, somehow I'll
    end up being sued (especially since your brother is a lawyer). Even if it's a
    frivolous lawsuit I stand to lose something, not least time, which is my most
    valuable resource.\r\n\r\nAnd if any third party wants to give me advice, general

  body: "Nick, yep I now understand... insert evil laugh here \"_ _ _\".\r\n\r\nI'll
    look around and try to find a work around to your, stroke-no-stroke, problem.
    Stroking a no-stroke would obviously defeat the no-stroke spacer alignment method.
    I think that is where the problem began, that is, 'fixing' the pattern's alignment
    via using 'no-stroke' spacers.\r\n\r\nWhy couldn't the patterns work seamlessly
    without using no-stroke spacers?\r\n\r\nn.\r\n  "

    WHICH CASE the no-stroke spacers would become visible. Capisce?"

    will maintain a digital certificate, so that all Opentype fonts released through
    the site can be digitally signed.\r\n\r\nPlus, if some of the geniuses in the
    BUILD forum can guide me, I am proposing that every font sold will also include
    a unique serial number appended to the XUID number.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would
    like to offer Forever Font Insurance to all purchasers. If they register their
    purchases, any and all future upgrades to the specific fonts which they licensed
    will be upgraded at no additional charge. What say? Would a guarantee like that
    be worth an extra buck or two at checkout?"
