  body: could be a heavily edited <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alternate-gothic-lt/"
    target="_blank">alternate gothic</a>, dont think the original typeface was so
    blurry and if you look at the two i and n, you clearly see different "mistakes"
    in the lettershape.

  body: "they dont match exactly, also i only had \xABAlternate Gothic No 2 BT\xBB
    to use here at work, but if you look at the irregularities.. it seems like the
    copied and then slightly changed the \"grungy\" parts again - the i-dots are similar
    but exactly the same.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/invasion1_4163.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/invasion2_5979.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/invasion3_4543.gif]\r\n\r\nbut

  body: "Patricia is right, the dots and the bumps on the stem of the i are identical.
    This is probably a freeware font.\r\n\r\nI guess you could consider FF Kipp a
    lookalike."

  body: If you happen to have a license for Alternate Gothic, just use that (don't
    forget to rotate the s ;^) and grunge it up using my <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/how_to_create_a.cfm#21">FontFeed
    tutorial</a>.

  body: "i still think the designer grunged it  manually, the dots are similar, but
    as said, not identical.  the bumps on the i-stems are identical , but that could
    be because he just copied the one that looked better after the \"grunging\". (all
    those newly created words.. ouch)\r\n\r\nbut oh well, maybe someone else knows
    the exact font."
