  body: "This is likely to be tough to find, because hand-printed fonts are so easy
    to make. If it's not a commercial font, or a widely used amateur freebie, you
    are probably out of luck.  [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html|Part
    11]] of my Script Font ID Guide (Everyday Hand Printing) would be my best shot
    at showing it, if I have collected it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    that before. nice work!\r\n\r\nI suspect this is another free download of questionable
    (and possibly untraceable) lineage. thanks for trying."
