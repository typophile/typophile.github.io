  body: 'Interesting. &#40;Not something I&#39;d want to look at if I had a hangover!&#41;
    <BR> <BR>A couple of quick thoughts: The x and z need to be wider, and I think
    you might have better success with hanging numerals &#40;plus they would match
    the lowercase alphabet better&#41;. For the 4, try matching the upper curve on
    the o &#40;p,q,g&#41;. The arches also need to be refined, but I&#39;m not entirely
    sure what to recommend. Play around a bit.'

  body: I think with a large does of discipline and some OpenType programming &#40;which
    the &#34;s&#34; for example is crying out for&#41; this could come out quite nice.
    And the numerals, yes, hanging for sure. <BR> <BR>hhp

    really like it -- but I would close the window <BR>so that the draft would not
    make it sick. <BR>Best, <BR>AS

  body: I also like it, this is very original and hip but still needs work, stem weight
    is irregular, some shapes &#40;like w and m&#41; are just reflected glyphs. w,
    x, y and z are not well proportioned.

    put in, university keeps getting in the way.  <BR> <BR>Opentype is definatly planned-
    with alternates and whatnot. <BR> <BR>Alessandro; I&#39;m not quite sure what
    you mean by &#39;close the window.&#39; <BR> <BR>Thanks!
