  body: "Yes, it looks Neil Bold, not sure if it is digitized.\r\nThere is a really
    close one (actually based on Neil Bold) called\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts-mobley.htm\">Mobley</a>
    from Sudtipos, you can see the difference for example in the \"E\", and I think
    that Mobley is a little more \"condensed\"."

    bit different. Here's the original:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NeilBoldPDH01_5336.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NeilBoldPDH02_3750.gif]"

    answer and once I saw it, I just changed the beginning instead of \"It looks Neil...\".\r\nCall
    me lazy."

  body: "hmmmm. Mobley is the closest that I know of. I'm not sure if there are any
    outstanding copyright issues. I'll have to do some research. What are you wanting
    to use this for?\r\naha! apparently there IS a digital version out there:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/9314"

  body: "Splendid!\r\n\r\nThanks again Paul. I checked on the Castcraft Software site,
    but could not find the font in one of their four designer collections, but they
    might have more fonts than the ones displayed on their site. The site seames a
    little outdated. I'll try an email (even though Mike Yanega implied in the previous
    post that their customer service is a little outdated as well).\r\n\r\nOystein"
