  one of these. I attempted to recreate it in Illustrator, but it didn't quite turn
  out so well. I need to change the colors and words used. Is there an easy way to
  replicate this look? Any suggestions will be helpful at this point. "

    apply it to segments of a circle. I suspect the bevel can be simply  made from
    the 3d option in Illustrator. I can\u2019t give you detailed information because
    I can\u2019t access Illustrator at the moment.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: I don't believe it's possible to do that in any of those programs.  Fireworks
    is the most capable of the bunch, and unless they just added the feature, it doesn't
    let you do type around a curve like that. Just doing the circles and arrows would
    be a lot of work, although you could probably stack a bunch of circles of different
    sizes, using some the same color as the background to make it appear that there
    are curved lines, and then draw in the arrowheads manually. It's easy in Adobe
    Illustrator, but none of the programs you have are made to do things like that.

    you can produce a thing with arrows in a circle and text boxes <em>between</em>
    the arrows, which is quite quick and easy, but not text curving round within the
    arrows. (Nor fancy bevel effects, obviously!)\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver

    Marketing Charts and Diagrams. If you just click on the shape to add text, Visio
    puts the text in the middle of the circle. To put text on each individual arrow,
    you have to ungroup the shape; the text then sorta-kinda curves inside the arrow.\r\n"

    as you need arrows.\r\n3) Set the appropriate stroke size \r\n4) On each path
    section, use the \"Filter-> Stylize-> Add Arrowheads\" to add your arrow shapes\r\n5)
    Optional: Use \"Expand Appearance\" to turn each section into it's own object.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps."
