body: "The whole object of this exercise is for me to encounter and overcome problems.
  As it is Christmas-time, and we are living in a credit crunch, I can't dash out
  and buy all the typographical technical guides that I would like - but I think that's
  a good thing. I've always been better at getting stuck in and getting my hands dirty
  with stuff...\r\n\r\nDropping a few more letters in has galvanised a couple of thoughts
  that I have. I love Gotham Rounded - http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100030
  - and I've frequently thought (as mentioned before) that I might round some of this
  font off. I really think it could be quite an interesting typeface if select parts
  were squared and others rounded. That thought has really been cemented in my mind
  now, having had a pop at the 'r' (which I like) and the 'f' (which I don't like
  at all). This typeface 'squared' also looks like a lot of other ones... and I'd
  like something distinctive, so the next update I hope may be a departure!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/additionalLetters_5358.jpg]"
