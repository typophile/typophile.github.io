  space of a font in FontForge. I only need to do this for a few fonts for a gaming
  project being developed in Unity (3D). If anyone has a good link or short answer,
  it would be very appreciated. Not looking to become a font editor, just need to
  accomplish this one task.\r\n\r\nI have done searches, so please don't think I haven't
  tried...finding a clear answer has been quite the challenge. The fonts in question
  are TrueType and nothing on the exotic or wild side of life. Unity just doesn't
  handle fonts as well as it does 3D development, so I need to edit the font line
  spacing within the font as a tool for doing so in Unity doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
