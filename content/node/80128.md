  for the Congo.The client wants to use the attached font (ignore the kerning...they
  sent it to me that way) as our primary display face. I like the fact that it doesn't
  look too slick, but it just feels too amateurish and off to me. And that \"R\"!\r\n\r\nCan
  you possibly suggest alternates? Something that has a primal, tribal, handmade feel,
  is somewhat bold, conveys a bit of urgency? Nothing clich\xE9, of course.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas would be most appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks, folks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/berta-drug-font_3588.jpeg]"

  body: A friend of mine brought home a shop sign from Ghana which display those kind
    of letters you are talking about. I think primal and tribal are bad words, as
    they don't convey the concept. David Quay's Kade is inspired by hand lettering
    on boats, and might very well fit your bill.

    typefaces seem to be the last places in the world you're still allowed to spew

    think using traditional art motifs from Africa could work in a typeface, but in
    general it's horrendously heavy-handed, full of ideas that Africa is particularly
    rough, primitive, tribal, dark...\r\n\r\nAfrican design, espeically these days,
    is probably just as hypermodernist as anything in Europe. I'm not familiar enough
    with contemporary congolose stuff to really bring that up, but if I had to pick
    one font to represent (say) Nigeria it'd probably be Helvetica Extra Bold Compressed,
    probably (unfortunately) with some sort of metallic effect.\r\n\r\nHere's a blog

    know what it looks like, and neither does the audience, but I can almost assure
    you looks about like it does in your example, and as it does in much design from
    Bakersfield to Barneveld and beyond, meaningless sans, rudely composed.\r\n\r\nNow
