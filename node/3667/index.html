<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>My agency is developing a visual identity for a swedish university college of film, radio, television and theatre. <br> <br>Right now different designers are exploring different solutions, my idea is basically to design a typeface with a set of special ligatures and icons, as the schools identity. <br> <br>Initial inspiration has come from Meta Designs work for Glasgow and Matthew Carters for Walker Art Institute. <br> <br>But I thought, <i>maybe ze Typophiles can assist me as well</i>? <br> <br>So, what I'm asking for is icon suggestions. <br> <br>The obvious ones should represent Radio, Film, TV and, er, Theatre. <br>I can see two ways to deal with this; either with the archetypic, generic symbols (the theatre one with the happy and sad mask) or a more original, yet <i>highly stylized</i> approach. I think both are fine, but they should all be on the same abstraction level. <br> <br>Next to those symbols, it's an open question; what else could I need? More to the point, what do <i>they</i> need? Obviously I'll ask them as well, but still. I think you're all capable to contribute. <br> <br>They're moving to a new building (It has been built exclusively for them), so a Building-icon is on its way, signage signs such as arrows could be handy, maybe toilet signs as well. OK, the list could go on, but I would really appreciate some input. <br> <br>The stage is yours. <br> <br>Yours, <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think you should consider having one "umbrella" symbol to tie everything together, and use a secondary symbol -or maybe acronyms- to differetiate everything. Consider making the umbrella symbol a set of three or four concentric arcs of a circle (you know, like on a volume button), meaning something like "to broadcast". <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, <br>Your suggestion has a different hierarchy than the one I had in mind and, I believe, is another idea altogether. <br> <br>If I had had the time I could have explored it further, but next week is a killer. <br>Thanks anyway. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>The Fachhochschule Wiesbaden in Germany has a logo for each department, as well as an umbrella logo for the college. Their CI is Meta, I think. <br> <br>I'm almost certain that Werner Schneider had a hand in their design. In any event, he taught their forever before retiring a few years ago. His Vialog from Linotype also has a symbol set, designed with f&uuml;nfwerken. But that doesn't have anything to do with the school (although it is in the same style). Vialog, and some of its symbols were designed for the Munich Transportation Authority, which now has a kick-&#149;&#149;&#149; navigation/identity system as well. <br> <br>Linotype Vialog <br><a href=http://www.linotype.com/43576/vialogltsigns-family.html target=_blank>http://www.linotype.com/43576/vialogltsigns-family.html</a> <br> <br>F&uuml;nfwerken <br><a href=http://www.fuenfwerken.de/ target=_blank>http://www.fuenfwerken.de/</a> <br> <br>FH Wiesbaden (unfortunately, the school website does not have a clear description of its identity system on its website, that I know of) <br><a href=http://www.fh-wiesbaden.de target=_blank>http://www.fh-wiesbaden.de</a> <br> <br>Munich Transportation Authority <br><a href=http://www.mvg-mobil.de/ target=_blank>http://www.mvg-mobil.de/</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Dan, some good stuff there. <br> <br>Btw, did you notice one of Vialogs icons symbolized a bungee jumper? <br> <br></div>
