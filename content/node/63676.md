  body: "I don't know if they still let people in there, but I visited, some seven
    years ago, the Ensched\xE9 Museum in Haarlem; just a short ride from Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nI
    had a chance to hold the original punches of Henri Didot  from 1827. The size
    was Non Plus Ultra, which is roughly 2 or 3 points. And I got to hold the \"Evangile
    selon St. Matthieu\", a book the size of a matchbox, set with that very type.
    And you could actually read the text! And there is loads and loads more stuff
    there.\r\n\r\nWhen I went there, I found an e-mail of the curator and set the
    date and time. No photography allowed, since the printworks where the museum is
    in the basement of still prints money.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."
