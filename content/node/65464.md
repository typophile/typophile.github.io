  body: "Hold on, are we sure that the symbol used in modal logic is supposed to be
    the lozenge?\r\n\r\nI thought not, but on investigation, the situation seems a
    bit murkier. Wikipedia's page on the lozenge seems to think so, for instance.\r\n\r\nIn
    modal logic, the modality 'possibility' is represented by the diamond shape, while
    'necessity' is represented by the box shape. Typographic preference would be for
    both symbols to be square-like, and you can see this from the above example. So
    the traditionally narrow lozenge would not be the best fit for this symbol.\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    in LaTeX, \\Diamond and \\Box are usually used for these symbols. \\Diamond comes
    from the LaTeX symbol font and is a square diamond. The best match in Unicode
    might be \u25C7 'White Diamond' U+25C7. The \\lozenge is separate in LaTeX, available
    from the AMS symbols package.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that modal logicians have been
    using the square diamond symbol without ever meaning it to be a 'lozenge', but
    their similarity has led to some confusion, or at least some imperfect solutions
    where lozenges are substituted when a proper square diamond symbol is missing.
    I think Wikipedia is wrong here; I see no reason at all to call the 'possibility'
    symbol a lozenge. It's not that lozenges are traditionally narrow but modal logicians
    like them square, but rather that modal logicians use a square diamond symbol
    that is somewhat similar in appearance but is a different character from the lozenge.\r\n\r\nSeparately,
    in axiomatic logic, there is something called diamondsuit that is represented
    by \u2662, the 'White Diamond Suit' U+2662, as in the card symbol. There's also
    the clubsuit, represented by \u2663."

    being the relative obscurity and unrelatedness of the two topics even if they
    both fall under the broad heading of mathematical logic.\r\n\r\nIn any case, for
    such specialized usage, something like TeX would most likely be used, where the
    symbols would be entered as \\diamondsuit in one case and \\Diamond in the other.
    Then TeX would call up the right symbol font to supply these symbols. So unless
    you intend to make a symbols font usable in TeX, you don't have to worry about

    not meant to be width compatible with anything but a lozenge, which by definition

  body: "<cite>I don\u2019t know what you mean by traditional lozenge shape?</cite>\r\n\r\nGood
    point. I wasn't clear about this, and didn't think it clearly through in my head
    either when I wrote that.\r\n\r\n'Traditional' probably wasn't the best word.
    What I meant was the shape we conventionally think of when we think of lozenges,
    and I don't confine myself to typographic lozenges here (although a quick check
    through the fonts on my computer show a range of about 50 to 80 degrees, with
    around 60 degrees being the typical angle). Do an image search of 'lozenge' and
    see what kinds of shapes turn up. Something between 60 and even 90 degrees is
    typical.\r\n\r\nIf we make a lozenge 3/4 of the cap height <em>and</em> make it
    45 degrees, it will be quite small. Below, Georgia's original lozenge is shown
    on the left and a 45-degree 3/4-of-cap-height lozenge that I quickly threw together
    is shown on the right, so you can appreciate the difference. Sure, I could have
    employed some tricks to make the new lozenge appear larger, and Georgia's wide
    design arguably calls for a wider lozenge than usual, but I think this will do
    to illustrate my point.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Georgialozenges_6228.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    don't think of the lozenge as a mathematical symbol, by the way. As I said before,
    I am of the opinion that the diamond-shaped mathematical symbols used in some
    specialized branches of mathematical logic are not typographical lozenges, but
    either a diamond that looks like a square rhombus or a diamond suit. Ideally,
    these should get appropriate typographical treatment (using special sorts for
    instance) and not be lazily substituted with typographical lozenges you find in
    most fonts.\r\n\r\nThe typographical lozenge, as I take it, is a sort of generic
    symbol without such rigid expectations on its shape, like bullets. So the Microsoft
    Character Design Standards are a rough guideline only, and the designs where the
    lozenges reach cap height are not breaking some inviolable rule. Its width is
    not completely independent of the design, as I mentioned in connection with the
    Georgia sample above. Note that the Microsoft Character Design Standards also
    state that the advance width of the lozenge should be proportional to the design."

  body: "<cite>I assume the 1st loz isnotaloz, and you know the 2nd loz is small cap
    ht?</cite>\r\n\r\nThe first lozenge in the sample is indeed the lozenge included
    in the font Georgia, if that's what you're wondering. Or were you questioning
    whether Georgia's lozenge was a true lozenge or not? Before this thread, I wouldn't
    even have thought to question that...\r\n\r\nThe second lozenge has exactly the
    same height as the original Georgia lozenge; it was mechanically modified from
    the original glyph only in the horizontal dimension to make it narrower while
    maintaining the same outline width. I have marked the sample below to show that
    this height is indeed around 3/4 of the cap height. Georgia has a large x height
    compared to the cap height, so this does turn out to be close to the small cap
    height. Maybe I should have chosen a different font, but I only picked the one
    serif font I assumed everyone was familiar with, being the font used for Typophile
    and all.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Georgialozengesmarked_4109.gif]\r\n\r\nNow,
    on the 45-degree business, it seems that at least one technical definition of
    the lozenge is that of 'an equilateral parallelogram whose acute angles are 45
    degrees'. The definition comes from [[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Lozenge.html|MathWorld]].
    It is immediately followed by the statement, 'Sometimes, the restriction to 45
    degrees is dropped, and it is required only that two opposite angles are acute
    and the other two obtuse'.\r\n\r\nI did not know about this 45-degree requirement
    before. And to repeat what I said before, I think in popular usage no such requirement
    is in force, so that a range of 50-80 degrees is typical. Perhaps whoever put
    in the 45-degree requirement for the typographical lozenge on Wikipedia had the
    stricter technical definition in mind, assuming (wrongly, I think) that this also
    applied to typographical tradition."
