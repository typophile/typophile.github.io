body: Just curious, but what are everyone&#39;s impressions of  <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/whitney/"
  target="_blank">Whitney</a> by Hoefler and company? I&#39;ve been eyeing the face
  since they recently announced availability, and from what I can tell it seems like
  a very clean, versatile face that could offer a refreshing &#40;though not entirely
  different&#41; break from Meta, Fago, Avenir, and other similar faces. But is it
  distinctive enough? I&#39;m considering getting the basic / small caps families
  and was curious what others thought.

  body: Wow, I didn&#39;t know the Whitney Sans had been released. Where was I when
    this was announced?  <BR> <BR>I first noticed Whitney when Matthew Carter selected
    it for his Critic&#39;s Award in the first <i>Critique</i> competition back in
    1998. I was under the impression that it was created for the Whitney under the
    auspices of the Font Bureau, so I&#39;m a little curious that Tobias is now able
    to release it through H&amp;F-J. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: Whitney Sans? <BR>Yeah, I went to to the website to check it out. <BR>Apparently
    it&#39;s named after a museum, not a naked diva. <BR>Type geeks -- gotta love
    &#39;em. <BR>
