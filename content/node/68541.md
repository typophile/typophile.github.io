body: "[Vlad has already mentioned this in numerous existing threads on webfonts,
  but I think it is an important development and one that deserves its more general
  attention, especially from those who may wish to contribute to or monitor the webfont
  standardisation effort.]\r\n\r\nToday the World Wide Web Consortium announced the
  creation of a webfonts working group, following their usual lengthy approval process.
  Details of this working group, including the approved charter, were posted to the
  W3C font discussion list today by Chris Lilley:\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2010JanMar/0044.html\r\n\r\nAs
  my dog would say: Woff! Woff!"

  body: I think the type could use some sub-pixel positioning, to move the first F
    left a sub-pixel.

    that dog \u2013 when rendered so big, in 72 points \u2013 is displayed with grayscale
    anti-aliasing, and its woff in supbixels. This must be a clever pun to show how
    different are rasterizers."
