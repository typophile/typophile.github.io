body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've just read about James Joyce's Copenhagen Cats apparently
  being 'illegally published' in the UK. It's format is DOUBLE ELEPHANT SEXTOS. Amazing!
  \r\n\r\nCan anyone think of other whacky vintage (or otherwise) typotalk? \r\n\r\nNut,
  mutton, etc don't seem to live up to DOUBLE ELEPHANT SEXTOS!"

  body: "<em>Sexto</em> here is short for Decimo-sexto, also abbreviated 16\xBA or
    16mo (and sometimes called \u201Csixteenmo\u201D). \r\n\r\nSo this \u201Cillegal\u201D
    publication of <cite>Copenhagen Cats</cite> was printed on double elephant\u2013size
    paper (about 26.75 \xD7 40 inches) and folded in sixteenths (which makes 32 pages
    per signature).\r\n\r\nSo the trim size on this edition was around 6.6875 \xD7
    10 inches. "
