  in may 1948 that neither I or my father can translate. If anyone here can read S\xFCtterlin
  or knows anyone who does, please let me know, I can provide scans of the letter
  (2 pages long). Thank you."

    if the handwriting isn't too ideosyncratic, and wouldn't mind providing a quick
    transcript."
