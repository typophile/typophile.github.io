body: "I came across some type samples of two (possibly unrelated) typefaces used
  in <a href=\"http://blog.modernmechanix.com/publication/?pubname=MechanicsAndHandicraft\">Mechanics
  and Handicraft</a> circa 1936\u201338. It looks pretty Futura-like, but I'm most
  interested in identifying the italic (though that uppercase G in the Roman is really
  lovely...).\r\n\r\nCan anyone help with identification or some similar fonts/faces?"
