  keeping an eye on this site for a while now and I love it!! \r\n\r\nI am just looking
  for some advice really. I am about to go into 4th year of my Visual Communications
  degree and have been driving myself mad trying to think of a thesis topic that will
  both hold my attention (as I\u2019m not a natural writer) and will be interesting
  for the reader.\r\n \r\nI found this quote which I liked and found interesting and
  thought that I could use it as a starting point for my thesis \r\n\r\n\"It is no
  exaggeration to say that designers are engaged in nothing less than the manufacture
  of contemporary reality\"  \r\n\r\nI'm thinking of exploring the boundaries between
  promoting and selling, i.e. advertising and graphic design, I would also like to
  look at the promotion of lifestyle through the selling of a particular product or
  service and the branding of the product as a whole (do we buy Coke because it tastes
  better or because we are conditioned to do so?) \r\n\r\nI suppose I\u2019m just
  looking for a few starting points to get my ideas together and a little feed back
  on the idea, is the subject to big? should I think about exploring just one company
  and its use of branding? (Mac could be interesting?)\r\n\r\nAny ideas or suggestions
  will be greatly appreciated! And thank you in advance for your help!\r\n"

    year. This is a topic that has been explored ad infinitum; <em>Adbusters</em>
    magazine has managed to hack away on the topic for years, twice in the last fifty
    years liberal designers have put out a short manifesto on the subject, and just
    about every left-wing  publication brings up the subject on a pretty regular basis.
    So if you want your thesis to tread new ground, come up with something else. But
    if you want to retread this unending, pompous, callow critique of marketing you\u2019ll
    have no trouble dredging up piles of fodder in <em>Adbusters</em>, <em>Mother
    Jones</em>, <em>Utne Reader</em>, <em>Metropolitan</em>, and so on.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In the paper today I saw the reporting of a study where researchers tested
    and found that packaging alone can control tastes. It had kids eat foods packaged
    with the McDonalds logo, and they found a significant preference for the taste
    of food so packaged. This was not based on taste ... even when carrots (not sold
    at McDonalds) were so packaged, the kids preferred the taste to carrots packaged
    other ways.\r\n\r\nThis is significant scientific proof that taste is effected
    by advertising/promotion, at least with kids. (I haven't read the study, only
    the report, which as you know generally falls short of complete reporting of the
    results.)\r\n\r\nIt is something I would look into, if that was to be your topic."

  body: "Don, I didn't read that study, but I would bet the preference had more to
    do with social positioning and a sense that the packaged carrot conveyed more
    status. I bet the kids just said it tasted better.\r\n\r\nEmma, someone posts
    almost weekly looking for help with a thesis. I wouldn't take any hostility personally.\r\n\r\nTry
    and read all you can find that has been published on the subject and then decide
    it you can actually add anything. People pull a full bucket out of a dry well
    all the time."

  body: "Hey, Emma, here are a couple of books that might give you food for thought
    on this topic.\r\n\r\nOne is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Perfect-Thoughts-Modernist-Design/dp/1933045213/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-4503287-1653503?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186548013&sr=1-1\"><strong><em>Chasing
    the Perfect</em></strong></a>, by Natalia Ilyin. (Also, you will find a discussion
    of said book on Speak Up: parts <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/002757.html\"><strong>1</strong></a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/002767.html\"><strong>2</strong></a>.
    And an <a href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/002281.html\"><strong>author
    interview</strong></a> as well.)\r\n\r\nThe other book is a bit older, but gets
    reprinted now and then: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Decoding-Advertisements-Progress-Judith-Williamson/dp/0714526150\"><strong><em>Decoding
    Advertisements</em></strong></a>, by Judith Williamson (which, I must confess,
    I have not read yet.) (A somewhat differing view is offered <a href=\"http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2006/02/decoding_advertiseme.html\"><strong>here</strong></a>.)"

    over and over! So I won\u2019t take it personal! \r\nI don't start my final year
    till the end of September so I have given myself a little time to explore a few
    subject without any pressure from lectures looking for a proposal - and looks
    like its back to the drawing board for now! \r\n\r\nI really want to find a subject
    that will engage the reader but as I said before I'm not a natural writer so I\u2019m
    a little worried about how this will affect my over all grade! The only thing
    is I love design so I'm looking forward to the research end of it!\r\n\r\nAgain
    thank you all for your helpful comments\r\n"

  body: "Emma,\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite advertising topics was UPTOWN cigarettes
    in the late 1980s/early 1990s. The cigarette was advertised and marketed to inner
    cities - using New York's Harlem and Philadelphia's South side (end?). It was
    a fancy box - black, highly glossed, with gold lettering on a angle.\r\n\r\nThe
    black community stood up and asked the manufacturer to remove it. \r\n\r\nWhat
    made me really think about this -- was their advertiser admitted publicly (probably
    the very first time) that they had always marketed their cigarettes towards low
    income blacks and females. (Needless to say, I gave up cigarettes less than a
    year later.)\r\n\r\nBut I always found it an interesting topic and one I always
    hoped someone would develop further, as the newspapers didn't really seem to care
    what the agency was telling us with the power the wield.\r\n\r\nI don't know if
    that helps - but I thought it might fall into line with some of the comments here."
