  trip to Toronto after I graduate at in mid-May; I don't know if you ever get together
  out there, but I would welcome the opportunity to meet while I'm there. I will be
  there from about May 15 to 19. \r\n\r\nI haven't been in Toronto in several years,
  so I'm not sure where a good place to go is anymore. I remember I used to go with
  friends to a place called Pauper's on Bloor West. This might be a good place to
  meet. Anyone interested/available to get together in May?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/toronto_typophiles_6153.gif]"

  body: "I was thinking of getting together either mid-afternoon, around 2:30pm, or
    in the evening around 8. Which do you prefer?\r\n\r\nAlso, how does Pauper's sound
    as a place to meet? Please offer suggestions if you know a better place.\r\n\r\n@Patrick:
    I notice you are a Sheridan grad. I did the Fundies program there back in 2001
    or so."

    with me who did the Fundies Program, nobody that would've been there when you
    were though. Either afternoon or evening are both fine for me."

    doesn't mind me posting this here)\r\n\r\nSubject: Mini-Newsletter Burst Angel
    Fireworks Display - Ray Fenwick\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nAs mentioned previously, my
    Library I show opens tonight here in Toronto. Yeah! \r\n\r\nIf you don't live
    in Toronto, you won't be able to manhandle the books in person with white gloves
    (stop laughing this is serious), which is a shame. You can, however, view every
    single page of every book online, right here:\r\n\r\nhttp://coandco.ca/ray/library/\r\n\r\nYou
    can also see the companion letterpress print here:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/rayfenwick/3528684628/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/rayfenwick/3528684902/\r\n\r\nThat's
    it. Maybe my least outrageous email yet. All business, except for the subject
    line. \r\n\r\nOh, if you do live in Toronto, come to the opening tonight at 1086
    Queen Street West. It starts at 6. The show is a double show, the space being
    shared with Brooklyn artist Sto. (http://www.stoishere.com/)\r\n\r\nTalk to you
    soon,\r\nRay Fenwick and his Brand Management Team\r\n"
