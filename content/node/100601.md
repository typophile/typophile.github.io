body: "I recently came across a book, c. 1990, typeset in A. Frutiger's Iridium (Linotronic
  500), and realized what a beautiful typeface Iridium is. Like a happier Walbaum,
  a more humane Bodoni, a better-crafted New Caledonia...\r\n\r\nAs the Linotype specimen
  sheet, as always, isn't too helpful -- has anyone has ever used the digital version,
  or seen a book typeset in it? \r\n\r\nthanks in advance!\r\n\r\n"

    The only book I found set in (probably digital) Iridium, a pretty low-res scan.
    I'll be able to get it via interlibrary loan, but I'll appreciate more thoughts
    on Iridium nevertheless.\r\nhttp://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521088893&ss=exc"

    the spacing seems too loose.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "If you\u2019re in Berlin or in Mainz, you can probably find a copy of \xBBAdrian
    Frutiger \u2013 Schriften. Das Gesamtwerk\xAB. It contains a sample of the digital
    Iridium (p. 241). For my taste the hairlines are a tiny bit too thin in < 10 pt.
    Depending on your printer it might work though."

    GoldEdition 1.7, so I created this simple comparison using: Iridium LT, Walbaum
    MT, and Waldorf TL. No effort was made to adjust or manually kern the text...
    just a straight comparison.\r\n\r\nhttp://ge.tt/7VAbQiY/v/0?c"

  body: "@Jens, @Michael: thanks! There is a copy of that book near my place, I'll
    go check it out later this week. Looking at the comparison, I'm getting an idea
    of what a great font this could be if the spacing were corrected -- and if it
    came with the small caps and text figures that the original had. Even the \xBBPro\xAB
    (!) version comes without them :("

    the smallcaps, all that can be fixed. Of course there are others here who can
    also do that sort of thing for you.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'by the way, there''s second typeface that Iridium looks like a better version
    of: Slimbach''s Kepler, which for some reason never really appealed to me (despite
    several chances I gave it over the past few years). Maybe one could borrow the
    smcps and osfs from there...'

  body: "That's possible (especially if the MM version of Kepler were used to generate
    just the right matching instance) and it would certainly save time/money. But
    everybody involved would need to own a license to all the fonts in the mix. And
    I'd have to check Iridium's EULA, but in the worst case I can get permission from
    Linotype (I've been with them since 1998, and have some friends there).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
