    start by shaping your tongue like a brush and say \"Cat\", then twist your tongue
    into a chisel shape and say \"itch\" \r\n\r\nFor those not familair with the book
    - here's one for $250 - http://www.oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=20356"

    and to remember the many priests, brothers and sisters who devoted their lives
    to the education of students in the arts. The art department of the University
    of Notre Dame was founded by the priests and brothers of Holy Cross as well and
    as a religious and aspirant to the priesthood, I hope to join their ranks someday.\r\n\r\nSt.
    John the Apostle (patron of typesetters), pray for us!\r\n\r\n\u2014 Michael Lewis,

  body: "Well, the way these things go, popular acclamation is what makes a saint
    a <a href=\"http://www.catholic.org/saints/patron.php\">patron</a> of an occupation
    or a trade, especially in cases where the the technology didn't exist when the
    saint was alive (St. John is often depicted holding a book, so that's where the
    typesetters reference came from, I think). \r\n\r\nWe could co-opt <a href=\"http://www.catholic-forum.com/SAINTS/saintc26.htm\">St.
    Catherine of Bologna</a>, a noted manuscript writer and illuminator, and the patroness
    of the arts. Bloggers already have <a href=\"http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=3877\">St.
    Isidore of Seville</a>, patron of the Internet. (He compiled one of the first
    encyclopedias and, well, was also a hermit.)"

    of a mirror. I just wondered whether the name was a straightforward as it looks
    (apparently yes), and which part of the world it came from, since Google knows
    just about three people in the world with that name, and 99% of them are Father
    Edward Catich. Two or three are called Katich, of whom 185,000 are Australian
    cricketers. Closest I can find seems to be a Jewish first name, Catiche. Which
    I suppose wouldn't change the sound of it very much.\r\n\r\nI hope Father Catich
    will get canonised soon for services rendered to beauty, then we can have him
    as a patron saint."
