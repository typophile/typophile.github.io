  there is a font that is used throughout the issue for titles, subheads, table of
  contents, etc. Unfortunately, I don't have a sample. If anyone is familiar with
  the font, could you please let me know what it is? \r\nI will try to scan a sample
  later, if no one knows off the top of their head.\r\nThanks."
