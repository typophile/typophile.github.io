  body: Hi, great link, I also found a really good links page for Adobe InDesign,
    they had all kinds of great resources for Adobe InDesign there. They had links
    to AWdobe InDesign Forums, InDesign Tutorials, Adobe InDesign Templates etc.  I
    prefer Quark Xpress myself and I was also struggling with some issues using Adobe
    InDesign CS on some customer furnished files. . . <BR> <BR><a href="http://indesign.esmartdesign.com/index.htm"
