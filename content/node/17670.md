  body: "Sounds like I am getting on a theme here, but I think these letters are customized.
    I don't think they are from a font, or if they were, they were modified out of
    recognition with the original. This is really a logo design, I think. The stem
    on the Y is too short, and the N proportions and contrast are quite exaggerated.
    Perfect for this logo, but strange for any type uses, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n-
