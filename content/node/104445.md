body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI need some serious help identifying this font in the photos
  attached. I'm not 100% sure it is an actual font - or it was at one point and then
  played with (obvious but the thunder bolt)\r\n\r\nMy thought process lead me to
  to think it was something like:  'Thirsty Script' but it's not block enough. Then
  i thought it might be a variation on a baseball style. That didn't lead anywhere
  either. I ended up very close with 'TX NineBolt' but it's still not 100% \r\n\r\nAnyone
  else able to help on this one?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"
