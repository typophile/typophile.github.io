    a bit further down and soften the upper right join a bit?

    off the a's stem and putting a slight downward bend in the e's bar would drive

    I like the top one, it feel in more harmony with the rest, I'm even thinking you
    should try a horizontal par.

  body: "Frode, You asked if we liked the first or second one best and showed just
    2 images.  I certainly think there is a nook in the world for an italic font that
    has the e crossbar slanted the opposite way of what is commonly \"accepted\".
    \ To do this, however, it must SING and be lovable as a form.  The sample you
    have shown does not sing or even hum well.  That is not to say that you are not
    capable of making one that does.  It just means that that sample on top does not
    yet do it.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am concerned, screw \"the rules\" and design what
    you want.  You must do it well enough to overcome the furrowed brows of enough
    users to make it worth your while to release though.  It is quite easy to get
    a full bunch of nodding heads that say \"yes, fine job\" if you follow the well
    trodden path of history and knee-jerk acceptance.  The trouble is, you have just
    made \"one more of those like the rest\".  If that is all you seek, just do a
    revival of something already beloved. If, however, you want something that you
    have passion for and that drifts beyond the first standard deviation, then, you
    must choose the path less taken but be willing to get lost, be scorned, and risk
    total failure. You also must be willing to work harder and longer for the slimmest
    chance of reward.  If this sounds intriguing to you, get out your lance and look
    for a windmill[e] to conquer. You may or may not find Dolcim[e]a but you will
    have a happier journey wherever you end up ;-)"
