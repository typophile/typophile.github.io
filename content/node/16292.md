body: "ok currently im creating a bold verison of a typeface i created. what i have
  done so far is make the MM and i went to actions and put in the desired measurements
  in for the bold action and clicked applied. fare enuff that was simple. but it didnt
  create the bold the way i wanted it to. i wanted to create the bold  by just moving
  1 side of the glyph for example on a lowercase n the inside left stem and the outside
  right stem would be moved to make it bolder, so it would not increase too much in
  character width.\r\n\r\ni tried the same with the interpolate tool and it was a
  huge sucess but! i cant replicate the exact number of units i made the glyph wider.
  i went throu all the setting trying to find away to tell and i cant find anything.
  is there something im missing. even in the help file it doesnt state exactly how
  to achieve that. \r\n\r\ncan anyone clue me in if that is possible and the best
  way to go about it.\r\n\r\nthank you"

  body: "Guys, John Hudson pointed out on some 'Interpolate panel' in FontLab, which
    I believe should be available in Window/Panel menu. But my FL doesn't offer any
    close commands in that menu. \r\n\r\nCan you please help where to find standard
    interpolate function? \r\n\r\nSo far I've been drawing fonts in Illustrator which
    takes a lot of time and effort. It would be good to learn alternative (maybe the
    best practice) of how to create different weights by interpolation. Many thanks!"

    Nodes function is a button on the Contour Toolbar.\r\nIf you're talking about
    building different weights through interpolation of two fonts, within FontLab
    you'll want to investigate Multiple Masters."
