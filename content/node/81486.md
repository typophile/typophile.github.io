body: Am I the only one to, after saving a font as UFO in FontForge (22-Feb-2011)
  and then compiling the UFO to TTF, get only half a font out of it? The top half,
  that is.

    save as TTF? If so, are you doing that for any reason other than to check the
    functionality of FontForge's UFO export/import?\r\n\r\nOr are you compiling the
    TTF with something else?"

  body: Hennyway... Got off my bum and did a bit more investigation today on the February
    release. Long to short; when saving a UFO as sfd, FF wrote 'OS2WinDescent' as
    a <em>negative</em> position. To quote R. Frost, that made all the difference.
