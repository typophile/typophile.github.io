body: Is there a way in FontLab to move selected points other than using the arrow
  keys? I hate to reference this to Fontographer, but in that program, if you select
  some points and use the &#42;move&#42; transform utility, only the selected points
  are moved. FontLab

  body: '1. transform selected parts of outlines transformation in the glyphwindow
    <BR> <BR>&#62; transform seems to move all the points in the glyph, whether selected
    &#62; or not. <BR> <BR>this won&#39;t happen if you use the &#39;little&#39; Transform-palette
    &#40;open it via menu : Windows -&#62; Transform&#41; there you find several operations
    wich will work for the only selectet parts of your glyph or for the whole if no
    points are selected. <BR> <BR> 2. transformation in the fontwindow <BR> <BR>you
    can get your shorter dash without the width changed by Tools -&#62; transform
    &#40;or apple-T&#41; -say: 75% -unclick: proportional -unclick: scale metrics
    -choose: center of selection you will get the same result with the &#39;little&#39;
    Transform-palette &#40;you can use it also in the FontWindow for several glyphs&#41;
    <BR> <BR>have fun'

    at a time.

    <BR> <BR>ahh, you&#39;re right. i didn&#39;t get what you wanted to do. but how

  body: Charles, have you figured out how to use the Transform palette to move selected
    points specific distances? It seems from your comments that you haven&#39;t.

  body: Adam, <BR> <BR>No I got it, thanks so much. I&#39;ll get the training wheels
    off pretty soon. I&#39;ve been using Fontographer since the early 1990&#39;s;
    it is, as the musicians say, &#34;in my fingers,&#34; so it will take a while
    to get there with FontLab. Worth the struggle, though, FontLab is a much better
    program. <BR> <BR>I just couldn&#39;t resist adapting the quote from <i>Dirty
    Harry</i> -- much better to enter a number thant to try &amp; remember how many
    &#34;shots&#34; you&#39;ve fired. <BR> <BR>Charles
