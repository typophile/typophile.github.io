body: Okay here's another one that I'm pretty sure is a font. The old ANA logo used
  this font and they actually used it for text before a long time ago. Also there's
  a company in the US/Canada that uses lettering like this style. I hope one of you
  guys can help me!!

    any of them down, however a little creative searching on MyFonts revealed these

    advise doing what I did, which is start with a font like ( http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/deadline/
    ) and using \"more fonts like this\", along with any relevant tag searches that
    come up.\r\n\r\nYou might also find something on DaFont, in the Sci-Fi category.\r\n\r\n-NJ"

  body: Thank you for your help. I'm really certain I saw an add for this company
    using a font which the logo is based on. But that was years ago.

  body: I'm sure they all exist or existed at one point. They're three different faces,
    though. Good luck on your quest!
