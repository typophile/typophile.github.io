    you should find the ability to turn it off.

    is good at kerning and spacing, or shot by someone who is good at shooting people
    at at dawn? Being shot by someone who is lousy at shooting people at dawn might
    last longer and be more painful. Also more entertaining for spectators. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Microsoft&#39;s system of insane menus and illogical groupings of options
    continue to befuddle me. It&#39;s funny that Word is supposed to be so &#39;easy
    to use&#39;. They really mean &#39;does a whole lot without asking&#39;. It&#39;s
    actually tricky to get Word to act like a straight word processor, rather than
    a joke of a layout program that tries to guess whether you&#39;re writing a letter
    or making a bulleted list every three lines.

  body: Chris, I have been using Word since 2.0, and find the menus quite logical.
    Can you give me an example of what you think illogical? <BR> <BR>&#62;It&#39;s
    actually tricky to get Word to act like a straight word processor <BR> <BR>No,
    just turn off auto formating options. You can get to the dialogue box either under
    &#39;format&#39; or &#39;tools&#39;. Logical, right? <BR>

  body: Well, I didn&#39;t think so. <BR>As a Mac graphics user from way back, I usually
    look for the preferences under the Preferences menu item -- format is something
    to do with hard drives? <BR> <BR>BTW, prior to getting OS X in 2003, I had been
    using Word 5, which I acquired in 1991 -- so, despite all Word&#39;s other faults,
    props to Microsoft for making such a durable piece of software that didn&#39;t
    charge an annual upgrade tax.

  body: 'I think what bothered me most was the distribution of the various &#39;auto-features&#39;
    and other preferences in various menus. I just wanted a &#34;turn this feature
    off&#34; checkbox in a Preferences menu, rather than having various menu items
    spread about the applications, or having to turn off each bit individually. <BR>
    <BR>As for illogical setups: for example, under the &#39;Format&#39; menu there&#39;s
    an &#39;Autoformat&#39; submenu. In that menu, you can click Options to change
    the options. That&#39;s logical. Well, the same options are under the Autoformatting
    preferences, which are stored under &#39;Tools&#62;Autocorrect&#39; then you have
    to choose the Autoformatting tab, which contains about 12 individual check boxes,
    which must be undone individually. Why the two methods? Why is Autoformatting
    under Autocorrect? Why can&#39;t I shut it off with one click? <BR> <BR>Another
    &#39;feature&#39; is Word&#39;s habit of replacing fonts it doesn&#39;t have without
    warning the user properly. I&#39;ve had people <i>insist</i> they had Gill Sans
    because Word blithely replaced it with Arial and didn&#39;t tell the user clearly,
    indicating that it was still using Gill Sans. <BR> <BR>Now that I am forced to
    use Word regularly &#40;at work&#41;, I know where everything is. But when I had
    to use public PCs at school for a few years and all of the options would be turned
    back on each time I returned to the machine. Regardless, give me TextEdit any
    day. I&#39;d use WordPad over Word all the time, but it lacks a spell check feature.
    99% of the non-designer users I work with use Word&#39;s formatting features to
    create documents that are <i>much</i> harder to read because they&#39;re bolding,
    italicizing, colorizing and underlining left and right. Word just epitomizes the
    too-many-features mentality of Microsoft. Instead of building apps that each do
    one task &#40;or task set&#41; really well, they try to cram a whole bunch of
    stuff into one thing. I understand the need for things to interoperate, but that&#39;s
    different from feature-bloat. This, in my opinion, just makes easy things more
    complex and complex things confusing. But I suppose this is a whole other topic
    in its own right.'

  body: Hmm. It seems to me pretty logical to put information about auto formatting
    under &#39;format&#39;. If you want to go to &#39;preferences&#39; I think you
    are conditioned by experience with the Mac, which is a different matter than logic.
    It is what you are used to.  <BR> <BR>I do agree with you Chris about Word not
    having a single on-off button for all the autoformatting features. This is not
    a matter of logic, but of Microsoft deciding for you what is good for you, which
    is I agree very annoying.  <BR> <BR>

  body: When I said &#34;That&#39;s logical&#34; about the Autoformatting, I actually
    meant it. It&#39;s the additional path under Autocorrect that seemed illogical.
    <BR> <BR>Word is a good example of an app that has outgrown itself. It wants to
    do too much, but doesn&#39;t take the extra step towards becoming a proper layout
    program. It is, in my experience, an awkward middle step between WordPad and Publisher
    &#40;not that I like Publisher, either&#41;. Granted, it&#39;s usable. I just
    don&#39;t like it.

  body: 'I think the second path is just helping the user. What is most &#39;logical&#39;
    is whatever you would first guess just looking at the names. You might guess either
    &#39;format&#39; or &#39;options&#39; for fiddling with autoformat. Having the
    redundency is actually a good usability feature in my opinion.  <BR> <BR>Also
    all the extra features wouldn&#39;t be bloat or &#39;having outgrown itself&#39;
    as you put it, except that you are forced to use them as default and you have
    to go through a song and dance to turn them off. That is what I really object
    to.  <BR> <BR>I find the automatic list formatting particularly maddening. '
