body: "Can anybody offer some advice?\r\n\r\nI want to buy Elzevir - expensive but
  so  good! I am not sure whether to buy the Book or Regular - can't buy both. The
  bookis slightly heavier, and apparently more akin to how regular would have looked
  during the days of foundry type.\r\n\r\nThe pdf shows both variants, both look excellent,
  and I just cannot make up my mind.\r\n\r\nmy use for it is for body text, letters,
  documents etc\r\n\r\nAnyone have any thoughts!\r\n\r\nJohn"
