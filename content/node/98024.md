    colour. essentially framing the letters much like you would a photo.

    trust us with that. But once you figure out what you're called we can probably
    guide you on the typography.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Agreed. You shouldn\u2019t be thinking about design and fonts before you
    settle on a name. Asking typographers to name your studio is misguided. I would
    stop designing and simply make a list of names bassed on your context and their
    semantic associations. Once you have gotten that nailed down, produce a few concepts.
    <em>Then</em> it would be be appropriate time to ask for feedback and guidance.
    The more legwork you do in advance, the better the feedback you will receive."

    could use the Regular for \"Mr.\" and the Condensed for \"Foto Studio\" underneath.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you can hire a designer to do everything for you (not just a quickie logo)
    then definitely do so.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
