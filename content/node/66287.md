  body: "Thanks for starting the new thread. The biggest problem (or bonus, depending
    on how you look at it), is that these letters are so 'generic' that it should
    be hard to identify, but easy to find a close match, I would think. For example,
    I think the standard weight of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/monotype-grotesque/|Monotype
    Grotesque]] would re-create these letters quite well.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The standard weight of Monotype Grotesque looks nearly identical to Gothic
    720 Roman. The shapes of the letters and the spacing are perfect, but it doesn't
    look quite right to me.\r\n\r\nhere's a comparison using Gothic 720 Roman \r\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/4091/comparisont.png\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I should simulate a medium weight by modifying Arial...\r\n\r\n"

    is too light, you could also try to add a slight stroke to MT Grotesque. Arial,
    although <a href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/articlesarialsid.html\">somehow related
    to MT Grotesque</a>, has a very different feel: wider letterforms, a higher joint
    in the \u2018K\u2019 etc."
