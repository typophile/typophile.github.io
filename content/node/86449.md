  Gothic, which I love. But I am having a hard time figuring out a typeface for the
  body text that goes well with it, probably a serif for better readability.\r\n\r\nCan
  you guys give me a hand on this? Which typefaces you think match century gothic?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Traditionally, Bodoni has been paired with Futura.\r\nThat is because, prior
    to ITC's process-informed revival based on printed samples, Bodoni was considered
    to be primarily geometric in construction and effect."

  body: "I\u2019ve always felt there was a definite connection between the early humanist
    serifs and geometric sans serifs (think circular o/O skeleton and open counters).
    This obviously depends on the kind of geometric face, though. "

  body: Bodoni-style and Futura-style faces tend to go well together. Hell, even I
    saw that twelve years ago with absolutely no graphic or design education at all.
    That's when I got my first Windows 'puter and the first set of fonts.

  body: "With geometric sans serifs, the caps often have essentially oldstyle proportions.\r\n\r\nTo
    me, the real question is, what serifed typeface would I *not* use with Futura
    or Century Gothic? I think anything too \"quirky\" is out. Just about anything
    by Goudy for instance, including Goudy Oldstyle. Anything too calligraphic in
    tone, including many Venetian oldstyle typefaces (Centaur, Adobe Jenson)... so
    no Brioso, probably not even Palatino. \r\n"
