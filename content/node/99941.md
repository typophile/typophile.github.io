  The upper case characters are more or less defined, but I'm having trouble designing
  the lower case ones. I wish to know if there is such a thing as a rule of thumb
  for determining the widths of small case characters in relation to the stroke widths
  of caps. Any other info pertaining to the design of small case characters based
  on caps is very welcomed too!\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

  body: "I see. The initial inspiration came from antique soviet lettering used on
    some books that are laying around my apartment. After that I have used any serif
    font as a source of ideas, from the shape of the serifs to the modulation of the
    O's and so on. As a matter of fact I have not even decided yet the kind of serifs
    I will be using in my final design, nor the final shape of some key glyphs like
    a, g, e, Q\r\n\r\nAnd no, no actual outlines were used, just painful drawing from
    scratch, something that can be better seen in my lowercase g:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen

    of refining to do yet.\r\n\r\nSo, let's return to the initial question of the
    thread please (strokes widths)"

    if the stem of the caps is 90 units, the stem of the lowercase will be something
    arround 82 units (more or less).\r\n\r\nLot of great tips here:\r\nhttp://66.147.242.192/~operinan/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm\r\n\r\nI

  body: "Thanks Pablo, that's what I noticed after measuring some random samples (the
    lowercase width is around 92% of the upper case's). Nevertheless,  I also noticed
    that in some fonts this difference is minimal, specially in diagonal strokes and
    horizontals. I don't know, maybe I'm doing something wrong but sometimes, to my
    eye, after applying the theoretical widths to a lowercase character it looks a)darker
    or b) lighter.\r\n\r\nI bought Karen Cheng's Designing Type book, I hope it will
    arrive soon!"

  body: "There are optical factors, but there are also design decisions to be made,
    so there isn't one solution. The caps are a different alphabet originally, and
    they are now used to signal a difference, such as the beginning of a sentence.
    Some old style serif caps were quite heavy in relation to the lower case, and
    now some sans have caps with low cap heights and very similar 'color' to the lower
    case. \r\n\r\nBecause the caps take up more space, to have the same 'color' (grey)
    as the lower case they need to be somewhat bolder. But whether you want the caps
    and lower case the same even grey is a question for you to decide. Do you want
    them to have more signaling function, or do you want them to blend in more? The
    answer will tell you how bold you want to make the stems.\r\n\r\n"

    no.  :-)\r\n1) If this is for text, lc comes first, so if anything it should go
    the other way.\r\n2) As William hints, you can't force the two cases to be too
    close* without ruining one, or both.\r\n\r\n* Unless your plans are \"experimental\",

  body: "An important distinction can be made between old style (Garalde) and modern
    (Didone).\r\n\r\nIn the old style genre, the broad nibbed pen informs terminals,
    producing a consistent wedge-shape. So majuscule /C looks like miniscule /c.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    in the modern style, the pointed nib informs terminal shape, producing a variety
    of balls, hooks, triangles and hairlines. So that /C has a triangular top terminal,
    whereas /c has a ball.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t have to slavishly follow convention,
    but this distinction provides a useful benchmark for conceptualizing and organizing
    your terminal strategy between the cases. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for all the comments guys, very useful.\r\n\r\nSometimes I wish there
    was an easier way to generate/compare different variations of a same glyph. I
    wish there was a multiple layers function in FL or something to keep variations
    and activate/deactivate them for comparison. I see myself over and over modifying
    a character, generating the font, previewing in ID and assessing the changes...
    one, 5 times just to think that the ideal solution is between option 1 and the
    last one. Do you have any tips about assessing corrections you make to a glyph?\r\n\r\nAnd
    Pablo, Simplepolator is not working for me, I get an \"There's nothing to wrap?\"
    error."
