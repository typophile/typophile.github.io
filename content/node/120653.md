    don't know where you can acquire it.

  body: "Thanks fvilanakis, but \"Blast\" is not enough for me...even because it's
    also a category when you research fonts...I tried on many websites but cannot
    find it.\r\nSomeone else have suggestions?? Pls experts to me!!"

  body: "Neve78, fvilanakis (Fivos) is the creator of the software FindMyFont.com.\r\n\r\nWhen
    he says that the font is called Blast, he means that he definitively matched it
    to a typeface that is in the software's extensive database. Unfortunately, the
    source of the typeface has changed since it was catalogued, and he no longer knows
    where it may be found/purchased.\r\n\r\nClearer?"

    - the file contains no designer or copyright info.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenshot_01_4868.jpg]\r\n\r\nBlast
    was created (generated) using Altsys Fontographer 3.5 on May 25, 1993 , as a truetype
    font with the exact name of Blast Regular. "

  body: "Vane - if you type   <strong>+fonts +blast</strong>   into Google Search,
    you will eventually find a site that offers the font. I'm not going to link to
    that website because it also offers lots of commercial fonts it shouldn't.\r\n\r\nKnow,
    too, that Blast is a <em>very</em> badly made font."
