  body: Hi Doug, looks like they sent you some PC application (executable) files,
    perhaps further compression? Tell them you need .ttf or .pfb font files to be
    of any use on a mac. I use PC fonts from time to time and they work fine under
    tiger.

  body: They might be PC executable ZIP files. If so, 'squeeze' them with <a href="http://echoone.com/filejuicer/">File
    Juicer</a>. You'll get normal ZIP files on the other end, which are easily openable
    on Mac OS X.

    place. Most end user license agreements do not allow for distributing fonts. You'd
    better obtain a license yourself. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"
