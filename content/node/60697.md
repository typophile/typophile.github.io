  the typeface used as the header on the excellent [[http://www.bookcoverarchive.com/|Book

  body: "Have a look at the Red Rooster version of Bank Gothic called [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/banque-gothique-rr/|Bank
    Gothique]]. The condensed weights look like your sample, without the shading,
    which you can add as layers of gray and white text. Their Silhouette version has
    less shading and would need to be squooshed.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    so it's close but no cigar.\r\n\r\nWouldn't have thought to use bank gothic as
    a starting point! :)\r\n\r\nI'll keep on perusing.  Thank you for your help!"
