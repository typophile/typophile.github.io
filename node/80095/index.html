  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hey folks,

Like the title says i'm looking to buy a good but affordable laser printer, my budget is around 200Euro's. Its going to be for type proofing but also to print out test pages for logo's, magazines etc.

To be honest ive always had HP printers but i really do not like them, always had troubles with them after some time.

is there any brand or specific model you guys can recommended, would really appreciate the help!

(I know there are some topics about this subject but since there's always new models on the market i thought why not ask it again, maybe there's better stuff out there these days)

		<div class="commentbody">thank you for the reply John.

I nobody has some other suggestions worth checking into then i think i'm going for the "Brother HL-5240L"

Its about 100€ cheaper than the model suggested by John.

Hope i don't regret the fact that i went for the cheaper model. 

Maybe another question, would it actually be a smart thing buying a laser printer at the moment, i'm on a mac and the new OS Lion should come out around June...i know some people who's printers became obsolete due to no available drivers for the latest OS.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have the Brother HL5370DW printer as well, and it’s fine, but not really great when it comes to print type in small sizes IMHO. Some scans [[http://typophile.com/node/77541|here.]] All in all, I’d say it’s a very good option if you have a limited budget.

<cite> > would it actually be a smart thing buying a laser printer at the moment, i'm on a mac and the new OS Lion should come out around June

The problem is that you can’t work in March with a printer that you’ll buy in June. Since Brother has been updating the drivers for this model frequently (I was notified of the latest version one week ago or something), I’d say that it will be supported on Lion.</div>
