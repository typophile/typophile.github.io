<div class=commentbody>Why are we letting everyone forming our imaginations for us?
It has gotten to the point that if I want to read a news article, I can't - it only comes in video. I am reminded of music in the 1980s - I liked songs and had my own interpretation of them - and all of a sudden there was MTV. I felt sorry for the generation growing up with that music - they would never be able to go into their minds and see what could emerge.
I wrote a comment Heron2001 on that page -- and I really mean what I wrote. I think that person should first attend some classes in Education about how children are taught to read. Followed up by a trip to a bookstore to see what works and what doesn't work.
Personally, I am not about to sit down with a picture book -- and have "pop-ups" come into my life. I block them on the net - and I will block them in my reading. If I want a picture book - I shall buy one. But if I want a good read, and I want to interpret what the author has said without distraction, I'll go for the tried and true typography that will live on.
Boy is his stuff dated - anyone here using Lithos lately?... Enough. I have real work to do - real page layouts that folks are going to love looking at to read!
What ever happened to READING? Is it really gone....</div>

<div class=commentbody>What a talented guy!
I'd much rather see a spread that looks like it's under water than that boring old-fashioned black-and-white format. Now I know what I've been doing wrong all these years - I must tap into my vibrational frequency and do something about my dynamism on the page; two things that I didn't even know about until now.
Thank goodness he's out there giving us the benefit of his knowledge.
It's strange that he gave no mention of taste and discernment.

That's because he has none.
I'm dealing with a client who also has none - he is the product of market research and focus groups. It's incredibly frustrating because he can't have a plain old reaction to anything, it's all about whether that approach has been successful in the marketplace. We're talking about cookbook design here, not branding strategy. The editor mentioned she liked the design of the Dean & Deluca cookbook and his reaction was: that's a great brand. Which misses the point.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The guy makes the point that plain traditional book typography leaves the text open to interpretation, and doesn’t allow the author to specify the exact points they feel are important. It’s interesting that this criticism is leveled at holy books – any crackpot can read any interpretation they like into a given text. Taken to its extreme maybe we should do away with books completely and have a series of bulleted lists, or better yet a PowerPoint deck?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey wait a minute, isn't this GOOD NEWS for designers!!!!
I mean, it's not like we just get to design *one page* for a paltry fee, and then an editor dumps text into the format to fill up the rest of the book.
Now we get to apply design leverage to <em>EVERY PAGE</em> in the product, and that means: <strong>MORE MONEY.</em>

<div class=commentbody>God Nick. This all makes me think about this nutty marketing guy at a college textbook publisher I worked for. He came in with this intro Spanish book and had the on-staff book designers create every single page as if the whole project was one big Dynamite magazine. This book eventually consumed a full third of the design staff, designing and redesigning for more than two years. When it was finished the whole thing flopped.
I'm afraid there is a perception that for children to learn the entire universe must resemble a box of Lucky Charms.
Maybe we will all evolve until the phone book comes in 200 volumes and every entry resembles a MySpace page.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Seems to me there have been several women type designers in the past 50 years. Perhaps the deal is that none of them designed fonts purely for the purpose of setting a book they had authored. I'll just bet that hers is just so special though (the book and the face) :-)

<div class=commentbody>Good point Si.
Can't think of too many books written by the person who designed the type.
William Morris, of course. Several of his fantasy works, and poetry too.
"Goudy's Type Designs" is written by him, and set in his Italian Old Style. Does that count?
Didn't Eric Gill publish the odd tract set in Perpetua?
Scott Richardson, creative director at Random House Canada, has recently written a novel--but I don't think he designed it. Unless one is self-publishing, this sort of thing can be tricky, politically!

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>After gradually recovering from the tramua of viewing most of this, I started googling to get the story on this crew. The leader seems to be this Kirchenbaum, who says in a self-published interview that she never had an art or design lesson in her life and is bad at dealing with technology.
She teaches middle school in New York City.
The target of her 'Beyond Guttenberg' book are self-publishers like herself, who don't know anything about design and want to learn. This talk, though, was given to the National Speakers Association, which has nothing to do with either design or publishing. It was basically showing off their skills in BS--oops I mean public speaking.
The guy in the video posted by Patty is I don't know who. The contact person at Stunning Books (they sure stun me!) who supposedly is her publisher is called Martin Rimm. Perhaps the other videos mention who the speaker is, if not him.
I don't know if it's the same guy, but there is a Martin Rimm who was an engineering undergrad at Carnegie Mellon who in 1995 wrote an infamous research report about internet pornography, which got into the Georgetown Law Review. But though referred to by Time Magazine and quoted in Congress, it was so bogus that it led to an inquiry and criticism by the Carnegie Mellon faculty. This same Martin Rimm seems to be the author of the book "The Pornographer's Handbook: How to Exploit Women, Dupe Men, & Make Lots of Money".

I find all this information strangely reassuring. So Patty, you might breathe a little easier, as I have, knowing that in all likelihood this crew has never been hired by anybody to design anything.
I have some snake oil that I might contact them about selling, though.

<div class=commentbody>This person should take a lesson from comic books: you do not put text directly on an image.
I've though about how one might do this, as I have considered creating something between comic and fully textual, but I can't think of any reliable way.
Images are a boon for things that are presented factually, and the writers of such works should take a lesson from scientific articles and use plentiful pictures, diagrams, sketches (this one is also good for first person accounts before the creation of popular photography, when sketching was considered a crucial skill), and charts.</div>

No, Kelly Hill designed his book. As Scott is her boss, it was difficult. He's VP Creative at Random House Canada, which includes his publisher, Doubleday. What they did was rearrange everything so that he didn't design any Doubleday titles for that season - nor attend any cover meetings, nor sales conference, so as to keep the author/publisher relationship on the same level as it would be for a regular author.
Still, Kelly knew that one of Scott's favourite fonts was Filosofia... insider info.</div>
