  for the main font. They're using it in upper case only and need a second font for
  lower case characters at smaller sizes that supports cyrillic characters.\r\n\r\nURW++
  seem to do a lot of cyrillic character fonts including Eurostile. I've written to
  them for licensing details. Does anyone have any recommendations for the second
  font that would complement it? It most probably needs to be sans serif.\r\n\r\nQuite
  a tall order I think. If its from the URW++ library then all the better as we only
  need to negotiate the font license with one foundry.\r\n\r\nVery grateful for any
  suggestions. "

    is built with frames so I can''t send you the page link but it says "Character
    Set" with an option for  "OTF Plus: West, East, Cyrillic, Greek, Vietnamese".
    If I''ve somehow made a mistake there by all means let me know.'

  body: "Sorry, I based my assumption on MyFonts\u2019 offering, should have known
    better.\r\nDepending on the size and context, I would say any sans with sufficiently
    large x-height and open counters will do. \r\nSomething like Bureau (http://www.urwpp.de/bri/show_font_details.php?sprache=english&fontnummer=b0b8006t)
    would keep the futuristic feel, but could be a bit too dark even in the regular
    weight."

    know this but jumping between many tasks I sometimes overlook the basics. Bureau
    looks good to me, I'll put it forward as one of the options.\r\n\r\nThanks all."
