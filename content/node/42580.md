  body: Thank you both for your help!  From seeing other examples of this font, it
    is definately the Monoline.  Any ideas as to who else has this font available
    besides the Foundry?

  body: The Foundry doesn't have the most useful web site, but I have found them to
    be very responsive to requests for pricing and licensing info. Shoot 'em an e-mail...
