  body: It reminds me of Antique Olive, perhaps the Nord version, but the Nord version
    is too stretched and the lower-case "g" doesn't look right. I'll keep looking.

  body: 'It''s got a Kabel lowercase <strong>a</strong>, but the rest of it clearly
    isn''t Kabel. The two lowercase <strong>s</strong>''s aren''t identical, and if
    you look closely, neither are the two lowercase <strong>g</strong>''s. Whatever
    font this started out as, somebody worked it over good. '

  body: I don't think this is a proper font, it's not very well drawn, and the shapes
    are bumpy.

  body: Have you tried Incised901 BT Black? It makes a closer match to the "s", but
    I think the tail on the "g" is still off.

  body: "Incised 901 is Bitstream\u2019s version of Antique Olive, so basically the
    same.\r\nBut that\u2019s in many ways very different from what we see in the sample.\r\nI
    agree with Ben. Looks amateurish to me. Btw, how old is this?"

  body: "Actually it looks more like a wannabe Futura ca. 1975 than anything else.\r\nAt
    the time many typesetting houses had similar fonts that were slightly altered
    so they wouldn't have to pay royalties.\r\nThe fonts would have names like \"Photura\"
    etc.\r\n\r\n"
