    copy is one of those Din lookalikes that I can never keep straight - someone else
    will have to ID that one."

    version does.

  body: "Guten Tag,\r\n\r\nI agree with PattyFab that the body copy is probably a
    DIN revival. In fact, it most likely is FF DIN Light.\r\n\r\nCheck out FontShop
    for a sample. http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.9467.11.1\r\n\r\nI
    don't think the other one is Stymie since the ascenders are too short.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck,\r\n\r\nTch\xFCs."

  body: Hey, thank you everybody. I think you're right about it being Tribeca. Anyone
    know how i can get ahold of this font?
