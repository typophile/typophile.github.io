  on a logo which make use of font [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/francker/|Francker]]\r\nI
  need your advice and knowledge about the solution used to construct a capital \"Y\"
  letter in this font. Maybe its my ignorance but i found a corner circled in red
  a bit annoying. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/francker-typophile_6496.png]\r\nPlease
  take a closer look and tell me why this letter is constructed that way? Is there
  any other solution which will help to get rid of the \"corner\"? \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advanced for all your comments."

    appears to me that he/she was recycling the design of the X. In any vector drawing
    program, it's not terribly difficult to extend the slanted sides down so that
    they meet the stem, if that's what you're after."

    body: "hmmm... i know how to extend it in vector program.\r\n\r\nThe problem for
      me is that any changes looks silly - especially when compared with other characters...
      \r\nhere is example of modified and oryginal \"Y\" >  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/francker-system_5573.png]\r\n\r\nMy
      guess is that 'corner' is there because cap hight of letters is quite low, and
      in heavy wheits of this font there is simply no room to do it in different way
      - thats because stem of \"Y\" is becoming quite short.\r\n"

  body: "<em> \u2026why\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nWhen stems cross, they create a dense, thicker
    area.\r\nThis is especially apparent when they cross at an angle, because the
    acute joint \u201C\uFB01lls in\u201D one way or another.\r\nType designers have
    traditionally addressed this issue in letters such as Y by tapering the angled
    strokes (check out Frutiger Black to see this method vigorously applied).\r\nHowever,
    in Francker it appears that the designer would prefer to keep the stems of an
    even thickness, so has devised other means to alleviate the heavy spots. \r\nOne
    of these is to offset the \u201Cchevrons\u201D in X (Frutiger does that too),
    and, interestingly, another is the \u201Cnotched\u201D technique in the Y."

  body: "@design-invader: The 'corner' is there due to the reasons that you and Nick
    Shinn have already mentioned. \r\nDue to the superellipse-inspired design and
    the spurless lowercase letters, the characters of Francker generally look quite
    big compared to those of other more tradionally designed typefaces. To match the
    overall look of the typeface I wanted to keep all the angled strokes of letters
    such as A, K, R, V, X and Y of an almost equal thickness, with only a small taper
    for optical reasons. An extreme taper of the two angled strokes of Y and no 'corner'
    would lead to too much white space  in both sides of the character.\r\nEspecially
    in the heavy weights the characters become very wide compared to their height
    and therefore it was not a good solution just to extend the strokes of the Y as
    shown in your example - the letter would look to much like a V and have a big
    dark spot in the middle.\r\nThe inspiration to the 'notched' design of Y comes
    from the small letter y where the left stroke, in some typefaces (including Francker),
    is connected to the right one so that there becomes a 'corner'.\r\n\r\nAnnoying
    or not - I personally think I have come to the best solution for the Francker
    Y!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAnders Francker\r\nDesigner\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Y_4050.jpg]"
