  faces but with a more strict geometric system named vexation. My goal is to eventually
  have a cohesive family that includes this display face as well as more legible variations
  for other uses. I know I have some serious issues so I would love any feedback you'd
  like to give.\r\nThanks.\r\nTurner.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Vexation_4653.jpg]"
