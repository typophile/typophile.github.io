body: Hey all, <BR> <BR>I know I havn&#39;t been around for awhile...I&#39;ve been
  reading my brains out recently in preparation for a teaching position this fall
  - weird eh - I thought that I was too young to be teaching but then there&#39;s
  some cruel people suggesting that I&#39;m all grown up now, no one will card me
  anymore, and that I could pass as a teacher. So when the offer came round I took
  it.  <BR> <BR>Anyway, my woes aside, I&#39;m looking for an example of Carlovingian
  minuscules for an overhead during the brief history of type class.  <BR>Anyone know
  where I can find some? We&#39;re talking 700AD I know but if anyone knows where
  they are typophiles would right? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance <BR>-t

  body: Is Carlovingian synonymous with <i>Carolingian</i>? Maybe <a href="http://www.textism.com/writing/?id=37">this</a>
    writing history slide show from textism.org will be of interest.

  body: '&#34;Carlovingian writing was named after Carl the Great, and is  one of
    the great developments in writing history. Charlemagne, King of the Franks was
    the main motivator from  AD 768 to AD 814. He appointed Alcuim of York to revise
    the  texts of scriptures and liturgy. The hand of Charlmagne&#39;s  Court Scriptorium
    provided the immediate model for the  Carlovingian minuscule.&#34;'
