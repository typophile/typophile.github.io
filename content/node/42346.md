  body: "From The Font Bureaus\u2019s website:\r\n\r\n<em>Of all his work, C.H. Griffith
    claimed one type, Bell Gothic, as his own design. Griffith Gothic is a revival
    of the 1937 Mergenthaler original, redrawn as the house sans for Fast Company.
    Tobias Frere-Jones drew a six weight series from light and bold, removing linecaster
    adjustments and retaining the pre-emptive thinning of joints as a salient feature.</em>"
