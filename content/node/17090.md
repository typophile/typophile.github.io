  to match the original font. For what it's worth, the book is <cite>The Impact of
  Intervention</cite> by Bruce J. Calder, University of Texas Press, Austin, &copy;
  1984.\r\n\r\nIdentifont says the font is Elmhurst, but I don't think that's quite
  right. I'd also appreciate suggestions of fonts which are close.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nWangden\r\n\r\nP.S.
  Sorry about the distortion created by the lens of my digital camera. I don't have
  a scanner."
