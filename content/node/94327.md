body: "Hey guys,\r\nMy department here is working on updating and improving the branding
  for one of our programs called Home Life Cafe. We need help identifying the serif
  font that is used in the logo so that we can encorporate it throughout the rest
  of the materials and increase unity and consistency. The logo was created as part
  of an illustration for the original program materials by on outside contractor about
  five years ago and we haven't had any luck making contact with her to have her tell
  us which font she used. We're pretty sure the original font is thinner than shown
  and that a stroke was added to the letterforms to make them heavier. Any help you
  can give us would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Home-Life-Cafe-logo_4347.jpg]"
