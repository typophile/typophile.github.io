body: "In my neverending quest to complete just one set of glyphs into a sellable
  font, I become overwhelmed when I see the pros. Usually with scores of fully equipped
  font families under their belt. Foreign chars, ligatures, and all. How does one
  man (or woman) do so much in a lifetime? Especially when it takes me so damn long
  to finish a measly ONE. Am I missing some big secret here?\r\n\r\nI think my main
  problem is I don't know when to stop. This question comes from looking at existing
  fonts. For example, the > was virtually identical to the mirrored <, but a copy
  + paste-on-top reveals minor differences. Is this due to casual carelessness, or
  just the opposite? Since I've attributed it to being intentional, I now draw as
  if my glyphs have to be mathematically point perfect in order for it to be supported
  by the foundries. How good is good enough?\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and I haven't even started
  hinting.\r\n"

    at all times and go slowly. \r\n\r\nMany type designers subcontract out font production
    work or even design and it still takes years and years! [Erik Spikermann and Mike
    Abbink] have. So no worries. Just do you very best.\r\n\r\nMikey ;-)"

    at it, is a big part.  I assume you are attempting this digitally?\r\n\r\nIf this
    is the first \"font\" you've designed, maybe You are not \"being a good client.\"
    I find it's easier when I have a who, telling me what, why, where and especially
    when. In the absence of an actual client, I make one up if I have to to perform
    the vital function of worrying needfully.\r\n\r\nThen, if you think about the
    word font literally you can be a better client by only looking at and judging
    the font used for one precise intended purpose. Practically speaking this makes
    the definition of <em>\"mathematically point perfect\"</em> apply only to a single
    use of the digital outline, and not all possible uses.\r\n\r\nThis focusing of
    your eyes on an actual target, hopefully frees you to use the tools, hit the mark,
    and stop right there, as in \u2014 that looks good, and it works, next glyph,
    or...<strong>next font</strong>.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: koleslaw, to these fine comments I will add one that may be obvious, but it's
    something I learned from my own mistakes... Don't set out to create an entire
    character set without testing a <a href="http://www.fonts.com/AboutFonts/Glossary/_glossary_K.htm"><strong>key
    word</strong></a> first... If you are trying to submit your design to a foundry,
    that may be all you need for starters.

  body: "David,\r\nThanks for the sage advice from a master! I have been working on
    12 different type families for the past 3 years and have yet to move any of them
    out the door. With every thing I do, I learn something and then revisit the whole
    mess to apply it. My growth as a critic of my work easily outpaces my ability
    to complete it.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I think Ricardo's comment is most crucial; save literally months of plodding
    by resolving problems with the test characters. Measure twice, cut once. I didn't
    actually do that with my last release, but I did start it while an intern, and
    I learned what Chris is now learning. Now, when I test out designs, I never go
    beyond keyword stage until I've made up my mind and solved basic design issues,
    and anymore, I don't even start unless there is a brief or specific intended use.
    \r\n\r\nNot sure what your process or tools are, but the enormous character sets
    in Latin typefaces are composites, and the accented characters can be assembled
    in a very short time when the parts are finalized. That step should not drag on,
    and niether should kerning, if spacing is resolved and you use time-savers like
    kerning classes."

  body: "It's good to start on either techno or casual/grunge/distressed fonts, all
    quite legitimate genres.\r\nFor the first, \"point perfect\" is relatively easy,
    and for the second lot, it doesn't really matter.\r\nAnd you don't need a massive
    character set.\r\n\r\nChris, it's software. If a font does well, issue an upgrade
    later if you think the \"features\" are more buggy than charming. You'd be in
    good company, as many type designers have produced \"version 2\" of some very
    popular and well-respected fonts.\r\n"

  body: 'Wow, didn''t expect such a massive response. Thanks for the wise words everyone!
    It''s definitely motivation to keep me going. I''ll start judging with my eyes
    more and worrying less about points aligning and so on (since it''s a casual handwriting
    font) I''ll post it in the critique section soon. '

  body: "koleslaw,\r\n\r\nIts all about stamina isn't it! Your first font is a massive
    undertaking and then slowly it changes. Your point of view will change. Why work
    on one font when you can work on a design matrix that allows you to work on 4
    or 8 or 12 or 16 or 32. As you work in this medium, your stamina and precision
    will increase. If you can't keep 8 or 10 or 32 fonts in your head at one time
    you will have a hard time of it. Crawl before you walk. Eventually you will run!
    (Or maybe not!)\r\n\r\nJames"
