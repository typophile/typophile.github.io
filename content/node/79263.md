body: "Hello, I am currently doing a typography project at Uni, and hoping to do it
  about money. Was just wondering, if anyone has any idea what typefaces are used
  on a British banknotes, like on a \xA35 note... not sure if it's even possible to
  find out as I've tried looking everywhere! Also wondered if maybe it's not public
  knowledge, due to fraud or anything..?\r\nIn which case, I would need to find typefaces
  that resembled those on the banknote, as best as possible...\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be much appreciated!\r\nThanks, Sarah."

  body: "Well, to begin with there are a whole bunch of different \xA35 notes from
    different banks in the different countries, I assume you mean the Bank of England
    one? There are at least eleven or twelve different types of lettering on one of
    those (just counting off [[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_x4DOEF5pP2w/TNfdVwnpLoI/AAAAAAAAAXI/mz51z6lc1uA/s1600/small-5-pound-note.jpg|this]],
    which doesn't even show the obverse side that might have more!) and almost all
    of them (bar the serial numbers) are of course hand-engraved as is usual with
    currency - but some still might well have been based on typefaces. Any particular
    one you're after or just as many as possible?"

  body: Hey, yeah sorry I meant the Bank of England one. There is quite a lot on there
    - looking for any, or as many as possible... since I couldn't find anywhere what
    they are actually called, I was just wondering if anyone knew of any that closely
    resembled them... there's a mixture of sans serif & serif faces on there. I only
    really need similar typefaces for the front side :) Thanks for your response!
