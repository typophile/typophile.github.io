      another image I found on the interweb.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Philosophy%20Sust%20Design_clearer_4202.jpg]

  body: All caps serif fonts are quite hard to identify, so unless you can provide
    a clearer picture this is going to be a tough call. Sorry'boutthis... :^/

  body: "If you have the book and can see the letters clearly, maybe you could try
    using the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php\">Serif Font
    ID Guide</a>. The E, J and M are the only key search letters in your sample, so
    you'll get a few candidate samples to look at, but the samples shown will include
    a G and C that you can also match against the type.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth a
    shot.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    is very close to Janson, but Yves and Mike are right about the small number of
    key letters to look at in this sample \u2013 it's just not very much to go on."
