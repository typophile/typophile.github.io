    whether word shape plays a role in reading is highly suspect, to say the least.
    For example, parallel letterwise recognition would suggest that the potential
    confusion between cap eye and lowercase el would impede reading that kind of text.\r\n\r\nI
    hate questionable methodologies. I'll be curious to hear Kevin Larson's take on
    this article.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
