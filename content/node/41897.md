  I am hoping to get the second set soon as well. James Mosley recommended them to
  me after I started to ask him questions about Elsevier Books and Type.\r\n\r\nI
  am interested in any advice about things to look at and for in these. \r\n\r\nHere
  are some images. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/sets/72157603883339677/\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    usual ones have it at a quite hefty price, if I\u2019m not missing something."

  body: "I got it from Powell's in Portland OR. The European sources do want more
    for it. I used Campusi, Bookfinder4you, Abe, Alibris, and Amazon. In the end the
    2nd one was bought on Amazon.jp There are also Antiquarian sources.  \r\n\r\nWould
    you like help finding a good price? If so, what price (in dollars) would be acceptable?
    What about shipping? If there is a particular think you would like a shot of I
    coould post that to flickr..."

  body: "Hey Eben, thanks for all the informations. I usually use Abebooks or Ebay
    for my type-related acquisitions: Indeed, as with everything at the moment, buying
    stuff in the United States is much cheaper than in Europe, but then shipping either
    sucks or costs a lot. I\u2019m afraid my budget for books is over for this month,
    but eventually I\u2019ll get in touch with you to double-check some items that
    I\u2019m looking at these days. Thanks again."
