  body: "I would just look at other faces done by Adrian Frutiger that have similar
    characteristics, which may prove difficult trying to pair with an egyptian font
    like Serifa.\r\n\r\nI'd probably choose [[http://www.linotype.com/50/apollo-family.html#|Apollo]]
    since it has subtly bracketed serifs which would compliment the slabs."
