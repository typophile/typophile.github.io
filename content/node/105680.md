    Most of this kind of lettering are custom/proprietary. Some I like as alternatives:
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/genos|Genos]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/biome|Biome]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/stainless|Stainless]] Extended, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/Fluctuation|Fluctuation]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/presicav|Presicav]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lamatas/frio|Frio]]\r\nCould
    you provide more information (brand, origin, speedometer...)? That could make
    the search easier."
