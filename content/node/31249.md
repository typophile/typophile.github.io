  4.04), with 2Gb of ram. I'm experiencing regular crashes, when I go to export, print,
  click on the gradient box, select different tools etc. By process of elimination
  I've worked out that the font Optima (given a clean bill of health by Font Doctor)
  is causing crashes. In all probability other fonts are causing problems as well.\r\n\r\nHas
  anyone experience the same problems? And is there a fix??\r\n\r\nWe're considering
  buying in the adobe font library and deleting all our fonts but it's not certain
  to fix the problem?\r\n\r\nCan anyone help?\r\n\r\nAlso I can't seem to post this
  on the adobe site, even though I'm registered - I'm denied access. Could someone
  explain how I post? or do it for me??\r\n\r\nThanks for any help on this matter."

    Suitcase Fusion. \r\n\r\nWe're running alot of old truetype and postscript fonts
    - and it's been suggested that's the problem and that we need to upgrad to all
    opentype. Any ideas?"

    you might call them directly and see if you can't get upgrade pricing. If you
    don't you might consider licensing the fonts you really need anew and then starting
    over with a larger library later.\r\n\r\nSorry, wish I could offer better advice."

  body: "Just to make sure all your options are listed -- some foundries, such as
    Adobe, permit you, the end user, to make an OpenType version of an older Type
    1 or TT font.\r\n\r\nI don't particularly recommend you do this. If your time
    is worth anything, it would likely be cheaper to re-purchase the fonts. And to
    do such a conversion, you need some software. Trans-Type or FontLab cost some
    money, but can make the process easier, once you figure them out.\r\n\r\nAs a
    for-instance, I had long ago made database fonts of all out Type 1 fonts -- we
    ran TeX out of a DOS-box, and could encode fonts on the fly. I often had more
    glyphs in a font than are available in the \"new\" OpenType versions, so repackaging
    them in an OpenType wrapper saves both money and time. This is an odd situation,
    & if something similar isn't at play (or your time is worth nothing), better to
    rebuy. "

  body: "I've also had problems using Optima with CS and CS2 as well. Frequently,
    the file looks fine as an .indd, but when I export it as a pdf, I get gibberish
    where the Optima was. The only solution I've found so far is to make sure I'm
    only running one flavour -- either T1 or TT, doesn't matter which, although TT
    is easier -- and not try to mix them.\r\n\r\n(On the flip side, I've been having
    strangeness with Futura and Word 2004 Mac: when double-clicking a Word document
    and Word firing up, I get a message that Futura is corrupt and that I need to
    disable it. Then Word promptly hangs, and I can't delete the offending document
    because it is \"busy\" -- even though I have no applications open.  \r\n\r\nRebooting
    lets me drop-open the Word doc with TextEdit, but there are a few things, such
    as documents from clients, for example that I really do want to fire up Word with.\r\n\r\nThoughts?)\r\n\r\n"

    a good part of last evening messing around with it -- my first boot attempt got
    me the \"(font name) is corrupt and you should turn it off\" for probably 85%
    of the fonts I have loaded.  (At least it booted up this time, which was an improvement.)
    Clicking OK turned them off: well, that's not a reasonable option!\r\n\r\nJust
    for laughs, I ran the most recent update for Office 2004.\r\n\r\nTurned the fonts
    all back on, tried opening Word again.  Got the message again, and did a Cmd-.
    so it skipped to the next font.  Only had to do it for maybe ten fonts, and then
    it opened properly, with all my fonts listed, but not in their style.  OK, that's
    a compromise I can live with."

    fine everywhere else, but Indesign was listing it with the Chinese fonts and crashed
    any time I tried to print. Even though it checked out fine I'm pretty sure that
    this was actually font corruption as it was from a collection of six TT fonts
    and was the only one of the six causing the problem. \r\n\r\nTry nuking the OS
    install and start over, this time managing fonts from a software-created library
    and only load what you need for projects you're using. If it keeps happening,
    it could be that your fonts are just old and cruddy and you'll have to buy them
    again. But this time make a backup disc and keep the original where it can't get
    lost!"
