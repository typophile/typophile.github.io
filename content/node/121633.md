    body: That would make sense. Just looking at the B and E, the former is heavier
      than the latter. Thanks!

    that it is a bespoke typeface.\r\n\r\nMCA\u2019s website uses a custom version
    of FontFont\u2019s Schulbuch, so they have a history of commissioning type....\r\n\r\n"

  body: "[[http://typophile.com/node/121544#comment-596912|Akira just found the name
    in a PDF]]. It's called 'MCA1967-BoldRounded' with MCA most probably standing
    for Museum of Contemporary Art. So, definitely bespoke and exclusive for MCA Chicago.
    \r\nThanks again to Akira for solving this one\r\nTaking the occasion to drop
    an alternative, commercially available, [[http://tendollarfonts.com/products/neue-droschke|Neue
