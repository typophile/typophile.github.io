  body: Thanks for the help - I've tried Persia Bold but it's not heavy enough. It
    could be an extra bold version. but I can't seem to find it anywhere. Any suggestions?

  body: It's an old headline film font that was called Arpad. Persia seems to be based
    on Arpad Light, but apparently the bolder weights have not been digitized.
