  on headers in MS Word 2007?\r\n\r\nI've already successfully disabled ClearType
  on my Windows XP, and in MS Word 2007 I already have \"Always use ClearType\" (under
  \"Word Options\") unchecked. The main body fonts in MS Word already display as aliased,
  but strangely the headers are still anti-aliased."

    may help. Scroll down to the comments, not the intro part about changing the registry
    key.'
