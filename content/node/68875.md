  feedback. Any and all, really.\r\n\r\nThings I'm mostly pondering right now and
  could use a little ideas on: stylistic diversity is a bit messy; stylistic \"oddities\"
  are lacking a bit too much perhaps; italic is on the drawing board, but still rather
  formative \u2014 know of things that make sense here? Thanks!\r\n\r\n(The name is
  a working title. I prefer having utterly irrelevant working titles, for some reason.)"

  body: "A very good overall design, but I don't like the combination between some
    very traditional, rounded terminals (/a/f/r/s/) with the unusual, contemporary
    cut of other elements (for example, upper right serif of /k/v/w/x/y). As you used
    a sharp cut in other parts (/b/d/u/) and uneven serifs (/m/n/) it may be more
    harmonic to use not-so-rounded terminals.\r\n\r\nDiacritics (acute/grave/circumflex)
    are misplaced. You can take a look on Slimbach's serif fonts to verify an optimal
    placement of these diacritics. Observe that this taller style of acute/grave will
    demand a different shape in uppercases.\r\n\r\nI like your /k/p/m/n/h/K/R, but
    /g/ seems distorted and /e/ is falling to the right.\r\n\r\nComma seems identical
    to Greta's."

  body: "Thanks, guys.\r\n\r\n@riccard0: Working on them. Seems right on all points.\r\n@Freiberger:
    I understand why the terminals could bother you. I'm going for a transition-kind
    of letter, a seventies' Baskerville perhaps, which suits itself to rounded terminals.
    In the /C/G/S/ I do use different terminals. Maybe that's a starting point. Not
    sure about the diacritics yet (angle especially), but willing to see specific
    examples if you can find them. /g/ has been under constant revision ever since
    the start, which might be a sign. /e/ gets two counts here, which says a lot.
    Thanks.\r\n\r\nRe: Greta: hadn't seen that at all. That might very well be the
    only thing it has in common then. Thanks again. Keep 'em coming. I know I will."

  body: "I'm myself developing a serif family and /g/ is by far the most difficult
    character to me. It took me dozens of revisions until I got a decent design.\r\n\r\nThe
    comma got my attention because I like very much the shape you used.\r\n\r\nAbout
    diacritics, the main problem is not with angle but with position. Acute and grave
    are not centered or aligned to character limits. They must be slight dislocated
    from the center to te direction the accent points to. You can use a rule like
    this: acute have one third of its length to the left of middle and two thirds
    to the right. The opposite with grave.\r\n\r\nOf course this is a very general
    rule. You can adopt different positions and, except for extremes, it would not
    be incorrect. But some positions works better than others. Take Minion, Times
    and Meta Serif: each one has a different criteria, but I think Minion works much
    better (as I'm a native Portuguese speaking, I use acute, grave, tilde, circumflex,
    cedilla and dieresis regularly).\r\n\r\nYou may also consider acute and grave
    to be shorter if you plan an extensive language support. Letters with two diacritics
    above will need very much room over uppercase limit."

  body: "Ah, yes. Yes, positions are terrible. You're right. They're not high-priority
    at the moment as I'm mainly trying to get the shapes and metrics right. Thanks
    for the pointers.\r\n\r\nRe: language support. That's the part that's vexing me.
    I want to use this face for my own print things (10pt text and the works), but
    supporting many different languages is more than logical as a selling point. I
    don't know where I got the idea for the highly slanted acute (well, it's in my
    handwriting), but I was happy to discover it in Trinit\xE9 and Lexicon. Dutch
    typefaces. Go figure.\r\n\r\nHere are some updates. A pointy, pointed-pen-inspired
    terminal that has some of the sharpness other shapes have as well (/&/g/k/) and
    some more.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen_2010-03-28_5426.gif]"

  body: The update shows a visible improvement on /g/ and /e/, but /e/ still seems
    a bit inclinate to the right. I prefer your new /s/. /f/ and /y/ are very good.

  body: It's a very nice design. What I noticed is that there is very little spacing
    between words, in the "What is entropy?" and "Abstract objects and mathematics"
    sample texts. Maybe that is due to the fact that the typeface hasn't been kerned?
    The single words doens't look "isolated" enough in the line of text. I guess you
    should work on that issue - the relationship of space between glyphs pairs and
    between words. Besides that, it looks like a nice typeface.
