		<div class="commentbody">I think you&#39;re jumping to conclusions, Hrant, because another explanation for the study results is that we see collections of individual letters and know that those collections only occur in particular words, informed by context. So I see pttaoo, and rather than seeing a bouma shape defined by the p and o and some intervening rounds and a couple of pointy bits, I see a p, two t&#39;s, an a and two o&#39;s, and I know that collection of letters only occurs in potato. This is very much easier if the context is such that I&#39;m expecting to see &#39;potato&#39; in the text. <BR> <BR>Note that I&#39;m not saying that this is true -- I really don&#39;t know, any more than you do -- I&#39;m just pointing out that there is more than one explanation for the test results as reported &#40;we have not actually seen them yet&#41;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The basics &#40;of which this subtopic is part&#41; are really pretty simple once you have the model in your head. <BR> <BR>&#62; the olny thnig thta&#39;s iopmrantt is that the frsit and lsat ltteer of eevry word <BR> <BR>This is for example is a severe over-simplification. Reading is not an all-or-nothing deal, it&#39;s heuristic. There are levels of certainty, and the more proficient the reader the tighter the thresholds are. That&#39;s for example why typos can be glossed over successfully. These levels arise from the interaction -at different priorities- of things like bouma envolopes, semantic context, individual letters, etc. <BR> <BR>Certainly a word where all the middle letters are x-height is more easily read jumbled than one with a single &#34;f&#34; in it for example. BUT my point here is that the <i>favoring</i> of the first and last letters -irrespective of what&#39;s in the middle- supports my theory. <BR> <BR>Part of my theory is that the external envelope &#40;what I sometimes call silhouette - but I&#39;ve realized that could be misleading because a silhouette can have holes while an envolope can&#39;t&#41; of a bouma is more important than the insides. The insides are generally only used in a fallback mechanism. Bouma&#39;s findings&#42; as well as this finding &#40;assuming it does show what we think it&#39;s showing&#41; support this aspect of my theory very well. <BR> <BR>&#42; See his papers: &#34;Visual word recognition of three-letter words as derived from the recognition of the constituent letters&#34;, co-authored with Bouwhuis; and &#34;Visual Interference in the Parafoveal recognition of initial and final letters&#34;. <BR> <BR>Context: of course it&#39;s very important, but it clearly doesn&#39;t explain the favoring of the first and last letters. That&#39;s the clue here. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don&#39;t know Bouma&#39;s theories, but these interesting examples I think refute the idea that the external profile of the whole word is the overriding factor in readability. The internal part of the profile is radically changed, and it is still readable. <BR> <BR>I notice that in some cases the second letter being out of place also has a bigger affect on readability. It is interesting that the algorithm for spell checkers seem to act the same way; if you&#39;ve got the first two letters right, they can guess the rest better than if everything else is right, and the first two messed up.  <BR> <BR>There is clearly some kind of mental heuristic system going on, as Hrant says, but it seems to me that the legibility of the internal parts of the first and last letters are likely an important part of the heuristic, and not simply the external profile.  <BR> <BR>The first and last letters being particularly important also means that making both the left and right halves of the letter easily distinguishable from other letters may be important to readability.  <BR> <BR>If no one has studied this phenomenon, I think there is a lot to learn from it.    </div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;heuristics is based on not getting definite answers  <BR> <BR>I think you are misunderstanding heuristics, at least as conceived by Polya. Heuristics are a series of questions that are guidelines to problem-solving. The answers can be very definite. The difference is that there is a creative gap between question and answer, which can involve a lot of trial and error. In an algorithm, it is a completely set and pre-defined process. <BR> <BR>&#62;a textbook failing of contemporary Western science. <BR> <BR>Hrant, You misunderstand the nature of scientific method. The &#39;exceptions&#39; are key tests of general theories, which must cover all cases. Jonathan Swift, author of Gullivers Travels, similarly said that &#39;natural philosophy&#39; should be called &#39;unnatural philosophy&#39; because it dealt with such weird stuff. He didn&#39;t understand it either.  <BR> <BR>Weird stuff such as electricity and magnetism proved a key to understanding universal principles, and to such technological breakthroughs as the computers and networks we are communicating through.  <BR> <BR>In the case of reading, understanding dyslexia as a test case will, I suspect, be a key to understanding the general normal processes.  <BR> <BR>Incidentally, G Noordzij in &#39;Letterletter&#39; claims that he was able to cure dyslexic children by training them to be aware of the difference in white spaces between the letters.    <BR> <BR>If you want to understand scientific method better, I recommend &#39;Conjectures and Refutations&#39; by Karl Popper &#40;under whom I did my PhD in history and philosophy of science.&#41; For one piece of the electricity and magnetism story you can read my own &#39;Fields of Force: The Development of A World View from Faraday to Einstein.&#39; --Set in van Krimpen&#39;s Spectrum! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">The word &#39;heuristic&#39; according to the dictionaries I have checked comes from the Greek &#39;heurisko&#39; &#40;sorry for the roman letters&#41; meaning &#39;find&#39;. Anything that is an aid to discovery can be called heuristic. Heuristic procedures may lead to definite answers, or not, as the case may be.

		<div class="commentbody">The procedures inbedded in the brain, some of which are described in the book noted by Paul, are evidently heuristic in the correct sense. Normally they lead to a rapid and definite, though sometimes mistaken diciphering of a word. The procedures can also fail to come to a definite conclusion also, as when we fail to dicipher a piece of handwriting. <BR> <BR>Both the mistakes of normal and dyslexic readers I think would be important clues to what the heuristic rules are that are imbedded in our brain. On the positive side, our ability to read mixed up words, as noted in this thread, is also an important clue.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">A term is only useful to the extent it represents something in reality accurately. The way William is using the term might be what the inventor of the word intended, it might even be the way a dictionary defines it &#40;although dictionaries are very good at destroying subtlety&#41; but to me it&#39;s simply not the way the brain works. The way the human brain works &#40;as far I as believe - but that&#39;s always an automatic disclaimer for everybody at any time&#41; is fundamentally different than the way a computer algorithm works in that it doesn&#39;t care to arrive at a &#34;correct&#34; answer - it only cares to move on to the next problem with sufficient certainty. Controlling the type and amount of <i>mistakes</i> is integral to this, whereas an algorithm cannot accomodate mistakes. It&#39;s really a very simple distinction, but a lot of people have a problem with it because it undermines the entire premise behind western science. If you think a human thinks algorithmically like a computer, you need some serious debriefing. <BR> <BR>My problem with western science -the way I see it as starting from Rome, as a qualitative if subtle break from Greece- is simply that it&#39;s too inward-looking, too concerned with the <i>algorithmic</i> results. As a result, it will only go for example from an understanding of dyslexia to one of normal reading by circumstance, not naturally. This is -again- the opposite of the what I might tentatively call the Ancient Way. So the problem with the western study of &#34;exceptions&#34; is that -in practice- the whole point is as a rule made secondary. Just like TV: theoretically very useful to culture, but in practice a tool for brainwashing and making the rich richer. Why do you think indifferent philanthropy is now gone, replaced by large corporations funding university research? Because it&#39;s better for the economy. The whole system is decrepit. <BR> <BR>But to be fair, I guess I had a too-strong reaction to William&#39;s &#34;superior&#34;. The West is not superior, not by a long shot. It&#39;s not how far you can launch a satellite, it&#39;s what you do with it. The West is in fact destroying the world; converting culture to cash, at increasing low rates. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;off the hook if a typo gets through  <BR> <BR>As noted above by Frederik, spelling and proof reading are also not my strong points. I certainly don&#39;t pretend it is anything other than a failing. A few typos in a book is not a cardinal sin, though. <BR> <BR>&#62;Reality is beyond me, in more ways than one. <BR> <BR>I am with John on this. The concept of reality is something beyond us, which we try to grasp as best we can. We always have an imperfect grasp of it. Philosophical idealists say we can dispense with the concept of reality.  <BR> <BR>The idealists are wrong, because our efforts to understand the reality outside ourselves, including other people, is fundamental to our humanity, as well as to science.  <BR> <BR>Philosophical idealism, as Jorge Luis Borges pointed out, is an excuse for wallowing in vanity. It is also a dangerous excuse to unleash unreason upon society. It poisons discourse and politics. Large parts of academia are sickened by it.    <BR> </div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;What reality &#39;is&#39; depends on what language you are speaking <BR> <BR>No, the whole notion of reality is that it is not language dependent. Our certainty about what is real is another matter. We are never sure we are right, and in fact we often err, but that is another matter.  <BR> <BR>If I say &#39;I have three children&#39; or &#39;J&#39;ai trois enfants&#39; or &#39;Ich habe drei Kinder&#39; or &#39;Wo you san haizi&#39; or &#39;Yesh li shalosha banim&#39; it doesn&#39;t change the reality. I do have three children. I may of course be wrong. There may be an extra kid I don&#39;t know about from an old girl friend, but the reality is what it is.  <BR> <BR>And when a person swears before a court that he or she promises to &#39;tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth&#39; we know what is meant - even if there is a translator involved.  <BR> <BR>The whole effort to deny these obvious facts, a move influenced by Husserl, is destructive. It is Husserl in fact who wanted certainty, and thought he could get to it by only describing perception, and &#39;bracketed&#39; the question of whether it corresponded to reality. <BR> <BR>The rottenness of this move becomes evident when we consider the SEARCH for truth, whether it is in science, the courtroom or politics. There truth - correspondence to reality - becomes a regulative idea &#40;as noted by Kant&#41; without which, for example, contradictions are not a problem.  <BR> <BR>It is this abandonment of the critical tradition &#40;a tradition started especially by Socrates&#41; which is the poison in philosophical relativism and idealism. Heidigger&#39;s support of Naziism and Sartre&#39;s support of Stalin are indicators of the evils that relativism can be used to support - because, having denied one reality, evidence doesn&#39;t matter, and you are left with only irrational commitment, and one commitment is as good as another.  <BR> <BR>The fact that relativism is fashionable in the humanities, particularly on the European continent, does not make it any less odious or misguided.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think this has a lot to do with type, but since it has repeatedly come up on this board &#40;I avoided comment before&#41;, I have commented.  <BR> <BR></div>
