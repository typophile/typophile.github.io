  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Many have tried and failed to merge Hebrew into English, or vice versa, on the font design level.

After all, a Semetic typeface stresses horizontal scribe-like strokes, and a European style typefac stresses vertical cut metal-like bars. So, how can they be merged successfully.

Gill tried and failed with each experimentation. Others also fell by the wayside.

Finally, Boruch Gorkin (Monotype licensor to MicroSoft and Apple licencees), a brilliant designer in Manhattan of Russian descent (see www,boruchgorkin.com) succeded in part to make a Hebrew version of Monotype's Ariel (weatch out for those Russians).

But Ariel was a sans serif with almost the same stroke widths horizontal and vertical. He based his design upon Tzvi Narkiss' popular Narkiss design, adjusting its stroke width a bit, and height to sit between the x-height of the English lowercase and the top of the English uppercase, and improved upon a bit of Narkiss' design.

But could anyone make a merger in a serif design for Hebrew with varying widths for the horizontal and vertical strokes, and match the overall color of the page in either language?

This blog shows how.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Is it possible to place an English font text with vertical dominant bars, like in Minion, alongside a Hebrew font text with horizontal dominant strokes? Seems impossible, ayh?

Won't the Hebrew look radically different from the English, and vice versa, in both structure and relative black-white ratio per inch. The Hebrew letterforms will look darker, wider, shorter,compared to the English letterforms, besides the obvious design differences in orientation.

So, the differences are four-fold:
1. Hebrew is horizontal stroke dominant, while English is vertical stroke dominant;
2. Hebrew seems darker, while English seems balanced in color distribution;
3. Hebrew letterforms are proportionately wider in relationship to English letterforms;
4. Hebrew are proportionately shorter in relationship to English letterforms; see Microsoft's poor renditions of popular Hebrew typefaces, often matching by error the single case Hebrew to the lowercase of English. Clearly, a non-Hebrew reader did this, as to most every Hebrew reader, this looks too small for the type size, rendering it ridiculous like a clown wear long pants that are too short for his legs.

How can these 4 challenges be overcome?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1. The orientation difference of horizontal dominance and vertical dominance.

Latin letterforms are printed, and therefore are individual units where the distinction between letters are its dominant vertical bars.

Non-Latim letterforms are scribed, and therefore are much like joined units where the joining-like effect are the dominant horizontal strokes.

If a Latin face has alternatively dominant horizontal strokes, it looks odd. Conversely, if a non-Latin face has alternatively dominant vertical strokes, it looks odd.

What are we gonna do?

Well, this is each group's nature. Change here is unnatural, even perverse.

The way to overcome the natural diversity is found in its bigger picture.

Somewhat like the saying about seeing the tree and missing  the forest, here it's the very opposite: ignore the tree and see the forest.

What does this mean in our context?

Every configuration of text on a page creates a color, a ratio of black to white in a given space.

To merge English with Hebrew requires a similar and compatible, even complimentary, color ratio of black to white in a given space. The greatest completion of English with Hebrew is total submission, where each blends in together. While compability is only a merger which makes due.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">2. Hebrew seems darker, while English seems balanced in color distribution;

Since the eye is tricked by the different orientation, and Hebrew verticasl strokes are often heavier than English vertical bars, the result is that the Hebrew text seems darker than the English.

The way to overcome this is by adjusting the letterspacing, or better the side bars, slightly, so the Hebrew text seems lighter to look at, and better match the English.'

3. Hebrew letterforms are proportionately wider in relationship to English letterforms;

Hebrew is meant to be understood and concentrated upon. Therefore it's wider than English.

English is made to be read speedily. Therefore, it's narrower than Hebrew.

In general, as any Hebrew thinker knows, thinking in English is more superficial, because its letterforms are more narrow. Thinking in Hebrew is much deeper and meaningful, because its letterforms are wider. Broadmindedness versus shallowness. This is why Israeli intelligence supercedes even American intelligence.

Arabic and Iranian etc. thinking and intelligence will be discussed later.

To compensate for this awkward sense when English and Hebrew is combined in the same sentence or paragraph etc., and the way to merge English and Hebrew successfully, is to raise the height of the Hebrew letters to a little below the height of the English uppercase, and well above the height of the English lowercase.

In general, the height and the inter-letterspacing is adjusted carefully to create the illusion of compatibility or completion between the languages.</div>

As above in #3.


There is another factor which I am not listing. Each language's text or book font must be silent, not show-offish, and conducive to blending.

For example, Gorkin's version of Narkiss is blendable. Frank's modification of Vilna is blendable. Even Itamar David's very popular David blends in with a subtle falair.

Eliyahu Koren's clown-like Koren is not a good text typeface, because it's most every letter shouts "look at me; I'm a star". Don't get me wrong it's a beautiful design as display or decorative, but it's not for text.

Eliyahu Koren typeset the Bible and the Jewish prayerbook with the Koren typeface for decades. It became a default standard book font, but it's is really not at all. Study its design and just admit it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is another avenue to make the English letters match the Hebrew letters.

If the type design matches the English horizontal stroke width to the Hebrew vertical stroke width, then yet another dynamic is created, reducing the need for extra inner-letterspacing. Less increasing of the inner-letterspacing is necessary, because the overall color of the Hebrew is much less darker than the overall color of the English.

		<div class="commentbody">My view on this is that when the normative forms of two different scripts rely on distinct stroke contrast patterns, one must seek to harmonise the overall impact of the type on the page, rather than do violence to either script trying to distort it to match the other. Harmonising the weights of the two scripts so that they produce a similar texture on the page is not as simple as harmonising stroke weights, regardless of contrast patterns, because one needs to take into account also the characteristic shapes and letter densities of the two scripts. In this respect, Hebrew and Latin types are in some ways easier to harmonise than Latin and scripts with greater density, e.g. Korean or Chinese.

I've noticed that in Israeli typography, it is common for the Hebrew letters to correspond to the x-height of a matched Latin design. Whereas in European scholarly publishing it is usual for the Hebrew letters to stand taller, between the Latin x-height and cap-height. Either approach can be made to work if compensations are made in other ways for the stroke weight and density.</div>

Hear, hear. I recall seeing a publication (a calendar?) featuring Korean and Arabic (or Kurdish in the Arabic script; I don't remember) side by side. When you have two scripts that are so different in overall structure let alone stroke contrast patterns, you just have to give up and hope that the differences in texture on the page for the two scripts are not too jarring.</div>

Certain Hebrew fonts made by some Americans etc., who knew not Hebrew, did this mistakenly. People like you then wrongly think, G-d has spoken. By doing so, Hebrew is way too small at a readable point size, like the English. Rather, the Hebrew needs to be higher, but not up to the height of the English uppercase, which makes the Hebrew appear way too big.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well in regards to Koren, I couldn't disagree more (but then again, I'm kind of biased).

I think you, as an American, are looking at Hebrew typefaces as an American. As a religious Jew, you are looking at the Hebrew typeface as a religious text.

I do too. It's a problem. I can look at a book typeset in an English font and immediately tell you if it looks good or not, and why. In Hebrew, since I was brought up in the UK, I cannot do this to the same extent.

In Israel, amongst Israelis, Koren is considered to be one of the most legible and beautiful Hebrew typefaces in the world. However, foreigners, used to Vilna and the like from their old prayer books, find it unusual.

It will be interesting to see what happens with this over the next 30 years as the Koren Siddur is now being adopted in American Jewish congregations.

I both agree and disagree. Imo it depends on the situation. The most correct approach for most situations is to, as Israel pointed out, align the Hebrew body height somewhere between the Latin cap- and x-height. This works best with Latin upper- & lowercase. With the somewhat rare, but feasible, lowercase-only situation, then the Hebrew body height can be correctly scaled to x-height. With all-cap Latin, the Hebrew body height should be scaled to cap-height.</div>

With all dues respect to Eliyahu Koren zal's greatness as a designer, and Raphael's trailblazing work as a typesetter, this statement is simply untrue and stems from Raphael's commercial interests.

There are a few Hebrew designs, FrankReuhl, Vilna, Hadasa, David, and Narkis, which excel in popularity in Israel, and Koren follows far behind.

Koren is based upon an ancient Ashkenazic design which preceded the inventions of the printing presses in various parts of the world. Eliyahu Koren zal hacked this design, did not credit its source, and popularized it in the famous Koren Bible. It is not legible, way too narrow, and has too much space between the nikud and the letters, due to the severe limitations of the typesetting machinery of Koren's day.

Spitzers word resonate correct criticism.

The Bible is a special work, treated as holy by both Jew and gentile. It deserves a special font. 

Koren though fails where the eyes concentrates, like in a siddur, a text book of novellae Torah, or an even a lowly newspaper.

Hence,, it was never used that way, until Koren Publishing peddling the OU. In 25 to 50 years, it will disappear, and be replaced with Scott-Martin Kesofsky's Milon, Shlomo, or New Romm Vilna.</div>

Again, I like Raphael, and respect him very much. Eliyahu Koren zal was a world class typographer.

But I call a spade a spade.

A mensch might be politically correct, but isn't being a brown nose?

Narkiss' design originated in the concentration camps. It was never credited. Why?
Koren's famous design appeared in old manuscripts. It was never credited. Why?
Freeman peedles the Koren design as if G-d drew it. It was never used before except for the Bible, and a few ads. What changed besides his hype?</div>

Some people can not attribute much or even anything to another, fearing that they will receive less honor than if people thought that they innovated that thing.

Here too, Narkiss and Koren failed to attribute their source of inspiration, fearing that they would not be regarded as creating these designs but merely reviving them.

Where is that in the Talmud? It's not. Rather: being rude under the excuse of honesty is a violation of Jewish ethics. You are not permitted to defame others, even if it's true—not that I concede that any of your accusations of others are true. When you say things that disparage others, it is not permitted, even if true, as Maimonides makes very clear.

		<div class="commentbody">David, 

I disagree with Moshe Spitzer with all due respect.

Koren is not a design with major Sephardic-like roots. It is an Ashkenazic design that has certain Sephardic-like influences.

We see this in John  Hudson's Adobe Hebrew - a design composed of different influences. A bastard design if you will. :)

Why is this unprofessiional scholar correct, and he erred?

1) If you survey most Hebrew type designs, you will find certain common elements among designs of Sephardic origin, and those of Ashkenazic origin. Koren falls into former category.

2) I saw an ancient document hand scribed in the Koren lettering design, long before there was a printing press and Eliyahu Koren's early ancestors lived, but long after Elijah (Eliyahu in Hebrew) the prophet ascended alive to heaven (5 person have done so until now).

Who is Moshe anyway, a chiloni dib?

So did Brian, but you were quiet. It seems you treat the frum different. This is hypocracy and self-hatred.


It is a documented fact. Koren took a design centuries old and attributed to himself. Is that a hack or not, Bill?

He of course was a great typographer, but let's not allude ourselves. Narkiss was greater. Friedlaender was even greater. David was even greater.

And Scott might become even greater if his dreams come true. Shlomo is many weights. A serif set. A new Romm Vilna. A sans set. Other creations. David did an amazing portfolio. If Scott does another, he'll be greater.

Modeh al haemes. Do not speal sheker.

Rude is a relative social issue. To Nazi society, rude was being Jewish.

Defame others, no. If that person did something sickening, you are obligated to warn others. Obligated. But in Reform ediquette and political corrective niceness, we live and let live. Guy by gay.

Rambam is melamed zchus on a shomer shabbos shomer kashrus, as ruled in the Codes of Jewish law. He respected halacha and believed 100% in Torah. You believe in what you think is common sense, sechel and reforming the Creator to be in your image.

I'll stop after you stop. It's a two-way street. Remember, you threw the first stone. And I am not a pacifist, and don't turn my other cheek.</div>

No, just at your pretty face!

If someone, no matter how precious, throws a stone at me, I pick it up and lobbat it back at him.

My reform rabbi, Rabbi Izzy K. taught me that.

First you spend a few days telling me that you created your Crown font from a document from RIT that had been done before the age of the printing press and then you remember that actually it was from a book on typefaces that you bought a flea market in Israel.

I would love to know which one it was and if it's the latter (which is what you told me a few years ago on the telephone), then would you mind scanning in the page because it's been talked so much about that I think everyone on this forum would love to see.

I posted on the Microsoft thread the prototype version of Koren that was done by hand on the book of Jonah. I have taken the liberty of reposting here too. I think that this demonstrates the evolution from that to the currect Koren (not Koreen or Keren or Crown versions of the) font.

I would be curious to see if this image in any way can been seen as an evolution from your source and if so, it would be amazing to see that you skipped a step in total isolation and arrived at a very similar result.

		<div class="commentbody">This is improved, but...

the diacritics are too low, Koren Bible style
the meteg is too close to the nikkud
-it is higher than the nikkud
- some taamim are lower while others are at the nikkud's height level
 
much is either koren bible style or due to the very large nikkud
most hebrew fonts do not have such large nikkud
for the koren bible it worked, but for most jobs it doesn't

i recall now that for crown i cut apart the sample
and assemble different letters on a post board
like rashi and romm vilna
i lacked different crown letters, not many
i enlargenned the poster board on a stat machine, not a copy machine
this produces great quality
i supplemented the missing letters from another source
perhaps the source for the bold
i never had a light
the bold source was giant
i no longer have it
i never completed crown for two decades
i rotated some of the letters
cleaned up the scans
copyrighted a very early version
only added nikkud from henri designed by john hudson (the nikkud etc)
much better than in koren
eliyahu lifted the nikkud from another font
they simply don't match

raphael, you are reviving koren
this is a great thing
before kp you wouldn't have bragged about it so much

		<div class="commentbody">On the subject of merging Hebrew and English...

After Charlemagne originated the notion of using the Latin alphabet with capital letters based on Roman monumental script, and lowercase letters based on the uncial, this practice was spread to the Greek language - and Armenian and Cyrillic also have upper and lower case.

I came across this article a while back,

[[http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2006/02/hebrew-alphabet-reform_13.html]]

about a bizarre proposal to give Hebrew a lower case. I would think that there's a much simpler way to make a Hebrew with a lower case, without having to redraw the letters in a foreign style, if anyone wanted it.

Just make the conventional square script the upper case, and the ancient forms of the letters - in the Paleo Mesha style, where the ascenders and descenders are pronounced - the lowercase!

There was even Eric Gill's odd attempt at making Hebrew look more like the Latin alphabet. While giving Gujarati that treatment might produce interesting results, and this is no worse than many other cute display faces, the serifs point the wrong way.

Ah, and here's another interesting article:

		<div class="commentbody">This isn't a "revival" of Koren. This <em>is</em> Koren!

I wanted to post the Koren lines to demonstrate the evolution of Koren's prototype to his final font. I'm not posting to get your opinion on the font. I'm showing you how he arrived at this font.

You, on the other hand, keep saying how your Crown is authentic, it was done based on some piece of paper that has disappeared. 

That is all. 

In the digitisation process we were not looking to improve or change the Koren font. It is 100% the same. When we print from the new font, you can't tell the difference from text being set from lead and from opentype. It's critical for us to have that ability.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, Raphael, so is your claim that Koren pulled his typeface out of a hat. And the hat he wore to cover his genius. 

If he was such a great genius, why did he only make one face. Maybe, you'll refer to his Siddur font with the dorky aleph. Personally, I think the Siddur face reflects the opposite of genius.

Friedlaender never claimed that he had no major influences. He never claimed genius. But his Hadasa was also great. 

I think it is much greater than Koren.

About the drawing at RIT, I have no need to find it again. For you - what a joke!

If you want to sue me for Crown, which is more authentic than Koren's with stolen nikkud and lack of acknowledgement of his sources.

Sue. I could use the publicity. 

Should I donate it to Microsoft for Office. Bill Gates is becoming a tzaddik goy - he said, the wealthy billionaires should give away 90% of their wealth; the remainder is enough to enjoy the rest of life. Sounds like a tzaddik to me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think he pulled the typeface out of a hat. I think he studied many manuscripts and had a instinct as to what the form of the letter should be. I think he then started to draw letters which he put into Yona. After setting the chapter, he started to turn it into a digital font. I don't think Koren ever claimed he was a genius and I certainly have never made such a claim. You have said he was a genius, these are not my words. There was a study done on the differences between the Siddur font and the Tanakh font by Simon Prais. If you don't like the font, why don't you say that you don't like the font. Why talk about genius and other typographers. If I am critiquing your typeface, I don't prove my point by saying that some other type designer is a friend of mine on facebook. I critique the font based on my opinion.

Who said he only made one face? He made 2 Koren faces, the Tanakh and the Siddur which are quite different (not just the aleph), 3 Rashi faces, and a sans serif face. He also worked on a number of different faces too, but remember what Koren brought to the world wasn't just a few typefaces, but rather his Tanakh which is considered to be the most accurate in the world and his siddurim which again are world-acclaimed for their accuracy. I think you really don't understand what Koren is about.

Please do find the drawing, just for me. Thanks :-)

I've never suggested suing anybody. I've tried to keep the threads on the forum about typography and not about law, or religion or philosophy or anything else. Thanks for the compliment about my kids, but again not appropriate for a forum on typography (unless you think that they resemble some font). That is what facebook is for not typophile.

I think that the original link by William Berkson was posting something that is of interest to people who design fonts and brings up an interesting discussion on what is "okay" and what is not "okay" in the typographic world.

So far, we saw 3 fonts. You say there are more. Please post samples of them. Do you have drawings of them too?

Was Koren a Genius?
Clearly, he was a very talented and great type professional. His Tanach was a great feat, and people check their texts against it, as I do.

Lost Manuscript
Blee neder, I shall find the lost manuscript at RIT, but it may be in a few years when I go to the Vogel's wedding for Mushka. Rabbi Vogel is from London, and played with diamonds as a kid, when we played with jacks. But only if you post his Rashis. :)

Readability
I contend the Koren font is not readable to the Hebrew reader. To me, it's a no brainer. You site the Israeli reading experts that he went to for advice. That's commendable, but often such experts in Israel just say the opposite that chazal say. So, whoee whoee on them.

Cute kids on Facebook
As one who has no derech eretz, or limud zchus for people who laugh at shmirat shabbat or shmirat kashrut (see Codes of Jewish law regarding when to appy this and when it's assur), I try to instill a sense of personality and warmth her. Type expresses feeling, so we should express feeling.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes he did design more. We are currently digitising one of his Rashi's which I like very much. For obvious reasons, I'm hardly going to post them on the internet!

Again, I never contended he was a genius. You keep saying that.

If you don't think the Koren font is readable then that's okay. I'm not offended. I'm just saying what his process was. Whether you (or I for that matter) think it was a good process or not is irrelevant. I'm establishing the evolution of the font from what I posted of the Yona (Jonah) example to what he was finally printed in 1962. I also agree with you on the fact that the Koren font is not as readable as other typefaces at very small font sizes. But then again, if you saw the size of the Koren Tanakh that he printed http://www.korenpub.com/EN/products/tanakh/sifrei_tanakh/9789653010741 you'll see that a small sized Bible was not what he was about!
