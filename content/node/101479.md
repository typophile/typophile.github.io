  of a typeface that represented these sort of values of a person:\r\n\r\nhonest,
  approachable, reliable, the original 'Mc'coy', and homely\r\n\r\nI wondered if a
  serif typeface said 'stern' too much, so maybe a Sans Serif is more appropriate\r\n\r\nBy
  'Original' I mean someone that has been about for years but is still among the best
  but maybe needing to be more modern\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "FS Clerkenwell looks nice, especially as it's British. Joanna could be a
    possibility.\r\n\r\nI like the 'feminine yet rigid' aspect of the Ernestine, which
    is another aspect I was looking for which was to be feminine - not necessarily
    too feminine though\r\n\r\nRufus has a slight feminine look to it too which is
    nice \r\n\r\nThis font looks nice - not sure which it is though - has a feminine
    appearance to it.\r\n\r\nhttp://oi46.tinypic.com/567tt.jpg (not sure how to link

  body: How about [[http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/maple/|Maple from Process
    Type Foundry]]? It would seem to fit the brief, and if being British is a plus
    its starting point was an 19th-c. English typefounder's design.

    Toast looks too Archaic, thanks though.\r\n\r\nMaple is very nice - gives an alternative
    to the Serif style too.\r\n\r\n"
