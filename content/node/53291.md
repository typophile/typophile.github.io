    nobody knows which font this is?\r\n\r\nAs the movie Tystnaden is from 63, I guess
    the font might not be digitized...?\r\n\r\nI\xB4m posting another image with more
    letters from the same font.\r\n\r\nThanks anyway!\r\n\r\nTimo\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IngmarBergman_6380.jpg]"
