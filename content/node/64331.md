  body: 'Have a look at <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?55Z">John Sans Condensed</a>.
    It has a wide range of weights, has all diacritics on board and quite a soft look,
    especially in the lowercase. '

    has a ton of condensed/compressed cuts.\r\nCome to think of it, their recent <a
    href=\"http://typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100035\">Tungsten</a>
    might also be worth a look."

  body: "Have a look at the condensed styles of Cyrus Highsmith's [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Antenna|Antenna]].
    They have a fresh look, and the angularity of Highsmith's style seems to work
    particularly well in condensed styles.\r\n\r\nI was very impressed with how well
    the different weights and styles of [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans|Benton
    Sans]] worked together in Armin Vit's catalog for this year's TypeCon. This design
    was worked on first by Tobias Frere-Jones and then Highsmith. It is originally
    based on Trade Gothic, but worth a look. \r\n"

    Fuller Benton's various sans serif series for ATF (including News Gothic, Franklin
    Gothic, and Lightline Gothic); hence the name.\r\n\r\nTrade Gothic was Jackson
    Burke's variation on the theme, designed for Linotype a couple decades after Benton's.\r\n\r\n"
