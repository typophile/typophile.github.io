  with the opentype font liza:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=liza&id2=test\r\n\r\nOnly
  how can i code with opentype that it grabs another 'd' for example if it's the second
  d in a word or in the total text?"

    ignore sub @Letters @Letters d';\r\nsub @Letters d' by d.alt; </code>\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure how one would handle the second case."
