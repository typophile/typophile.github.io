  Finnish Architecture. The image here is a screenshot from the museum's [[http://www.mfa.fi/|website]].
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rakennustait_museo_6308.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  typeface resembles Univers, but especially the E, O and S are different.\r\n\r\nHopefully
  someone can help me out. Thank you!"
