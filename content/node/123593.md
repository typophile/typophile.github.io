body: "I'm a bit curious if there is a business logic to a designer selling older
  versions of their fonts rather than their newest version. Of particular note is
  Canada Type. Today, as an example, Fonts.com updated the Canada Type library, but
  a substantial number of the typefaces being sold are older versions, such as Trump
  Gothic and Dutch Mediaeval, which now is version 2, with 886 characters, but on
  Fonts.com, youworkforthem.com, and fontbros.com, what is being sold is version 1
  with 600 characters. Fonts.com & youworkforthem character info tables:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/canada-type/dutch-mediaeval/regular\r\nhttps://www.youworkforthem.com/font/T0198/dutch-mediaeval\r\n\r\nI've
  actually emailed Canada Type, and their excuse was that it was the distributors
  fault. But 3 different distributors selling the same old fonts just doesn't make
  a great deal of sense to me. \r\n\r\nI'm not trying to pick on Canada Type, they
  certainly are not the only foundries to sell older versions of their fonts (FontBureau
  and Elsner+Flake also sell older versions of their fonts via distributors such as
  fonts.com, etc.) \r\n\r\nIs there some business logic for this?"

    it's an accident makes sense.\r\n\r\nCertainly companies selling software sometimes
    give away older versions of the program for free because the features are no longer
    competitive, and it will get people interested in getting the current version.\r\n\r\nWith
    fonts, it is seldom that there would be a comparable value increase in a newer
    version, but it's certainly possible that the difference between the old version
    and the new version might be the same as that between a 'basic' version and a
    'pro' version, and the pricing could reflect that."

  body: "I can\u2019t speak for other foundries, but as a general answer: if you have
    a lot of fonts and sell them through a lot of channels, updates take a reeeeeally
    long time. There are usually no automated processes for that. It\u2019s all arranged
    manually with each reseller. That takes time. And if you push out your 2.0 release
    and customers downloading it find a new bug, you need to start all over again
    for the 2.0.1 release. So it isn\u2019t surprising that foundries either postpone
    the reseller updates, or just don\u2019t do them at all and keep the older versions
    there which have shown to work without problems. \r\nIf you find that you have
    an older version from a reseller, just email the foundry and they will usually
    send you the update. "
