  its primary font: http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/parka/\r\n\r\nSince it is not
  offered as a webfont yet we are searching for an alternative that would be suited
  for web use. Currently I've found a range of FontFonts that share a similar character:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-meta/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/kievit/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-fago/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/sero-pro/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-transit/
  \r\n\r\ndoes anyone have any other alternatives he/she can recommend?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nJ\xFCrgen\r\n"
