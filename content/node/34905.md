    of his fonts. Might be worth checking out. http://www.fontcraft.com/

  body: "Thanks everyone.\r\nI actually found a couple of free fonts that work quite
    well.\r\n(It\u2019ll be just for a title.)\r\nI didn\u2019t want it to look too
    blackletterish/gothicy.\r\nThat\u2019s what I like about this pirate theme interpretation.\r\n\r\nI
    was more or less curious what the origins of that logotype could be."

    some flourishes have been added. Like on the bottom of the P and one of the B's\r\n\r\nSee
    lowercase N - pretty good match? I think it could possibly have been made starting
    with this."
