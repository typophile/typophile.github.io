		<div class="commentbody">uhmm I almost post similar topic. anyway! my question is where is good school (bachelor degree or associate of art) to learn typography at USA or Canada or Northern Europe? I saw some schools like Art center and School of Visual art. Their curriculum quite promising  but its very expensive! I don&rsquo;t think even with a loan, I can get the money to go to school at there and living at there. Also, is a degree is really matter in the typography/design world? I want to graduate with a knowledge at least how to make my own typefaces. I want to try Ai Schools but uhmmm&hellip;.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean typography or type design?&rdquo;
Hmmm both? I want to be good in typography and also, have big! knowledge of type design. 
I mean, I am just want to into at typography(logos,poster,motion title,experimental type design). I am not that fancy when it comes to packaging design (but I must take it!if Choose to learn graphic design <strong>sigh</strong> )</p>
<p>I did heard about Academy of Visual Arts in Leipzig but! I don&rsquo;t think they are teaching in English :( I am thinking to go to Sweden but I still have no clue about which schools is good at there.</p>
<p>yeah..! if only typophile can offer a degree! it would be awesome! even its going to be long-distance learning. A lot of schools offer that!</p>

<p>Ocad has a graphic design program that covers all of what you&rsquo;re after. They also have a very good type design teacher, Greg Van Alstyne. You can take typeface design as electives and there are several mandatory typography courses.</p>

<p>Oy.  When I was doing my Masters defence (in Environmental Design), you had to incorporate the words &ldquo;a sense of place&rdquo; somewhere, on threat of being forced to rewrite and redefend.</p>
<p>Back when I lived near DC, I remember watching an advert for some &ldquo;institution&rdquo; that had a guy saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done so well since I got two Masters, I decided to get a third.&rdquo;</p>

Yeah, I personally think its better to go to Europe for design.</p>
<p>Which part of Europe you guys recommend it? I really want to go to London but I am just afraid the cost of living can cost me double. Other than that, I&rsquo;m really considering to go to Netherland or Sweden and yeah,I am thinking to learn basic conversation of their language first before I am going to the university.</p>

<p>I really dun mind to go to Norway or Sweden (lower cost, have few fav design agencies that and also, they speak English)
Plus! I prefer northern europe cuz I always fancy their culture and uh uh uh gurls</p>
<p><strong>sigh</strong> why they only teach only on Germany or French :( Maybe I should moving to Netherland and ask my grandmother to teach me the language.</p>
<p>Any suggestion around Asia? <strong>totally going to be very low cost for me lol</strong></p>
<p>Btw, the Program from Bergen so far look what I am looking for and they have a website in english. I should contact them to learn more about the tuitions etc</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Because: (these are just my guesses…)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>German, French, Italian, and Rheto-Romanish are Switzerland&rsquo;s four official languages. German and French are the two biggest. Zürich is in the German-speaking part of the country. Despite the increasing amount of English spoken among Swiss, the official &ldquo;second&rdquo; language in Zürich is likely to be French.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both the University of Reading in the UK and KABK in the Netherlands teach their postgraduate typeface design courses in English, even though the Netherlands, for example, only has one official language—and by golly, it isn&rsquo;t even English!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The French and the Germans (as well as, err… the Swiss) have their own brilliant histories of typeface design, which are rather quite separate from England&rsquo;s and that of the United States. Maybe they&rsquo;d like to continue working in these spirits instead of, umm, burying them ;-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So that people who come from other countries to study there go through the effort of learning the local language and expanding their own minds and horizons at the same time. The whole world doesn&rsquo;t speak English, nor should it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switzerland only joined the United Nations a few years ago, and heaven only knows if they will ever join the EU. They are a democracy, and they like doing things the way they please.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m sitting in my Toronto studio, it&rsquo;s -6 with 35km snowy winds. Which is why we&rsquo;re moving to Spain :)</p>
<p>Anyway I wouldn&rsquo;t go to Asia for school. I think generally it&rsquo;s a better idea to go to Asia after you have some experience as it can be hard to start out there. I&rsquo;m talking mostly about Singapore and Dubai.</p>

<p>Miss Haley hahaha yeah I know what you mean but seriously, I prefer -15 degree with snowy winds rather than hot humid season. I am originally from Singapore and yeah! it&rsquo;s really hard to starting out at there. Most of my friends complained a lot cuz at there work 7 days a week with min 12 hours shift (they don&rsquo;t get any health benefit)</p>
<p>Spain eh? fancy..! 
btw, I saw your website and seems you have some experience with interactive design. I just wondering, is that hard as a starter interactive designer? should I be good at action script? or just have good graphic design portfolio?cuz so far, most of the agencies in here looking more flash wizard.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First off you&rsquo;re crazy for liking the winter!!</p>
<p>I love working in interactive. As for coding, my office is larger (around 700 people), so we have the budget to have people to do the coding for us. My job is mostly all concept work and design. But I do know Flash and Actionscript because I don&rsquo;t think you can adequately design something to be produced in Flash if you don&rsquo;t understand the program or how the web works and how users interact with it. My boyfriend is also in interactive in a smaller agency (50 people) and because of that he needs to do some coding and flash work.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want to apply to an agency as a flash person because you probably won&rsquo;t be doing much of your own creative work. Flash people = production, not creative. It&rsquo;s smarter to get an in as a creative intern then it is as production. Basically what&rsquo;s happening in the industry now is clients are expecting web elements to all their campaigns, where-as before it was more of a specialized thing. So agencies had to start outsourcing the production of the sites to smaller development companies until they realized they were getting totally fleeced by them. That&rsquo;s why there are so many flash and programming jobs opening up in-house right now.</p>
