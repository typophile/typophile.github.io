body: This is something I've wondered for a while. Given that Microsoft originally
  shipped Windows with Book Antiqua, and then eventually started licensing a legit
  version of Palatino, it would seem like a possibility that they could do the same
  for Arial/Helvetica. Granted, Book Antiqua wasn't as ubiquitous as Arial is, and
  thus was easier to abandon. But it seems they're paying more attention towards design
  and following more of designers' advice in their recent software, so does anyone
  ever see this happening?

    generally favours practicality over design purity and occasionally goes out of
    its way to support legacy software."

  body: "Windows <em>3.1</em> introduced TrueType fonts, and largely as a result of
    that, it was a success where Windows 3.0 had been largely ignored (Microsoft even
    had a deal with Logitech were you could get a free copy of Windows 3.0 when you
    bought a Logitech mouse).\r\n\r\nArial, although width-compatible with Helvetica,
    is derived from the font outlines of a Monotype sans-serif typeface, and thus
    it's a legitimate typeface. Various approximations and imitations of Helvetica
    are available cheaply or for free to Windows users, so the fact that it doesn't
    come with Windows is not really a problem for anyone who has a document to print
    on a laser printer for which Helvetica would look right, and Monotype Grotesque
    would look wrong.\r\n\r\nThat being said, though, I can understand why an attitude
    of 'who cares' might be rejected. Not that Arial is a <em>bad</em> typeface, but
    Helvetica is historically significant, and it has aesthetic qualities which are
    well recognized. I think Helvetica Medium is quite beautiful on signage myself.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    so, having that as an automatic default - as most computer users care little and
    know less about typography - would presumably contribute to an elevation of typographic
    taste or some such thing.\r\n\r\nOf course, Helvetica, like Times Roman, is so
    highly popular that it has its detractors as well. I'm not one to reject a typeface
    merely because it's popular. I'm not even particularly hostile for Papyrus - I
    think it fills its particular niche quite well, a niche for which there is a lot
    of demand these days.\r\n\r\nBut I might be sympathetic enough to those critical
    of Helvetica to express the wish that if Microsoft were to include a copy of Helvetica
    with every copy of Windows, they might also spring for a copy of <em>Univers</em>
    as well. (I suppose people would have to get Microsoft Word to have Franklin Gothic
    and News Gothic as alternate choices.)\r\n\r\nHelvetica, beautiful as it is, is
    more of a display sans-serif than a <em>text</em> sans-serif, while, although
    I find Univers bland and uninspiring by comparison, I have to admit that it better
    fills the role of a text face.\r\n\r\nOf course, it would also be nice if people
    could choose Century Expanded or Baskerville in Windows, instead of just Georgia,
    as a serif alternative to Times Roman. Again, one has more choices if one springs
    for Microsoft Office."
