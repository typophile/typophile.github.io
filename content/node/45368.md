body: "The Beta version of Adobe Flash Player 10 was just released on Adobe Labs.
  Among the many enhancements, there is a new Text Engine which comes along with an
  extensive library of ActionScript 3.0 Text Layout Components. Here's the blurb from
  the [[http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/releasenotes.html|release
  notes]].\r\n\r\n<em><strong>New Text Engine</strong>\r\nA new, highly flexible text
  layout engine, co-existing with TextField, enables innovation in creating new text
  controls by providing low-level access to text layout and interactivity APIs to
  create component-level text objects.  The new text engine expands creative freedom
  by treating device fonts as first class citizens that can be anti-aliased, rotated,
  and styled and have filters applied as if they were embedded.  The new text engine
  also offers right-to-left and vertical text layout, plus support for typographic
  elements like ligatures.\r\n\r\n<strong>Text Layout Components</strong>\r\nAn extensible
  library of ActionScript 3.0 text components, coming in future to Adobe Labs, provides
  advanced, easy-to-integrate layout functionality that enables typographic creative
  expression.  Layout and style text with tables, inline images, and column flow through
  components that are compatible with both Flash and Flex, all while getting the benefits
  of the new text engine.  Rich text components allow designers and developers to
  flow text and complex scripts, such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Thai, across multiple
  columns like a newspaper, around tables and inline images, from right-to-left, left-to-right,
  bi-directionally, or vertically.  Selection, editing, and wrapping of text are handled
  as would be expected for the different layouts.\r\n\r\n<strong>Anti-Aliasing Engine
  (Saffron 3.1)</strong>\r\nAn update to the Saffron anti-aliasing text engine increases
  performance and quality of anti-aliased text, particularly for Asian character rendering.
  \ Support for stroke fonts reduces memory requirements.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's right,
  support for Complex Scripts and OpenType features is coming to the Flash platform.
  These are great news!\r\n\r\n[[http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/demos/videos/text.html|Take
  a look at the video. It features Hypatia Sans Pro]] :^)"

  body: I think support for Contextual alternates (calt) is there as well, along with
    a few other features (e.g. Discretionary ligatures, otherwise we wouldn't see
    Hypatia's 'st' ligature or the cap ligatures). But I need to ask around to get
    the full list. And surely Thomas will soon blog about it, providing a lot more
    details.

  body: Great! I've been wishing for OT support in Flash ever since I started making
    OT fonts. It's been really frustrating having to tell customers using Flash that
    they can't have any of the type goodies. Is OT support coming for Fireworks? That
    would be nice, too.

    been recently made available]]. I had a look at the classes included in the <code>flash.text.engine</code>
    package, and there's some interesting stuff there,\r\n\r\nDigitCase (DEFAULT,
    LINING, OLD_STYLE)\r\nDigitWidth (DEFAULT, PROPORTIONAL, TABULAR)\r\nKerning (AUTO,
    OFF, ON)\r\nLigatureLevel (COMMON, EXOTIC, MINIMUM, NONE, UNCOMMON)\r\nTypographicCase
    (CAPS, CAPS_AND_SMALL_CAPS, DEFAULT, LOWERCASE, SMALL_CAPS, TITLE, UPPERCASE)\r\n\r\nSome
    properties are easy to map to specific OpenType features, but not all. I also
    suspect that there's more OT support than these items make believe, since FP10
    has complex script support after all. Some supported features are likely on by
    default under the hood.\r\n\r\nThe examples provided in the classes ElementFormat,
    TextBlock and TextLine are quite interesting as well."

  body: "> <em>Does this enable online type testers to have the functionality of the
    FontLab preview window?</em>\r\n\r\nYes, I believe so. However, I don't think
    the API will allow you the level of granularity to turn on/off every single feature,
    like the FontLab Preview does. Remember, the API is supposed to give you access
    to the functionalities of the text engine, not to the functionalities of the font
    itself. You get to the font's functionalities indirectly through the text engine.\r\n\r\nFor
    those who can't wait to start developing content for FP10 Beta, [[http://theflashblog.com/|Lee
    Brimelow]] has put together a videocast that explains it all very well: [[http://www.gotoandlearn.com/player.php?id=73|Flash
    Player 10 Beta: Getting Started - This tutorial shows you how to get started with
    creating content for Flash Player 10]]\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to see something
    happening right on your browser, [[http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/|install
    the Beta from the labs]], [[http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/demos/|go
    to the Demos page]], and click on the \"New Text Engine\" button. There you'll
    be able to interact with the 2-column text layout, and download the source code,
    like so,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fp10beta_6228.png]"

    you may need to redesign fonts' feature logic to create exciting \"exotic\", \"minimum\",
    \"uncommon\" ligature behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;:D\r\nUnfortunately, the API documentation
    doesn't say which features are actually linked to which options.\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nKarsten"

  body: Or, maybe not. I just downloaded the Fireworks CS4 Beta. The text tools appear
    virtually identical to those in the previous version. No obvious way to enable
    contextual alternates or any other OT feature. Maybe is only works when you paste
    something in from Illustrator or whatever... Hmm. Paste a text block in from Illustrator,
    and suddenly the contextual alternates are working, even when I change to a different
    font. Make a new text block, and it's back to pre-OT text handling. Kind of lame,
    but better than no support at all, I guess.

    You can, however, edit that text to your heart's content (including changing font,
    size, etc.), so one can imagine making what is essentially a style sheet of pasted
    Illustrator text blocks for use in Fireworks, implementing different features.\r\n\r\nNote
    that the ligature support is off in the public beta. It wasn't working quite right,
    so they turned it off rather than let you enjoy a nasty bug. One might reasonably
    guess it will be back in the final version, though of course I can make no promises.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

    classes on the Flash Player 10 Beta are essentially low-level classes. Think of
    them as the building blocks. If so inclined, you can build a text editor on top
    of them, but I agree it's not a trivial task. You might want to wait for FP10's
    final release, which will likely have a more comprehensive framework."
