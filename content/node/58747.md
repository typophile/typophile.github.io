  body: "I'm interested to know what this one is. The most similar I found based on
    these letters was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/eidetic-neo/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D34%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DCiencia.%2520Inovacao%25202010%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D26|Eidetic
    Neo]]. I searched mainly keying on the C and a, using my [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    ID Guide]]. If there were more letters the search may have been more fruitful,
    but I tried every 'a' that might have been roughly similar. Other fonts that were
    close structurally, but not as similar by eyeball, were Fiona Serif, Rebecca Samuels
    and Veljovic.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: That "n" is slightly clunky. Could this be a custom-designed logo?

  body: "I downloaded the pdf from http://www.poci2010.mctes.pt/info_publicidade/downloads/
    and looked  at it with Inkscape. Letters come in two layers. Here I separated
    the layers for the \"c cedilla\" and made it clear that the cedilla was never
    merged into the \"c\". Is a normal font likely to have such a free cedilla?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ccedilla_4650.jpg]"

  body: The whole thing looks rather lame to me. The /1/ especially needs a bigger
    head serif. My conclusion would be that the designer had to create the /ccedilla/
    from the /c/ and the /cedilla/ because there wasn't a /ccedilla/ already in the
    font. To me this indicates a non-commercial font.
