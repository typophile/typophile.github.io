  quoted, and I was wondering if any US typophile could scan the article and post
  it or just type what I am quoted as saying, so I can see it? <BR> <BR>It will be
  a while till it lands in the uk. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>JIM <BR>===

  body: Hi Andy <BR> <BR>Thanks for checking it out. I think &#39;Design for the public
    good&#39; is the name of the article. I guess it must be the May/June issue, which
    I guess will be in the shops in the next week or so. <BR> <BR>Thanks again! <BR>

    the good ol&#39; public.&#34; <BR> <BR>Or the Communication Shizzarts article
    would be &#34;Dee zine to get y&#39;alls good on.&#34;

    <BR>That person should be able to email or fax you <BR>the article rather quickly.
