  size/leading would make in centimeters?\r\nDoes it change with each type or is it
  always the same?\r\n\r\nthanks in advance for your time :)"

  body: It will change with the type. Point size is just a relative measurement. There
    will be some relationship in size from font to font but not a precise one. Sometimes
    the difference can be huge. If you want to answer the question you have to choose
    a type & then measure. Why do you want to know? What is your purpose?

    of your own research - check the definitions of 'leading' and 'point'.\r\n"

  body: "Actually that was a little uncharitable, plus I disagree with Eben!\r\n\r\nIf
    you mean 10pt type on 11pt leading, your lines will be 11pt apart, and so 58 lines
    will be the same height whatever font you use; however, the amount of text which
    will fit on this number of lines will vary.\r\n"

    the font will also determine if such a\r\nfixed setting ends up looking right
    or wrong.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Elliot is right that it is theoretically possible to make different fonts
    take up the same amount of space by altering sizes & line space. Muy fancy.

  body: "The height of the block of text from ascender of the top line to descender
    of the bottom line will be 22.43cm (636pts)* the top line won't have any leading
    above it so it isn't 22.50cm (638pts). This is only pedantry and won't really
    affect a mark-up for text with such tight leading and the difference will only
    be tenths of a millimetre.\r\n\r\n*This figure is likely too high since the actual
    height of a font rarely takes up the full point size it is designated.\r\nTim"
