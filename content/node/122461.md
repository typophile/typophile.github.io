  the past few years and is finally posting.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly new to typography-
  finishing up my undergrad at the moment, and I'm having trouble learning about type
  on screen. I have a lot of questions, and was wondering if there are any books or
  articles on the subject that are worth their salt.\r\n\r\nTo be specific, I'm working
  on a magazine which will be released digitally, and potentially in print down the
  road. I'm trying to find an appropriate typeface for the body copy, but I'm beginning
  to see that my current methods of selection is a bit\u2026 young. Aesthetics aside
  at this point, where would you start if you were trying to find something intended
  to work well on screen? Is there a difference between type to be read on a desktop
  computer and type to be read on a tablet/phone?\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\n~Jordan"

  body: "\"Aesthetics aside \u2026\"\r\n\r\nNoooo! Aesthetics not aside! The display
    technology is finally mature enough that decisions about type on screen do not
    need to start by taking into account the weaknesses of the technology. Start by
    identifying a style or tone that you're looking for, as you would when designing
    in any other medium. Start, in other words, with the ideal. Then worry about making
    it work on screen.\r\n\r\nAnd to answer your second question \u2014 yes, the resolution
    on phones and tablets is typically higher than on computers, which is nice. But
    computers are catching up."
