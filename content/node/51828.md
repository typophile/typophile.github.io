    vendor and / or the maker of the font? It isn't easy to understand why you're
    shooting so wide on this one.\r\n\r\nThe answer: it depends.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "James: The answer's not as complicated or mysterious as you make it sound.
    Any foundry or vendor will be happy to take payment from one party and license
    the font to another. Designers/agencies do this all the time on behalf of their
    clients.\r\n\r\nFrank: The mechanics may differ a bit from vendor to vendor, so
    contact Fountain (or FontShop or MyFonts or...) and ask them how they handle these
    requests."

  body: The FontShop.com cart has separate contact info for the licensee for just
    that reason. Design firms license fonts on behalf of their clients all the time.
    In fact, they should be doing that more often to stay legal, instead of simply
    sending the fonts to their clients after they complete a job.
