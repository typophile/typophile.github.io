  body: "Digital alternative: [[http://bengoetting.com/fonts|Grandmaster Clash]]\r\n<blockquote>From
    what I can gather from internet searches (so take it with a grain of salt) there
    was a tee shirt shop in Brooklyn in the 70's and 80's where this typeface orginated.
    The legend goes that an Old English / Blackletter typeface was simplified enough
    so it could be cut out of felt letters and ironed on to shirts and jackets of
    many a rapper and b-boy crew. From Grandmaster Flash to the Rocksteady Crew, Biz
    Markee and Joe Strummer visiting on tour with the Clash. I couldn't find a digital
    version of this font anywhere so I decided to make one. With a focus on making
    similar replica shirts of that era - I didn't include much for extra characters
    but I did throw in some alternate Y's and T's based on different versions I've
    seen (Do you Like Big Audio Dynamite's \"Y\" or the version on Joe Strummmer'
    s \"C. City Rockers\" shirt?). Either way I hope you like the font.</blockquote>"
