  body: "Can't name it and really doubt this is a font as it, more a customization
    of an existing typeface. I guess you do pretty much the same from many wide/extended
    grotesk., pulling up/downwards some middle crossbars and reworking /R.\r\n2 alternatives
    in the same vein: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/abalda|Abalda]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hubertjocham/motora-sans|Motora

    body: "Wow thanks for all the suggestions! I actually think this is a font but
      I don't know if it's commercially available. It's used at the end of this video,
      and also on other materials that they have http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3csaIbOxXjw\r\n\r\nBut
      I'll go the custom way and modify one of the above for what I need. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "This is what was originally published by American Type Founders in 1934 as
    Thermotypes:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ThermoTypes1@ATF1934_3473.jpg]\r\nand\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ThermoTypes2@ATF1934_6497.jpg]\r\nThe
    mid-line is high in Thermotypes, but it is low in the sample image, except for
    F, which is high. There is a different W. But the flavor matches the image and
    the midlines and other differences are easy to edit.\r\nDon"
