		<div class="commentbody"> BTW, I forgot to tell this story: <BR> <BR>Excoffon worked for Fondrie Olive, the only main French rival of Deberny &amp; Peignot. Cassandre was finishing his Peignot for D&amp;P when Excoffon came to visit. Upon seeing Cassandre&#39;s drawings, Excoffon quickly took the first train back home and drew an imitation. And it was released &#42;before&#42; Peignot. Excoffon&#39;s imitation didn&#39;t adopt Cassandre&#39;s reformist efforts, however, so it actually sold better too... <BR> <BR>BTW, this incident was actually one of the main catalysts for the foundation of ATypI. <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Are you sure it was Peignot&#39;s refusal that triggered the suicide? I think D&amp;P was already committed to Peignot, and it was a later design of his &#40;IIRC something more Greek-lapidary, possibly his &#34;Metop&#34;?&#41; that was rejected by an unnamed German font house that did it. <BR> <BR>Anyway, Cassandre wasn&#39;t so distressed over just a simple case of font licensing. He was beside himself with grief because nobody took his alphabet reform efforts to heart, even taking his work, stripping out the reform, and selling it like hotcakes. &#40;BTW, in my case I&#39;m fortunate to be able to squarely blame you guys for being so tentative... :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Personal-use and possession laws vary from state to . . . Oh, wait a minute, we&#39;re talking about fonts here. Scratch that. <BR> <BR>Seriously though, Hrant is right about any copyright expiring. Setting aside the whole issue of whether typefaces are covered under U.S. law, the longest term of protection offered under U.S. copyright is 75 years. So anything older is in the public domain. Less than 75 years and you&#39;ll have to research. <BR> <BR>I would not consider digitizing images from the 1923 ATF book for personal use as pirating -- especially a design which is not currently available in any other way.  <BR> <BR>If you want to turn your scans into a useable font, then there&#39;s always Streamline and Fontographer. But, if you&#39;re thinking of trying to set a decent paragraph of text, then you&#39;re in for a bit of work to get the font really up to snuff. You won&#39;t get professional outlines from a tracing program. You won&#39;t get good spacing from an auto routine. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, if you just want to set a headline, then skip the font. Set your letters manually. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> There are a number of reputable foundries around today who sell tons of ATF revivals. ITC revived Blair, Font Bureau has a number of ATF-derived designs, and what have you. <BR> <BR>Reviving one for your own personal use is kosher inside the US. Selling it can be harder depending on the design. Proceed with caution. <BR> <BR>As for the technical question, which was &#40;I believe&#41; the original question, buy ScanFont fron FontLab. I digitized a whole character set &#40;in my case J.M. Fleischmann&#39;s Groote Canon Duits from 1748&#41; inside of a weekend. It&#39;s amazingly intelligent. And that one I did with the three-day demo version, which led me to then purchase the full version. Worth every penny! I use it in conjunction with FontLab, but you can also use it with the cheaper TypeTool. </div>
