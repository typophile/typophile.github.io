  body: "Thank you Jan ! I thought about Mercury which is indeed very close (especially
    in its Display version) but Farnham seems like a good choice too !\r\n\r\nBut
    neither Mercury nor Farnham is both sharp and delicate as Time Modern\u2026 In
    my opinion, another typeface which has this nice feature is Greta by Typotheque
    (http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_display) but it's way to expensive for
    me!\r\n\r\nDavid"
