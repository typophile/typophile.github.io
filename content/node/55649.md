body: "I'm in the marketing department of a large company, and we recently adopted
  a new logo. The logo is mostly text in a fairly obscure font. \r\n\r\nI deal with
  vendors who produce promotional items and non-standard communication pieces (logo
  in stitching, etc). \r\n\r\nEven though I'm sending them the logo in vector format,
  with the font outlined, I often get back proofs where they reset the type into whatever
  looks most similar to them. \r\n\r\nHow can I avoid this? What's the correct explanation
  to give to make sure they reproduce the logo exactly, and not try to mimic it? It
  seems obvious to me (after all, they wouldn't try to mimic an image-based logo,
  would they?), but this happens so often, that I must not be explaining it well.
  \r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.  "

    just decided it would be easier to recreate\r\nthe logo rather than asking me
    to save it down\r\nto his illustrator 5 version.\r\n\r\nI think the best way for
    something like this is\r\nto ring up your vendor and ask for the file\r\nspecs
    and what exactly is required for the\r\njob. Sometimes you need to investigate
    a bit\r\nmore than just sending a vector file.\r\n\r\nDifferent processes require
    different files.\r\nSome stitching companies prefer a tiff file\r\nto a vector
    file, because the software used\r\nfor stitching patterns works with pixel-based
    images.\r\nBut by saying that, an other stitching company\r\nmight be fine with
    your vector art.\r\n\r\nring and investigate...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Difficult task.\r\n\r\nYou may ask them the reason, but here are my two cents:
    they are doing this because it is easier for them (safer, faster or more convenient)
    to type the name of the company instead of placing an image.\r\n\r\nAnd what if
    you generate a font with only one glyph: your logo? Maybe it would be even easier
    for them to type only one letter and change the font.\r\n\r\nOf course, it may
    work only if your logo is supposed to be black and white. Otherwise, you may obtain
    the right logo, but wrong colors."

    my guess would be EPS, but best is to ask as agostini says.

  body: "Not to say this is the problem with this particular vendor (which sounds
    more like incompetence and/or negligence), but:\r\n\r\nThe software and drivers
    for many of these specialized output devices have rather antiquated format filters,
    or when updates are available they are too expensive to be purchased as often
    as a service provider would want. The software I use for a vinyl cutting plotter,
    for example, requires I downsample vector files to Illustrator 8 format for them
    to work properly. Other devices may have different needs, so press as hard as
    you can on the issue of file format compatibility, including version numbers where
    applicable. Ask them what software they use in their shop, again, down to version
    number and OS."

    send a pdf-file, pdf's are made to be multi platform, and have less problems with

  body: "Definitely think about the file type and software as previously stated, another
    idea is to send them the font as well!!! This gives no excuse as to the font used.
    I\u2019m surprised that they just based the thing together, when I was working
    with printers they were usually very sensitive to getting the result how we wanted,
    and usually supplying the font or a vector would sort most things. Definitely
    don\u2019t pay for sub standard work! Good Luck"

    our logo, we'd attach this corporate \"warning\": \r\n\r\nThe guidelines are as
    follows:\r\n1. The only acceptable presentation of ********* logo is as it\r\nappears
    here. Presentations with elements missing are not acceptable. Presentations that
    change the order of the elements are not acceptable.\r\n\r\n2. Wherever possible,
    The LOGO should appear in ****(your color: PMS\r\nXXXc), and the words *****(whatever)
    should appear in black, on a white or light-colored background. In grayscale presentations,
    the entire logo should be 100 percent black (do not present portions of the logo
    as grayscale). In reverse-out presentations (white text on a black background)
    the entire logo should be in white.\r\n\r\n3. Do not kern, stretch or compress
    the text, present it in alternate\r\ncolors, or in different typefaces. There
    is no acceptable or approved reason to vary our identity.\r\n\r\n4. The logo must
    be followed with a small (R) registered trademark\r\ndingbat, superscripted to
    the \"***\" in \"*******\".\r\n\r\nThese guidelines are non-negotiable. It is
    vitally important for us to use our logo in a unified manner, both for legal reasons
    (the protection of our trademark) and for cultural reasons (so people identify
    with one logo alone).\r\n\r\n"
