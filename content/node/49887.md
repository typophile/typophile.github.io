body: "I want to reverse the colors of the below logo.  I want the lettering to be
  white and the surrounding color to be that blue (well really, I want the surrounding
  color to be transparent, but the specific blue will do). I don\u2019t know if it
  can be done and I don\u2019t have a lot of money.  I\u2019ve tried to locate the
  exact font, but to no avail.  The \u201Ce\u201D and the \u201Cr\u201D are never
  correct.  Avant garde gothic pro book is the closest I\u2019ve been able to come.\r\n\r\nI
  understand that all you designers out there will rate this logo bad to poor.  Regardless,
  I'm stuck with it for the meantime. Sorry.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated,\r\n\r\nCameron\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6510.JPG]"
