  I realize this is tilted, but there must be a roman around...Thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CIRCUS_5168.jpg]"

  body: I would guess this was hand lettered. Compare the cap S's. Something that
    could fill the bill as a starting point would be Albertus Black or Flange Medium
    Italic. You would still have to oblique it and try to condense to match. Or just
    hire a guy with a big red nose to redraw it.

  body: Agree with previous comments, that this is definitely a hand lettered sample.  For
    something similar, another good alternative might be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/doncaster/|Doncaster]].
