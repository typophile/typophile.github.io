  (before the Fourth of July, nonetheless), but I'm hoping for some feedback anyway...\r\n\r\nI'd
  like to know if you think there's anything I can do to improve on this. The look
  and feel has been tweaked to what I'm looking for, but I'm too close to it now to
  see it the way you might.\r\n\r\nI'm really looking forward to your feedback!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRay\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fresh-start-logo_4935.png]"

    (inside) contour at the bottom of the bottom counter of /s/?\r\n\r\nThe fit otherwise
    is so tight, I wonder if you should bring the top of the first /s/ over towards
    the /h/ to help close that gap.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is raising the
    ascenders of the /t/s a little to help them hold their own against those of the
    /f/ and /h/.\r\n\r\nI also wonder if the stem of <em>f</em> should be thickened
    just a touch.\r\n\r\nYou have a really nice match of style and message here!"

- body: "Aside from the fact that there's nothing fresh about the phrase \"fresh start\"
    I'd say it's looking...well, fresh. Have you considered matching the extended
    descender of the h on the last t? Just for balance. It might work, but it might
    be too busy?\r\n\r\nI know you're trying to kern beautifully, but I think the
    'a' in 'start' needs the rest of it's serif. Or maybe just a little hint of it?
    If you don't want to add it, the r's stem needs to be a touch thinner/tapered
    to look less odd with a missing foot. "

  body: "^I think he meant the \"r\" in \"start.\" The missing left part of the serif
    threw me off completely, it definitely needs to be there.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think
    the logo looks a bit awkward. From afar, it looks like the \"f\" and \"h\" are
    randomly italicized, and the word \"fresh\" is visually way heavier than \"start.\"
    I would say maybe leave the \"f\" but remove the tail/swash from \"h.\" It's superfluous.\r\n\r\nIf
    you do want another swash element, consider doing a discretionary ligature on
    the \"st\" such as <a href=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3660/3296160390_bbe30797d5.jpg?v=0\"
    target=\"_blank\">here</a>."
