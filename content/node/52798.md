  typeface.\r\n\r\nIt seems like every foundry under the sun sells this face, and
  I get the feeling that I'm not getting something. Why are Adobe AND Monotype AND
  Linotype all selling it? Some sell it in small-cap variants with lining numerals,
  some don't.\r\n\r\nI'm a type lover but I'm sadly lacking in typographical history
  and knowledge of designers, etc. Can somebody please enlighten me as to what's going
  on here so I can make an informed choice about which foundry I should be buying
  from, and why?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Idan "

    computer is the best choice\u2026 You could contact him. Maybe he will quote you
    a special price\u2026\r\n\r\nPardon me for not understanding the difference between
    a bunch of bits and bytes sold by Linotype and an identical bunch sold by Adobe
    or Monotype. Though, when I think about it, the icons may be different . In which
    case I would go for Lintotype \u2014 their icons are awesome. (irony intended)\r\n\r\nMore
    OT: If I remember correctly at one moment in time Adobe and Linotype made a deal
    and crosslicenced their fonts (comprising the full extent of their collection
    at that time). A similar deal exists between Monotype and Adobe. And between Linotype
    and Monotype.\r\nThese deals were amalgamated when Linotype\u2019s type business
    was bought by Monotype.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "Well, of course there are differences between the dozens of Caecilia fonts
    floating around: in terms of format, character set, <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/33667\">EULA</a>,
    support, and price (and, most likely, also the designer\u2019s royalties cut).\r\n\r\nAnd
    yes, finding out who is offering what can be difficult. For example, <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/searchresult?q=pmn%20caecilia\">linotype.com</a>
    states that PMN Caecilia is a \u2018Linotype Original\u2019, with \u2018Digital
    data from: Adobe\u2019. Probably those in-house terms do not represent a contradiction
    themselves, but sometimes things are hard to follow from outside.\r\n\r\nIdan,\r\nyou\u2019ll
    need to find out what version suits you the best: there\u2019s an OpenType Standard
    version (with smallcaps, old-style figures, and support for most western languages).
    Then there\u2019s an OT Pro, which additionally has the characters that are necessary
    for languages like Maltese, Catalan and Gaelic. And there\u2019s even an OT Com,
    which enables you setting even more languages (Central European languages and
    Turkish, among them). Or, maybe you are forced to go with a legacy format, due
    to some software limitation? That\u2019d be a pity, as you\u2019d have to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/482118456/in/set-72157601935111482/\">handle
    multiple font files</a> for smallcaps and osf, let alone for language support.\r\nF"

    just in metrics, but as Jan suggests, in character shapes too. Although in the
    case of Utopia, it was an Adobe font first, so maybe the adjustments were in reverse
    in that case.\r\n\r\nIdan \u2014 Florian has the best answer for you."

    :)\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a standard opentype version. I don't really need Cyrillic
    glyphs and I'd be using the fonts from within Illustrator CS3, so no legacy issues.
    I would like to have both old-style and lining numerals as well as smallcaps,
    but not \"at any cost\".\r\n\r\nI guess I need to do some more homework, but you've
    given me a little more tools with which to dig. Thanks again!\r\n\r\n-I"

    to date. The \u2018Central European\u2019 (CE) that most font vendors refer to
    rather stands for accented Latin characters/diacritics (see <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/International?cblock=ce#ce\">CE
