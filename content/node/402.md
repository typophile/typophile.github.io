    Unfortunately, I have not signed up for any of the workshops since I&#39;m broke
    as a joke having just graduated college with no real job prospects. <BR> <BR>As
    far as antiquarian bookstores go, I&#39;m not the greatest person to ask, but
    I do know of a few.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a store downtown on Nicolet Mall &#40;pronounced
    NICK-eh-let, don&#39;t ask why&#41; called James and Mary Laurie booksellers.
    I haven&#39;t perused their book selection, but they have a huge basement full
    of classical and jazz records. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s another large store equidistant
    from the two downtowns on University ave called Midway Used and Rare Books. <a
    href="http://www.midwaybook.com/">Here&#39;s their website</a> so you can check
    it out in advance. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps.

    the somewhat vague information on admission fees. Is there just a one-time registration

    daily? I know workshops are seperate and cost money, but I need to know how much
    I&#39;m going to be dishing out.  <BR> <BR>ALSO, if anyone is not aware, I will
    probably be the youngest attendee &#40;If I make it there&#41;. I appear 21 but

    of any financial corners that can be cut &#40;i.e. volunteering for admisson,
    kerning fonts, whoring a foundry, etc.&#41;? I approached Tamye with some suggestions

    additional charges except for optional workshops. <BR> <BR>We had plenty of volunteer
    positions available earlier, but all those spots are filled. Sadly, we have no
    fonts to kern. I don&#39;t know about &#34;whoring&#34; a foundry - you&#39;ll
    have to approach the individual companies and see what kind of response you get.
    Using slightly different terminology would be more likely to produce positive
    results. <BR> <BR>FYI, the first email I&#39;ve ever received from you arrived
    late Thursday night. I replied to you yesterday afternoon before taking a few
    hours off to see the fireworks with my little boy. Shocking, I know ;&#41; <BR>
    <BR>If you&#39;re going to TypeCon, be sure and register by Tuesday - it&#39;s
    only $125 for 3 days of typographic goodness, and some free munchies for starving
    type-aholics like yourself. After Tuesday, late registration is $200. <BR> <BR>

    be sure, but from the pictures and reviews it seems like it&#39;s the most casual
    conference out there. So probably wear whatever you enjoy wearing! But whatever
    you do, don&#39;t wear what Don Hosek was wearing in &#39;98: a three-piece pin-striped
    suit... Bejeezus. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
