body: 'I''m looking for an example contract for the initial design of a quarterly
  magazine. I''ve searched online but cannot find a contract specific enough in regards
  to preventing the potential fires that I so often hear about in this line of work.
  Does anyone have any experience with this that they would care to share? '

  body: "Are you looking for just a general \"design work\" type of contract? Or one
    specifically tailored for magazine design and layout?\r\n\r\nThe most important
    thing in any contract is to set reasonable limits (what you are or aren't going
    to do) and to make sure to get at least 1/3rd the payment up front (if not 1/2).\r\n\r\nGetting
    the payment up-front ensures that both parties have a vested interest in making
    sure the project is completed and completed to the specifications laid out in
    the contract.\r\n\r\nAnd if you really want a good contract that will survive
    scrutiny under the law, make sure to work with a lawyer.\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents."

  body: "Good point about the reasonable limits. Part of the problem is it isn't a
    straight one off job. I am quoting as the AD. I'll also be managing designers
    hired for ad creation. So the job kind of grows and I'm not sure how to approach
    it.\r\n"

    out to the local AIGA for a recommendation. You\u2019re in San Francisco; there
    must be at least a dozen lawyers who can tweak a stock contract to fit your situation."
