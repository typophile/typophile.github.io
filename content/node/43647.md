body: I'm almost done with a font I created and I want to sell it but I'm not sure
  how to write a license. Is there a standard template where I can just replace some
  words or do I need to create one from scratch? If so, what should I cover in the
  license?

    via MyFonts (or another reseller) will they a. help you write a sensible EULA,
    b. review your EULA for unrealistic clauses? A question for the John Collins next
    week, maybe?"

    EULA wonderful. It addresses all the concerns I know of in book publishing. The
    only caveat is there may be other user applications I don't know about.\r\n\r\nI
    thought <cite>touch\xE9</cite> meant \"touch\". As in \"you touched me with your

    a human can read it first and foremost hopefully avoiding the court thing to begin
    with. ;o)"

  body: "I think I understand what James is saying. Sometimes too much simplicity
    is not enough coverage. \r\n\r\nThey have to keep their bottoms covered. We, the
    end user, cannot blame them for wanting that. EULAs like Village's are wonderful
    for us, but we can't count on that every time. That is why it is absolutely essential
    to not only read the EULA when you license a typeface. Don't be afraid to ask
    questions of the foundry. If the foundry doesn't care enough to answer you, or
    if they do and you don't like the answer, then don't license from them."

    customer with the money, try writing the EULA in a way that a) will encourage
    them to actually read it and b) make it easy to understand.\r\n\r\nI agree that
    one still needs a lawyer, but lawyers tend to write for other lawyers. Make sure
    the lawyer you hire is also able to write for humans. ;o)"

    willing to let us share his notes with the community. \r\n"
