  body: "The problem is, even if you think you've seen it before (I think I've seen
    it), there are soooo many hand-fonts from soooo many sources on the internet now,
    that it is daunting to even think about looking for it.\r\n\r\nHere's a bunch:\r\nhttp://www.fontgarden.com/gallery/a.html\r\n\r\nHere's
    some more:\r\nhttp://www.kevinandamanda.com/scrapbook/fonts/fontsforpeas/\r\n\r\nAnd
    that doesn't even scratch the surface. It is almost a national pastime to have
    your handwriting made into a font. I even did it once at a <strong>[[http://www.fontifier.com/|website
    that does it automatically]]</strong>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fphand_3579.jpg]"
