  new type of evil]]\u201D by Ivor Tossell in the Toronto <cite>Globe and Mail</cite>
  discusses \u2013 what else? \u2013 Comic Sans, but with impressive verve and concision.
  Now, <em>this</em> is newspaper writing.\r\n\r\n\u201C[T]oday it's all but the official
  font of birthday invitations and poorly-punctuated passive-aggressive notes.\u201D"

    that as a trend, Comic Sans hating (and discussion thereof) is not exactly fresh.\r\nCanada's
    other national paper, <em>The National Post,</em> covered it many years ago. But
    perhaps that was not so well written.\r\nhttp://www.bancomicsans.com/nationalpostinterview.html\r\n"

    news... Which is kind of nice, because I know folks who look surprised when you
    tell them there are people who design typefaces.\r\n\r\n... and isn't Ivor Tossell
    Penny Pincher's nom de plume?\r\n\r\n"
