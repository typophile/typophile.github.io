body: "Bitmaps are used to describe graphics on computers. They consist of a grid
  of colored squares. Each of these squares is called a [[Pixel]] from 'picture element'.
  The simplest bitmaps consist of pixels that are either black or white. Bitmap graphics
  are also called [[Raster]] graphics.\r\n\r\nA bitmap font is a font comprised of
  characters rendered with bitmaps. While most bitmap fonts are designed with black
  and white pixels, some contain grey pixels or are full color. Full color bitmap
  fonts are also called [[Photofonts]]. The application [[Bitfonter]] is designed
  specifically for authoring bitmap fonts."
