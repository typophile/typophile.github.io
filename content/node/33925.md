body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/swell-font_5830.png]\r\nDoes anyone know
  what this font is? A while ago, I'd gotten it ID'd, but I lost the reference. I
  believe it was a Commercial font, and for some reason I think the word \"paint\"
  is in the name, but all my searches in the past month or so have turned up nil.
  I've found SIMILAR fonts, but I'd really like to know what this one is.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can help ID it, I'd really appreciate it!"

    They're not script though. Hope it can help maybe."

  body: At first I thought maybe the capitals (S and H) were from a different font,
    but I realized that the "tail" at the end of the S (which has a bit of a serif-like
    shape on it) is also present on the lowercase w. Likewise, the e flows right into
    the l, so I think it's all one font, rather than a mixed bunch. I *know* I've
    seen it before, I just can't remember the name. All the clues I could think of,
    I gave in the OP. I really hope someone recognizes it!

  body: "I doubt this is a regular commercial font -- this looks more like the work
    of an amateur to me. Maybe we should start looking on the freeware/shareware font
    sites.\r\n\r\nAn extensive search for upright connected scripts and in the Jukebox
    type collection, both conducted on the Veer website, revealed nothing."

  body: The only reason I believed it was commercial was because I'd asked for it
    to be ID'd on another site, which is now defunct. I'm pretty sure that on that
    site, someone ID'd it as some sort of commercial font with the word "paint" in
    the title. I went to the site, but didn't like the asking price, and promptly
    forgot about it. Now I'm much more willing to pay for it, if only I could find
    it!
