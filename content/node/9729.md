body: I was running through a new font i got, and noticed these forms. I&#39;m assuming
  they&#39;re the Ncommaaccent and the Rcommaaccent. Are these Legitimate forms for
  these characters? I honestly don&#39;t know... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/67219.gif"

  body: ahoi paul, <BR> <BR>i think the designer just forgot to shift the commaaccents
    below  <BR>the glyph, wich may originally were quoterights or something&#40;?&#41;.
    <BR>but this is only a guess, cause i don&#39;t know of those characters  <BR>shown,
    but i know of R- and Ncommaaccent &#40;wich are build like  <BR>the K- L- S- Tcommaaccent
    ones in your pic&#41;. <BR> <BR>cheers,  <BR>ute

  body: These are not legitimate forms. Cute though. <BR> <BR>There is only one instance
    in which the &#39;commaaccent&#39; normally appears above a letter, and that is
    the lowercase g -- where there is no room for the mark below the letter&#41; --,
    but in that case the accent is rotated 180 degrees. When we were making the Zapfino
    font for Apple, the first version to include Eastern European and Baltic character
    support, I adapted this practice to the uppercase G forms, which have a descending
    swash element that prevents placement of the accent below the letter.

    Any Latvian OS X users lurking hereabouts? I doubt if native readers would mind,
    because they already have a precedence for relocating and rotating the accent
    when it doesn&#39;t fit beneath the letter: all I did was to apply this practice
    to the uppercase as well as the lowercase: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/67261.gif"
