  body: "Thanks for trying. It's certainly in the ballpark, quite similar in many
    ways... I was very hopeful when I started looking at it... but in the end it's
    not it. \r\n\r\nThe G and A are quite different if you look carefully, as are
    the other letters, albeit more subtly.\r\n\r\nCan anyone else venture a guess
    or offer an idea as to what font this might be?\r\n\r\nAnd to the dedicated folks
    monitoring this forum: Please don't mark this query as answered. It isn't!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"
