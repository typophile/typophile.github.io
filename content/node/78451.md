  earlier this week, a new monogram story http://www.feltandwire.com/2011/01/25/monograms-a-la-modern/
  including our copper photo-engraved plates, hand cut, 1/2\" steel dies and sets
  of engraved monogram notes.\r\n\r\nhttp://feltandwireshop.com/products/engraved-monogrammed-notes\r\n\r\nOur
  copper-engraved monograms are created in Illustrator based on a rudimentary gridded
  template that had been converted by an engraver from the original pantograph Masterplate
  system that goes back to the 1930s.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Monograms_masterplate_templates_3828.gif]\r\n\r\nNotice
  that some of the monogram styles pictured in the (fuzzy\u2014sorry, hand held iPhone)
  photo above are the very styles in the letterpress types at the beginning of the
  article.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, ATF aggressively marketed
  engraved lettering styles to a new and potentially lucrative market: social stationery,
  which they had never marketed to before. So many of the social type styles we see
  today were originally engraved."
