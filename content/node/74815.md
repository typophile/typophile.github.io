  body: Plate 93 shows every letter except J. The caption does not indicate the source
    nor the form of the original letters. I am familiar with this particular alphabet
    because it is one I have considered digitizing, but I doubt that sales would justify
    the amount of effort required to redraw it completely by hand.
