    designed by you for them. \r\nSo do you work at Landor? Also did you made Precious
    Sans exclusively for Reliance or it was already designed? \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Satya,\r\n\r\nIt wasn't designed by me for Landor. I work for myself but
    do some jobs for various design companies; mainly logo refinements or the occasional
    custom typeface. This usually involves taking an idea that is in a rough form
    and working it up into something that looks professional - or A designer gives
    me a sow's ear and I make a silk purse out of it if I can :^), as was the case
    with the Reliance logo. Although it didn't quite work in this case - I think it
    looks a bit weak, and dare I say a bit tacky.\r\n\r\nI didn't make Precious Sans
    for Reliance, in fact I didn't know they were using it until this morning. And
    no, I haven't been asked to produce a Devangari style of it. I think it would
    be beyond my capabilities anyway.\r\n\r\nIs Reliance the Indian equivalent of
    British Telecom? (or whatever) - If so, I haven't noticed any increased licence
    royalties that one might expect for a company of that size. :^(\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNick
