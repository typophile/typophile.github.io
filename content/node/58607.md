    you'll use her a few times, and then some other font will come along and you will
    forget all about poor Nara."

  body: "No worries about Nara, she is no little teenager. She turned 20 this year.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a fact, and quite some story. Nara was designed as a student project of Andrej
    Kr\xE1tky at the Prague Academy in the late 1980s. As you can imagine, it wasn't
    very easy to digitise fonts back than, certainly not in communist Czechoslovakia.
    Andrej drew all letters 20cm large, and all points coordinates had to be measured
    on a milimeter paper, and [[http://www.typotheque.com/site/font_in_development.php?id=43|typed
    into]] METAFONT which than generated the outlines. He abandoned the project before
    Fontographer became available.\r\n\r\nFor the past 2-3 years I worked closely
    with Andrej and Nikola Djurek to complete the typeface, and now more than 20 years
    after first sketches were completed, we can present it to public.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
