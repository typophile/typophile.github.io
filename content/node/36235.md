  cheated</a>, but this time the computer's <em>NOT</em> coming with us. Sabine, the
  kids and I are off to the C\xF4te d'Azur. I'll be gone all week, starting from tomorrow
  Saturday, August 18 till Sunday, August 26th.\r\n\r\nAs usual, don't mind the mess
  during my absence, and in the event of an emergency (spam, abuse, unidentified typeface)
  please contact the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/user/103\">Stewfmeister</a>
  or one of the other moderators.\r\n\r\nNow that I mention it -- does everybody know
  who all the moderators are? Is there a need for a list or sumptin'? Maybe something
  to pick up when I'm back."

    be able to stay at my grandmother's apartment, so the main cost is the flight
    and the car rental (which still is a lot :^/)."

    In England they call that a busman's holiday. Maybe WE could call it a Typophile's
