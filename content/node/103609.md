  body: "<blockquote>Most associated by whom?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nGood question.\r\nI
    would say -to avoid explosion- two kinds of people: non-native type designers;
    and native readers.\r\n\r\nSo for example the former group might associate the
    ogonek with Polish because it's the hardest extra to make for that language, but
    maybe for Poles the stroke is more culturally significant?\r\n\r\nMore:\r\nHungarian
    = double acute\r\n? = ring\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hoping/intending to separate the diacritics from base letters, I would say
    that to me the circumflex is most strongly French, while the umlaut (diaeresis)
    is most strongly German. But that might have to do with an ignorance of smaller
    European languages during my youth. BTW I remember Asterix's \"La Grande Travers\xE9e\"
    where they ran into Danes, who were basically speaking French but with O/o replaced
    by \xD8/\xF8! Even their dog -a Great Dane, duh- barked \"W\xF8\xF8\xF8f\".  :-)\r\n\r\nI

  body: "If we're limiting ourselves to diacritics, the macron makes me think of modern
    representations of Classical Latin and Greek or in romanizations of languages
    like Japanese, and only then Latvian. Similarly, the breve makes me think first
    of the McCune-Reischauer romanization of Korean rather than Romanian or Vietnamese.
    So often I associate diacritics with cases where they would not have been used
    in the native orthography (Classical Latin originally would not have used macrons
    or breves).\r\n\r\nEven within a single language, diacritic use can be associated
    with particular variants, as in the issue of polytonic vs monotonic orthography
    in Greek. The former is associated with Katharevousa and the latter with Dimotiki,
    though not exclusively.\r\n\r\nFor me, diacritics are too small a unit to be associated
    with particular languages. Once you have a base letter, you can go further. Others
    here have associated the ring with Swedish based on \xE5 (though that would also
    work for Norwegian or Danish), but once you put the ring on a u to get \u016F,
    it screams Czech. Even without diacritics, digraphs and trigraphs and n-grams
    of increasing lengths are much more closely associated with particular languages.
    For example, wh is English, gy is Hungarian, tsch is German, and so forth."

  body: "For some bizarre reason, an o-double acute seemed to be translated into o-tilde
    when I was typing it in. Maybe if I had posted it, it would have displayed correctly.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Swedish-language education being compulsory in Finland, I can see that many
    people would campaign against devoting a significant fraction of the school year
    to learning a language of purely local interest. In Continental Europe, of course,
    second language learning does loom large; but I would have thought that if another
    language besides English were taught, the next choice would be French or German.\r\n\r\nLearning
    a language is an enormous investment in time and effort, so I see no reason to
    apologize for the fact that such choices will be made on the basis of raw economic
    and political power rather than other criteria."

  body: I don't want to get too much into the politics of Swedish-language education
    in Finland, but do note that Swedish is co-official with Finnish in Finland and
    there is a minority in Finland for whom Swedish is the mother tongue. The poem
    that became the national anthem was originally composed in Swedish. So it's a
    bit as if all Canadians were forced to learn French (if we leave aside the fact
    that French is spoken outside of North America as well).
