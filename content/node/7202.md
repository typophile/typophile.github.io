  body: I think they still use Hoefler&#39;s Mercury Text as their text font. I wish
    H&amp;FJ would release this one to the public already.

  body: I think they might use Big Caslon for some of the feature heds...and they
    also use Sabon in places &#40;I heard once from someone who used to work there...&#41;.

  body: BJ, you&#39;re right about Crank 8. Who&#39;d have thought it would work as
    a text face? <BR> <BR>Jana, I think you&#39;re a few redesigns behind, or thinking
    of another version of Esquire &#40;UK, perhaps?&#41;. The U.S. version uses serifs
    for display rather sparingly, but when they do it&#39;s a lovely cut of Mercury
    designed for that purpose. <BR> <BR>They also seem to have adoped GQ&#39;s strategy
    of rotating in a new display face every few issues. The September issue added
    a geometric slab-serif to the mix, mainly in the feature well. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/51597.jpg"
    alt="esquire_slab.jpg"> <BR> <BR>Anyone care to ID this one? It looks like a destencilized
    version of FF Container or WaterTower.
