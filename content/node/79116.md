  I've checked the answered type IDs and didn't find anything on their current typeface
  (in use since 2010, probably).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nTim"

    (\u201Cecal\u201D) (www.maximage.biz)\r\nBut the fun fact is that they were asked
    by urban outfitters to do some work for them.\r\nSo it sounds like it is just
    a knock-off of their typeface... classy"
