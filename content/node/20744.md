body: "I recently took over this website, and somehow an advertising company got ahold
  of the domain before it got transfered to me so I have to change the name now, but
  I'd like to keep the typeface the same. Any ideas what this is?\r\n\r\nIf it's too
  difficult I can email the original designer but he is a busy man with an extremely
  long email-response time.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJoshua"
