  body: "Hello.\r\n\r\nI doubt you'll get much interest from your post as this question
    has been asked lots of times within these forums... by students and professionals
    alike. It might pay to do a search within the forums and maybe get a few books
    on the subject of which there are loads! The typographic grid or the grid within
    design as you mention, is a massive subject... so it would be hard to pin down
    the right information for you. \r\n\r\nBy the way, what do you mean by the 'conventional'
    grid?\r\n\r\n--\r\nRez +"

  body: Using a grid doesn't mean accepting boundaries. Imagine music without a scale
    or time signature. It can happen, but it isn't what people look for. Even if you
    want something to sit off the grid you need to impose a grid structure so you
    know what you are not aiming for. How you use the grid says much about how you
    imagine your work fitting historically. So to address your question there is no
    standard use. Even in a craft with structure the individual voice of the craftsperson
    is clear.

    from the 1990s about grids and deconstruction and see what you find.

  body: 'I''ve always thought the best place to start, after knowing and understanding
    the information you have to work with, is to find a foundation, or grid, for it.
    I don''t force the information to fit that grid. Sometimes the grid changes to
    suit the information and that is at it should be. '
