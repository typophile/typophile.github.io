  posters and for years I've wanted to create my own versions for some of the movies
  I liked! But as the trend of making personal movie posters on the Internet became
  pretty big and it felt like almost everyone was doing it, I tried to find a way
  to still do it in an original way, and make them even more personal. So, the idea
  was to take some old photos from my family's photo-albums, and then turn them into
  movie posters by adding the type and making minor changes on the photos.\r\n\r\nThe
  hardest part is to finding appropriate photo for a certain movie (or vice versa),
  so I dig through a lot of photo-albums. :) The project is still ongoing, and I'll

  would love to hear your comments! "
