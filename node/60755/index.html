<p>The positive responses are still overwhelming me every day. Of course I did hope for people to embrace Calluna, but for a fairly classical looking text typeface I didn&rsquo;t expect this. As for sales&hellip; it&rsquo;s selling well enough, but not like Museo (Sans). However the regular has already been downloaded lots of times from MyFonts and you never know how many people will come back for an italic or a bold :)</p>

The International Herald Tribune, in contrast, thought <a href="http://www.032c.de/">this work</a> was worth being awarded the ‘Best Magazine of the World’ in 2007. Bit of a stretch? This is was Meiré thinks about it:</p>
<p>“If every magazine or every building or every brand or everybody tries to look appealing by using the same idea of being modern, it becomes interesting to go in the opposite direction, because life has different kinds of beauty to present. If people feel confused by it, it is because we are all so used to this kind of efficient, streamlined, correctness.”
“I am always interested in the concept of evolution = harmony/break/harmony …”</p>

But this kind of <em>provocation</em> merely reminds me of the early days of desktop publishing when having a mac with pagemaker made you a designer. Kings and Queens have been taken to the chopping block. Why not capital punishment for Mike Meiré?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Haus Der Kunst article is a discussion between Rem Koolhaas and Jaqcues Herzog. The debate is complex and I found it uncomfortable and challenging. That article is certainly not about empirical ideas of beauty – so why look at the magazine design in such terms? Have you read the article Nick?</p>
<p>As I recall I also found the Creative Review article a touch misleading by grouping together various non conformist platforms suggesting they were of the same origin.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think <em>ugly=statement=alternative sums</em> it up at all.</p>

<p>But then I&rsquo;m a type designer who spends hundreds of hours trying to create beauty, so it goes without saying that this goes against everything I stand for. After having spent so much time getting glyphs to look proportionally just right, then for some jumped-up motherfucker to come along and receive heaps of praise for bastardizing the shit out of it is particularly galling for most people who design type.</p>
<p>Besides I remember it from the first time round, which wasn&rsquo;t that long ago, and it was bad then. So to my mind it&rsquo;s just a lazy rehash.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it is on line but the article by Heller &ldquo;The Cult of Ugly&rdquo; (Eye Magazine) pretty much sums it up. You will get a kick out of it. Especially when G. Swanson gets into the thick of it and starts calling it a visual Tourettes Syndrome  and design for design&rsquo;s sake that seems to say FU without really meaning it!</p>

I&rsquo;d like to think I was a type designer too (yet to qualify really), but I don&rsquo;t let that inhibit my appreciation of this approach. I wanted to know what you thought about the <em>article</em> Built Ideology. As I recall the article is a discussion of how to rehabilitate a fascist monument. They don&rsquo;t tear it down, or tear down those who want to tear it down. They get beyond that kind of binary discussion. Any chance of that happening here?</p>
<p>Now you are all lying on my couch, what are you so afraid of?</p>
<p>The New Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes? The New Clothes of the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic?</p>
<p><em>It has no artistic, aesthetic or creative merit whatsoever.</em>
I think I read somewhere that it took MM a long time to get the right stretch, an amount that he was happy with.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m off to beat up some funny looking different people, then to the chip shop for a sh*g and some Michael Jackson flavoured news.</p>

<p>A story by Hans Christian Andersen. An emperor hires two tailors who promise to make him a set of remarkable new clothes that will be invisible to anyone who is either incompetent or stupid. When the emperor goes to see his new clothes, he sees nothing at all — for the tailors are swindlers and there aren&rsquo;t any clothes. Afraid of being judged incompetent or stupid, the emperor pretends to be delighted with the new clothes and “wears” them in a grand parade through the town. Everyone else also pretends to see them, until a child yells out, “He hasn&rsquo;t got any clothes on!”</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I know the story. I was trying to think of some way of advancing the allegory, hence <em>The New Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes</em>. There is a double edged quality to the original tale that can make the person who invokes it a slave to it&rsquo;s logic. The Emperor is foolish because he is afraid. However people often call on the tale to besmirch things they are afraid of. They express the same rash quality as the Emperor, only it&rsquo;s inverted. The rush to accept things is easily exchanged for the rush to reject them.</p>
<p>I will come back to your original comment <em>It has no artistic, aesthetic or creative merit whatsoever.</em> and link it to proof of my concept and also the subject of the article:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The inaugural exhibition was the Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung (&ldquo;Great German art exhibition&rdquo;), which was intended as an edifying contrast to the condemned modern art on display in the concurrent Entartete Kunst exhibition.&rsquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Andrew, I have explained previously that I do not like bastardized type. It is never the designers' intention for the type to be distorted in appearance, if it hasn&rsquo;t been designed intentionally I really hate horizontals that are thicker than vertical stems. Why take Helvetica (yawn) and horizontally scale it like that? - it just doesn&rsquo;t look good. Why not use Helvetica Condensed? Yeah, but that would be too uncreative wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>There are so many things that aren&rsquo;t crap. Right now we are living in a golden age of type design with so many wonderful beautiful designs out there.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something that I created a couple of days ago. It took me some time to design and artwork - I didn&rsquo;t just take something and mechanically scale it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I also agree we are in some sort of golden age, perhaps our definitions differ! I wasn&rsquo;t questioning your ability when I asked to see something that wasn&rsquo;t <em>crap</em>, it could have been anything.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the aim of the modification is to look good, at least not in the way that your work looks good or Michael&rsquo;s work looks good, and I&rsquo;m sure the designer is aware of this conceit – even if the type designer did not intend it, the art director did.</p>
<p>One definition of good is aesthetic, your own definition perhaps. Another way to define good might be appropriateness. As I said earlier I believe it is appropriate because it is uncomfortable and does not seek to pacify in the same way that some glossy magazines do. There is a deliberate tension there that has been – despite what you might think about the ease of the artworking – designed.</p>
<p>And on the mention of Helvetica, recently we have seen the &lsquo;The New Emperors New Clothes&rsquo; in action as Typophiles rushed to condemn it at the release of a film singing its praises.</p>

<p>Nick says he has read the magazine, have you Chris, and you Michael? What informs your judgement other than isolated typographic proofing? Just because it doesn&rsquo;t instantly convey something, that does&rsquo;nt mean that it doesn&rsquo;t bequeath something in due time, upon a prolonged consumption of the content. It&rsquo;s not a road sign – immediacy is not necessity. It doesn&rsquo;t present some instantaneous avenue for you to travel down in your small (but ultimately comfortable) automobile of stereotypes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we celebrate the seductive in the commercial; we disinter the commercial in the seductive. We illuminate an axis of raw sincerity and sexed-up realism… &quot; – From the issue in question</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we only ever learn something when some form we think of as foreign provokes us – and we resist. But sometimes, many times, in the middle of the resistance, we end up loving this thing that has provoked us.&rdquo; – Mark Wigley, moderator of the <em>Built Ideology</em> discussion</p>
<p>&ldquo;One option might be, as we have endeavoured, to find the old in the new, and the new in the old; to collide the banal with the sophisticated, the mainstream with the obscure. An agenda powered by an ultra-violent clashing of opposites… &quot;</p>

<p>I have closed more than one magazine after a few pages, when they were typographically bereft. And I also dislike the sterile sans ethos that pervades most magazines today. As I have said, the only thing that saves most of the publications are the pictures. At least they are creative and well done. The type, well&hellip; I feel like I am on Xanex (sp.) when I see it.
