  body: "I think this looks like <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=412583&grab_id=0&page_id=4739&query=Latin%20Wide\"
    target=\"new\">Latin Wide</a> with the right side of the J serif cropped off.
    \ Of course it's not wide here, so either it was carefully squooshed, or someone
    found a normal Latin. The R with the (almost) straight leg is unlike the other
    Latins I know. So I'd say this is a customized Latin, and if it was me I think
    I'd play around with Latin Wide.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
