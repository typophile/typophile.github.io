  so this post is based on a coin-toss.\r\n\r\nI'm not in a position to spend money
  on a wide range of applications, so my own testing of fonts tends to be restricted
  to InDesign and a small handful of other applications on OS X. I'm wondering if
  anyone has compiled into a single location (or a relatively small set of locations)
  information on which applications recognise/are compatible with different types
  of OT lookups.\r\n\r\nWhile information on which features are supported by different
  applications would be useful, what I'm most interested in is the types of lookups
  which are supported -- particularly those lookup types supported by the most recent
  version of Adobe FDK, but not earlier versions (and thus not FontLab Studio).\r\n\r\nVarious
  issues I am dealing with on a font I am currently working on would be greatly simplified
  if I could decompose accented characters in my 'ccmp' feature. Doing this will require
  investing some time in learning to work directly with FDK (which is giving me some
  headaches in my initial experimentation) rather than in FLS, and I'm not sure if
  this solution is worth pursuing at the moment if it will result in fonts which won't
  work in many existing applications.\r\n\r\nAny pointers would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
