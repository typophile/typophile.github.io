  tour right here in Boston today. Nope, I won't be there to see the kickoff, but

  target=\"new\">Cooper Black</a> takes front and center at the Stones' <a href=\"http://www.rollingstones.com/abiggerbang/\"
  traget=\"new\"><strong><em>A Bigger Bang</em></strong></a> media center.\r\n\r\nOddly
  enough, it looks like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bodoni/roman/testdrive.html?s=A+Bigger+Bang&p=48\"
  target=\"new\">Bodoni Roman</a> is being used on the video title... hairlines dropping
  away... just like the Stones themselves!\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nYes,
