  \r\n\r\nI'd like to use a font or fonts that have an association with the city,
  perhaps because the font was designed there, perhaps because the font says New York.
  \r\n\r\nIt must be a font suitable for a book that is available in roman, small
  caps and oldstyle/text figures. And maybe there is a sans serif that matches. \r\n\r\nThanks. "

    a little overused.

  body: I don't think you should obsess over the font's designer being from New York
    - we had a thread recently about fonts for a gay-themed book and the same topic
    came up. I think you should look for the font that best reflects what you're after
    even if the designer is from New Zealand. Maybe think in terms of something Deco
    for the display.

    I did note that earlier. But I think in the display realm is where you'd have
    more of a chance to give a New York City flavor if you wanted to. \r\n\r\nActually,
    <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Hightower\">Hightower</a>, also by Frere-Jones,
    is a text font that would perhaps go with Grand Central--though I think it doesn't
    say 'New York'. But neither does any other good text font. "

    is to use a type for the text designed by a current New York designer, but thus
    far have not come across one that both appeals to me and has an adequate character
    set.  Second preference is for a deceased New York designer, second because if
    someone is going to get paid for a typeface, it might as well be someone who can
    enjoy the money.  \r\n\r\nI am adamant about using a serif type for the text,
    quite prepared to consider a sans serif for titles and headings.\r\n\r\nEnjoyed
    the pinhole photos on your web site. \r\n\r\nI noticed the Bank of New York material.

    I sent an e-mail to Dutch Type Library asking whether I could arrange to see some
    of my text in one of their type faces. I am still waiting for a response, which
    is a bit surprising given their prices. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I sent Tiro
    an e-mail asking whether Plantagenet Novus is available and, if not, when it will
    be. \r\n\r\nNeither of these companies has acknowledged my enquiry, let alone
    responded. \r\n\r\nAs a matter of curiosity, is this normal?\r\n\r\nDoes Dutch
    Type Library, given its prices,really think that potential clients should wait

    that is fast to answer e-mails, that makes a type face that has a comprehensive
    character set and that has a \r\ngreat attitude when it comes to working with
    people who are interested in using its typeface.\r\n\r\nI'll know in the next
    couple of days, because of the co-operation of the designers, how the typeface
    looks with our material.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't work aesthetically, it won't cost
    me anything. If it does work, it will cost me quite a lot more than your standard
