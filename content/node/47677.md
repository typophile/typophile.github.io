    to think what could be the give away here. I'm thinking the 'd' in hydro could
    tell the story for some one who knows.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your input robbiefa!\r\n\r\n\r\nLuey"

  body: "wow getting close here! Fete would seem to be quite fitting, couple things
    don't match up. But of course its always hard when matching a face with heavy
    embellishment. Cheers dude!\r\n\r\nAs for emailing him, I might just do that!
    . . .  What's the worst that can happen :)\r\n\r\nLuey"
