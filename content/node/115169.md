  body: I prefer the Reyhan version because it looks more beautiful and also it's
    clearer where an ayeh is ended. In the Aziz version, the Ayat numbering is blended
    into the text and it's not obvious that we should stop at that point.

  body: Hiding could work as an indication for a full stop, but it I thought you wanted
    a comment on design of the ayat numbers glyph? Without this numbering, the reader
    couldn't find the ayeh which he is looking for. I don't agree with coloring though.

  body: "Glancing at this, it seems to me that the criticism of the Aziz is valid,
    but the Reyhan is a bit too small. Looking at images on the Web of copies of the
    Qur'an, it indeed appears that existing ones do tend to look like the Reyhan,
    but with significantly larger Ayat numbers than that example, although still smaller
    than the Aziz.\r\n\r\nI know I'm hardly qualified to comment on such a matter,
    but it seems like no benefit to the reader is gained by attempting to increase
    or decrease the size of Ayat numbers from current conventional practice to the
    extent shown.\r\n\r\nThis is a picture of a copy the Qur'an\r\n\r\n[[http://www.islamichappiness.com/quran.png]]\r\n\r\nsimilar
    to others I have found on the Web, so I presume the relative size of the Ayat
    numerals is conventional there."

    \ have a clear-cut answer to verse 7 of chapter 3 that ends with these lines:\r\n[
