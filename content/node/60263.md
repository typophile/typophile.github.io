  in our circle of friends I'm the \"artsy\" one.  Unfortunately for both of us, storyboarding
  animation has very little to do with the kind of typographic problems he's wrestling
  with.  I don't I was hoping one of the experts here might have some font suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe
  only guidelines I have is that he prefers the 'modern' look of sans-serif fonts,
  and (though it strikes me as a bit overused these days) he's very attached to the
  thick/thin concept.  This is something of a problem, since very few fonts I've been
  able to dig up offer a thick version heavy enough to balances the thin, but not
  so heavy that it completely dominates it.  \r\n\r\nAny ideas would be very welcome!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fonts_4943.png]"

  body: Maybe if the lighter font was black and the heavier one a medium-value color,
    the difference in density would be balanced.
