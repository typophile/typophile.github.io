  to the B of Bones. I know this lettering is hand-drawn and not actually a font,
  but could anyone help me find some fonts with a B like that?\r\n\r\nI've been trying
  to produce something like that but modifying Erato Light. If you want to take a
  look at it and give your opinion, click [[http://typophile.com/node/89442|here]].\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=2uei2dz\" target=\"_blank\"><img
