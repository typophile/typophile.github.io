    wondering why I don't mind this case of Latinization: Chinese culture isn't exactly
    under threat at the moment... Also, designers of oriental scripts do need to start
    thinking more freely (chiro-apologists need not apply).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Actually, they sort of acknowledge that by printing the entire Latin alphabet
    from that face. I guess the new glyphs are meant to be a direct expansion of the
    face."

  body: "I just asked my Chinese wife about this. She didn't think it was that successful.
    It was readable to her, but the blackletter style looked forced, something like
    the 'chop suey' styles look to us readers of latin scripts. \r\n\r\nThe 'Black
    Butler' thing is more successful. It's a fanciful extreme high contrast version
    of a woodcut style, so it's more rooted in the 'ductus' of Chinese characters,
    though as used by Japanese. The broad pen logic is so far from the pointed brush
    logic that I don't know if you can get from one to the other...  "
