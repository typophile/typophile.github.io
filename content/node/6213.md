  start a new thread. &#40;where&#39;s Hrant?&#41; So here&#39;s my question to all
  of you talented fontmakers and typographers. How do you do it? I&#39;ve read fontmaking
  tutorials but most of those are not useful and Fontographer is very vague and outdated.
  I build my characters in Illustrator, using guides and using the pen and pathfinder
  tools but I want to know if there are some tricks so that my characters are all
  the same height, and do you need to convert anchor points, etc. etc. Could someone
  else who works in Illustrator &#62; Fontographer please give me some insight. <BR>
  <BR>thank you. '

    Let me rephrase in the form of a question. <BR> <BR>What is one essential tip
    that you &#40;and all your colleagues&#41; can share to help some of the novices
    and neophytes who want to build a perfect font from scratch? This is a technical
    question that assumes a knowledge of type history, styles, etc. and focuses on
    nitty-gritty mechanics. <BR> <BR>Please, advanced typographers, drop in a tip
    and check it twice, and we&#39;ll find out who&#39;s naughty or nice. <BR> <BR>emerson '

    I would give is to open up <BR>fonts from highly-regarded designers, and: <BR>
    <BR>1. Don&#39;t copy the forms. <BR> <BR>2. Do try to deconstruct what they <BR>   were
    &#42;thinking&#42;, and learn from that. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll tell you the trick that actually made fontographer useful to
    me. When I am ready to export to illustrator &#40;see illustration&#41; I make
    a rectangular shim and place it directly on the left edge of the letter in question.
    The bottom of the shim rests on the descender height of the lowest descender,
    and the top on the ascender height of the highest. This way, all of the letters
    come in at exactly the right size and perfectly aligned. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s important
    that the shim not move up or down as you move it from letter to letter, as it
    will throw off your alignment. I also use the shim to set letterspacing, moving
    it a little to the left or right depending on the letter.  <BR> <BR>After pasting
    each letter simply delete the shim in fontographer. There may be a faster way
    to do this &#40;someone tell me if they know it&#41;, but this has worked best
    for me so far. <BR> <BR>Good luck, <BR> <BR>Christian Robertson

    of letters &#40;say, A-G, H-N, etc&#41; with your shim. <BR> <BR>It goes without
    saying, but it allows you to avoid frequent swapping between apps to get all your
    letterforms into Fog, saving some time.  <BR> <BR>jb '

  body: i was recently interduced to the &#34;CHANK&#34; method. <BR>i was doing something
    along the same lines before but i was going back and forth to Fon. and illustator,
    leter by letter. Follow the directions that christian posted above. it will open
    many doors for you!

    <BR> <BR>1. Save your file out as an earlier version &#40;ie. 3.0/3.2&#41; Illustrator
    EPS. <BR> <BR>2. Double-click the first character in Fog to pull up the character&#39;s

  body: ' This site is great. I&#39;m picking up little bits from all over. I wish
    there was a Fontographer tutorial put together by someone who actually puts out
    fonts on a regular basis. This would bring me glee. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on
    my first couple fonts via Illustrator and Fontographer. Illustrator 9 does not
    work with Fontogapher. Fontographer should get whipped with a wet noodle for neglecting
    their product. Is there an update planned? <BR> <BR>okay, to the nitty-gritty.
    Remember, I am a neophyte. I&#39;m trying to make the &#39;Great American Font&#39;
    It&#39;s a continuous reading font with serifs. I am not ready to post anything,
    but I will as soon as I get a few things figured out. <BR> <BR>How far under the
    baseline should a rounded letter go? I&#39;ve analyzed some fonts and some dip
    like 1/16 of an inch. <BR> <BR>What is the trick with kerming? There are advanced
    settings. The fontographer book is not a real-world guide. What do people actually
    do? What settings? <BR> <BR>How long should kerning a font take? &#40;hours, days,
    weeks?&#41; <BR> <BR>If a font is ever released to the general public, and it&#39;s
    a continuous-reading font, how important is hinting. I&#39;ve noticed that certain
    fonts that come with your computer are very big. They must have hinting. But other
    free fonts on the internet obviously have no hinting. They are small. <BR> <BR>How
    long is hinting supposed to take? &#40;Days, weeks, et cetera&#41; <BR> <BR>Any
    people who have actually made and released fonts or any of their colleagues, please
    post some information. You will make beginners like me happy. <BR> <BR>emerson '

    about em units. <BR> <BR>In a text face, projections of round parts &#40;and not
    just at the baseline&#41; should generally be around 15/1000 ems. Projections
    of pointed parts &#40;like the tip of the lc &#34;v&#34;, if it&#39;s not very
    flat&#41; should be a little more. <BR> <BR>BTW, looking at existing fonts is
    a great idea, as long as you&#39;re sure they&#39;re good &#40;choose stuff by
    Matthew Carter&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; How long should kerning a font take? <BR>
    <BR>It depends on your dedication level as well as the sensitivity of your users.
    For a basic Latin font, between a day and a week. BTW, avoid auto-kerning. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; how important is hinting. <BR> <BR>There are two kinds of hinting: <BR>1.
    For print: it&#39;s very important on laser printers, but not important on high-end
    offset printing &#40;like in a book&#41;. <BR>2. For screen: if you expect people
    to read the font on-screen &#40;as opposed to just typeset it&#41; then hinting
    &#40;specifically delta-hinting, which is a major pain&#41; is extremely important.
    But you can always make bitmap fonts instead - that&#39;s easier. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    How long is hinting supposed to take? <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t done huge amounts
    of hinting, <BR>but recently I hinted three somewhat similar TT fonts for screen
    rendering: the first one took almost three weeks &#40;major learning curve&#41;,
    the other two a little over a week each. Hinting for print is a lot easier, but
    still takes learning and time. <BR> <BR>&#62; please post some information <BR>
    <BR>Just one thing: don&#39;t expect too much help from experts, I&#39;m sad to
    say - they tend to be very protective; mid-range people are generally your best
    bet. <BR> <BR>hhp '
