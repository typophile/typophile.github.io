		<div class="commentbody">Carlos, you may generate more helpful discussion if you post this question on a site where it will be seen by a more varied community of graphic designers. The Typophile site is used primarily by designers who focus on type, and since this logo contains no type at all, our opinions may not be all that helpful to you.

For what it's worth, here's my opinion: I see a flame, but the flame is blue, so it's natural gas. Or education.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually it reminded me of the Methodist Church logo (without the cross).  But probably no one else would think that, they'd think something to do with energy or flames. But the symbol needs to be much bolder, it's being overwhelmed by the large blue circle behind it.

		<div class="commentbody">Being from Europe, your logo does not bring any immediate association. Please consider what happens when you greyscale it (photocopy): It appears flat and very much different than the original. IMHO, logos that does not retain their generic appearance after a common operation as the (B/W) photocopy defies its purpose.</div>

A friend of mine printed her business letterhead with just an embossed logo. Looked great, but then she realized the logo disappeared when photocopied or faxed!

But in general I think that how a logo looks in photocopies and faxes is less important that it used to be, with many companies using email, the web, etc for most of their communications. That's one reason we're now seeing more logos with things like color gradients that are obviously meant for full-color reproduction.

An important exception would be if the company often uses photocopies to reproduce business forms, fliers, etc before distributing them; in that case it would be very important. 

One option is to create a special black-and-white version of the logo for situations like that.

That's an odd question. The question should be "is this logo suitable for the client I made it for?"

That's really all that matters. </div>

It's actually not a bad way to test whether a logo matches the spec or not. If you designed something to reflect "eco" and it looks like a "toxic dump" to uninitiated public then that's a good red flag :)</div>

Here in the US, the Unitarian Universalist Association uses a chalice and flame as its logo (usually blue), though many American UUs don't describe themselves as Christians, insofar as they regard Jesus as a great teacher rather than the incarnation of the deity.</div>

It can also be used as a non-religious symbol, such as the Olympic torch (which had religious origins in ancient times but is secular now), and logos for many flame-related products (barbecues, etc).</div>
