  Neue Black and Edwardian Script.\r\n\r\nTo me, these two do not work well together
  at all. The previous designer has taken a rather clumsy route towards a 'feminine'
  feel.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a happier marriage between Edwardian Script and
  a sans serif?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nMark\r\n\r\nref: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-edwardian-script/"

  body: are you trying to keep with 'feminine,' or what direction are you going with
    this?

  body: why not just switch from the black weight to a ultralight weight? i'd think
    that you'd want to keep something fairly netral or else it will just clash with
    the elaborate script, IMO. (<a href="http://typophile.com/node/34033">speaking
    of neutral</a>, there's a new sans by that name by [[kai bernau]] ... not much
    of a change from helvetica though) or for some ideas, scan <a href="http://typophile.com/node/33690">this
    thread</a> for some current sanserif hits.
