  title=\"Increase Your Font Stacks With Font Matrix\">the fonts installed by default</a>
  in OS X and Windows systems and by applications like MS Office and Adobe Creative
  Suite. (Linux wasn\u2019t included.)\r\n\r\nI know from my own attempts to compile
  such lists that they are error-prone and incomplete, but this is a good addition
  to the list of lists. If you can\u2019t find a font you need for a general-interest
  Web site there, are you really trying? (Then again, you might go with Arial.)"

  body: "Thanks Joe. It's astonishing how hard it is to find definitive lists of what
    fonts are installed with which applications and operating systems.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I'd love to see as a next step with the matrix I compiled is a tool for automatically
    creating font stacks. For instance, type in \"Clarendon\" and it automatically
    spits out something like \"font-family: 'Clarendon Std', 'Century Old Style Std',
    'Century Schoolbook', Georgia, serif\"."
