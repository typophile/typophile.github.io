  still trying to decide what the visual identity of my small art company, which I've
  had since high school, should look like. I've bounced between numerous hand drawn
  logos and fonts but I've never felt certain about anything.\r\n\r\nAnyways, here's
  something I'm working on that seems to fit alright with me. I especially like how
  I can easily turn this into a stamp for biz cards and what not. \r\n\r\nThey are
  both Ziggurat but I've added cuts into the 2nd one. BTW - I'm trying to go for a
  playful industrious look that looks modern. "

    like how in the 2nd one, your added cuts make it a little more friendly.\r\n\r\nWhat
    if you tilted the \"O\" in Eggroll? (like an egg rolling? perhaps that is too
    much of a play on words? Not sure if it would fit with your company or not - but
    it might add a touch of something memorable).\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

    is an independent gig I've had since high school. The name comes from my nickname
    \"Eggroll\" that my friends gave me a long time ago b/c I'm half asian. I started
    the company with one of my friends silkscreening and airbrushing skateboards for
    a lot of people. Then, it evolved to silkscreening tees. Four years later, today,
    I'm still highly passionate about art but haven't really tried to sell anything.
    So, I'm designing and developing an online store (I also make websites), that
    will sell nearly everything I create. If people buy it, awesome, and if not I
    will still have a massive online portfolio. However, I'm trying to shift from
    freelance web design to just focusing on my art so the branding it pretty important
    to me. \r\n\r\nI tried out the tilted 'O' below. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/slabserifs-blue_3519.jpg]"

    you might have to loosen up the spacing there and a bit on the \"EG\" and \"OL\"
    pairs to even out the kerning.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "It's your logo so the debate between the true vector version and the hand
    drawn will probably have to be solved internally. \r\n\r\nI think you might try
    out different ways of making the logotype relate to your artist's handiwork. Perhaps
    show a version that keeps the original outlines but uses the rough ink typically
    seen in a lot of silkscreen (see image). http://www.birminghamprintmakers.org/images/silkScreen.jpg\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I thought the tilting of the O was a clever addition, but the space between the
    R and the O is really bothersome. I think you should try and create a ligature
    of the two letterforms to bridge that gap."

    work with a font. The silkscreening would be a good idea, however, I don't do
    any silkscreening in my main body of work. Mostly I do drawings and paintings.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    these are a couple of past attempts. As you can see I'm all over the place in
    terms of what it should look like. I liked the first one, but I couldn't get 'industries'
    to fit underneath 'eggroll' without the d hitting the 2 'g's'.\r\n\r\nI think
    I may have to go back to the drawing board on my logo...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/attempt_1_3851.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/attempt_2_5940.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/attempt_3_3958.jpg]"

    the name. The traced vector approach looks cool, though I am reminded of an ancient
    beer brewery or something\u2014but, regardless, it's strong and doesn't take itself
    too seriously. In your latest sketches, I really dig #3's \"R\" since it looks
    like a big grin, and the whole thing is simply imaginative.\r\n\r\nI think, if
    you're going to try a completely different direction, keep in mind your targeted
    audience. I don't think you should fuss too much about kerning or other concerns
    corporate identity work might need to address since this mark you're making is
    so personal."

    between the R and the O could be maximised if the O is lengthened to fit in that

    instead. \r\n\r\nI've roughed up a possible configuration (kufic square, ignore
    the hairline gaps, sorry) which you may want to sample after.. The blank/empty
