  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello typophiles,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a copy of that book but it seems it&rsquo;s out of print and rather hard to find - at a reasonable price, at least!
I was wondering if any of you might know where to get a new/good condition copy either in Canada or from a bookshop that ships to Canada (the cheaper the better, of course ;-)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If it hadn&rsquo;t been a present from my dad, I&rsquo;d give you my copy. It&rsquo;s too thoroughly riddled with errors for me to take it seriously. At least on my first half dozen tries I found I could open to any spread and find a half-truth or misleadingly incomplete statement. I actively recommend <em>not</em> reading or using this book.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>he talks about features specific to specific foundries' cuts of Baskerville, Bodoni and Caslon as if they were features of the broader typeface. To read this book you&rsquo;d think there was only one digital version of Caslon! (I know Adobe Caslon is the most common digital Caslon, but even Adobe sells a bunch of other Caslons.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there&rsquo;s dubious advice on bold and italic as formatting that clearly indicates that he&rsquo;s never used a Windows computer or dealt with cross-platform issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his comments on legibility cite Sir Cyril Burt. This is the guy whose studies on identical twins were found to use made up data. I&rsquo;m thinking I wouldn&rsquo;t cite Sir Cyril&rsquo;s work as evidence of anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>despite being published in 2004, and having lots of info specific to nearly-modern digital type, the writing is stuck in the 1990s. There&rsquo;s info on expert sets and supplemental fonts and inputting ligatures manually&hellip; and no mention of OpenType.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the page describing the prime and double-prime shows instead an opening quote and opening double-quote.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s not an exhaustive list. I just opened to a spread and looked until I found an error or omission, and then opened to another spread. I always found one.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say there isn&rsquo;t tons of good content in here as well. Clearly, he knows a lot about typography. It&rsquo;s just that I require a lower error rate and something that is more up to date to recommend it.</p>
<p>I see Amazon US has used copies for as low as $27 for the hardcover (oddly, the paperback is more expensive at $38.99). For some reason Amazon.ca&rsquo;s prices are rather more stratospheric.</p>
<p>By the way, the entire book is set in a neo-grotesque sans (Univers, perhaps?). Ugh. But I must say, if one is going to set a 159-page book in a neo-grotesque, the way he does it is the way to go: narrow ragged-right columns and adequate line spacing. However, in the body text the type size feels a bit tiny and anemic for the weight of the typeface, and the captions the bold weight causes the tiny neo-grot type to pretty much close up, noticeably harming legibility.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, thanks for your very frank(!) opinion :-)
I just saw that there&rsquo;s a copy at a university library not far from my place, so I might just take a closer look at it there.
I only browsed through the book some time ago and thought it looked interesting based on the illustrations.</div>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not just you, it&rsquo;s everybody. It&rsquo;s not enough to have good content, a good book has to have very little bad content. The reason is that the only way to separate the two is if you already know the material! :-/  The people who actually need a book need to be able to trust it first.</p>
<p>BTW, I have an unused copy of Jury&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letterpress: New applications for traditional skills&rdquo; (2006) if anybody is interested. Being mostly visual (and nicely composed actually) it can&rsquo;t be TOO error-prone&hellip;</p>

<p>Exactly my sentiment.</p>
