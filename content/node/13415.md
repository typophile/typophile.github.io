body: "I'm not sure if I posted this in the right spot. But since I'm not looking
  for a crit, seems good enough.\r\nI'm having a weight issue. My letters so far are
  very heavy in the curved axis' and the stems, but my thin strokes are quite thin
  in relation. \r\n\r\nIt almost seems somewhere in-between standard and bold. Would
  a bold have thicker thin strokes, and would standard have thinner axis/stems, while
  having a slight reduction in the thins?\r\n\r\nis Text face letter,\r\n\r\nTHX\r\n\r\n\r\n7.17.05\r\n\r\nOk,
  I just need somebody to look at this x. Just in the context of an x. I think it's
  close."

  body: If you are aiming for a bold I'd make the thin strokes thicker and lengthen
    the serifs slightly. If you're aiming for a semi-bold you might want to lighten
    the right side of character.

    a suggestion">this?</a> That is, if you are going for a text face. <a href="http://www.grodworks.com/temp/P.eps"
    title="eps format">eps</a> if you want it. I'll remove it soon, of course.

  body: I think, given the proportions that at text sizes the weight of the stem and
    bowl would be normal or just slightly dark, but the thin parts would simply be
    too thin to print properly. You should try a couple of letters together on a page
    to get a feel for how it will print. I think Noah's on the right track, but the
    thin parts are still too thin for text sizes.

    Look forward to a corrected L P R J , let me know if I'm on the right track, pretty
    sure I'm in the groove now. \r\n\r\n"

  body: New stuff. I'm either nuts or incompetent, because no matter how many times
    I check the squarness of my letters their always off, then I have to fix them,
    then after a little while, their off again. Arggg. Look above

  body: "Very nice. I have a few general suggestions. Don't worry <em>too</em> much
    about geometric perfection with pen and paper, you can easily correct it as you
    draw the glyph in fontlab. There is no need to finish the font on paper (unless
    that is how you prefer it) you have enough of the uppercase to draw the rest directly
    in fontlab with the pen tool. At least, that's how I do it, if you're more comfortable
    sketching it all on paper first than go for it. I really like what you did with
    the \"P\" at the base of the bowl where it joins the stem. It will be interesting
    to see if the digital version has any bracketing or if you intend to make is sharply
    squared off. The \"L\" seems a tad to wide for my tastes, but its hard to tell
    without seeing it in a setting. The \"F\" is great, it seems energized. You'll
    need to straighten it, of course, but don't touch those curves and corners! The
    \"K\" looks top heavy and a little wide. The \"J\" is fine, maybe take the left
    serif in a hair?\r\n\r\nI'm eager to see the lowercase.\r\n\r\nI hope someone
    with more experience than me chimes in, too. \r\n\r\nIt's looking very, very nice,
    keep it up!"

  body: Looks like an "X" sorry I can't offer more. It <em>may</em> be a little too
    wide on top and you <em>may</em> be overcompensating for that illusion where one
    line passing through another looks unaligned (I forget what it's called right
    now but its the reason the left leg and the right arm aren't really a straight
    line) <strong>but</strong> it is very hard to be certain of a lot of this stuff
    without seeing it in context and at it's optimal point size. There are more educated,
    experienced voices than mine who frequent these forums and I hope one of them
    will comment (hrant?).

  body: There needs multiple letters in a row to see how they look togeteher. Don't
    just replace images that way because it is impossible to critique! I forget where
    I read it but somebody said that a font is not a collection of beautiful letters
    but a beautiful collection of letters (or something to that effect).

    There is a right and wrong way to do every letter.
