    <BR> <BR>Thanks anyway folks. It&#39;s better to celebrate dead people rather
    than old people. You get to eat more cake. Goudy is having his birthday in several
    days, I think March 8. Did you know they are making a movie about him? <BR> <BR>

  body: Kenn, <BR> <BR>Boy that has a warm home sweet home sort of look.  Are you
    selling that font? <BR> <BR>My wife better not see it, she will start knitting
    me some socks. Does your wife knit you socks, or is it just a Finnish thing? I
    remember I was dying in the hospital and this Swedish nurse looked at me and said,
    &#34;You didn&#39;t&#34;. I asked, &#34;Didn&#39;t what?&#34;. She said, &#34;Get
    married to a Finnish woman.&#34; <BR> <BR>Anyway I have one busy day. This trip
    needs much planning. Something I am better at delegating than performing.

  body: Gerald, <BR> <BR>No I&#39;m not selling that font, but my local thrift store
    did last summer, quite cheap too, 65 Kroner is about 10 dollars.  <BR> <BR><img

    <BR>I kind of like these things. 1912 bitmaps... <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t have a wife
    and if I did she probably wouldn&#39;t. My mum did when I was a kid, she made
    mittens too, that was before thinsulate and all that so you&#39;d often lose a
    mitten attached to a snow ball...

    It was actually a very good/weird birthday, It started in Tokyo &#40;with Japanese
    waitresses singing in English over a fruit platter covered with candles&#41; and
    went on for almost 42 hours to end in L.A. That really makes you feel old   ;-&#41;'
