body: "Hi,\r\nFor this logotype I am hand-drawing the name. Face inspired by the typography
  of I\xF1igo Jerez's work for Suite and I guess Eric Olson's work at Process type
  foundry. I'm trying to achieve a fairly 'warm' character, still with few curves.
  Perhaps 'design engineered' would be the word. Since I have no previous experience
  of this kind of work, I'd be happy for any critique. Shoot."

  body: The width of your characters is inconsistant. The K needs to be wider to balance
    RET. The S doesn't work, the sharp angles aren't consistant with the rounded bowl
    of your R. This isn't a fail but it needs work. The letter spacing is good.

  body: "Thanks Dan.\r\nWhile I agree that the 'S' needs work, I'm quite keen on retaining
    the sharp-angled character. I'd be interested in hearing any suggestions in which
    direction I could take the 'R' to make the two characters more consistent. Regarding
    the widths, all characters apart from the 'T' are of equal width, which was an
    initial decision that related to the idea of 'engineered' - using a fixed grid.
    I will try making the 'K' wider though.\r\n\r\n"

  body: If you rework the R to reflect the S I'd be more confortable with the look.
    Try sharpening up those curves on the bowl. As for the width, remember optically
    characters look different even if they are the same mechanical width. Thats why
    the T and E look wider than some of the other characters. Experiment with making
    them a tiny bit narrower. Good work!

    Tried squaring curves on the 'R' but did not like the results. Perhaps I need
    to smooth those sharp angles on the 'S' after all?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ummocrono.com/krets_v2.gif\">view

  body: "Fredrik,\r\n\r\nYour new version is better, but the 'S' still feels to me
    like it's trying to free itself from 'KRET'. Try moving it closer by just a hair.\r\n\r\nGenerally,
    I think you need to lessen the visual differentiation between the 'S' and the
    other letters. In addition to the sharp angles and the downward-sloping of the
    center of the 'S', the 'R' has a generous bowl that lowers the perceived x-height
    (to me), whereas the 'S' has more typical proportions. This is amplifying the
    differences that make the 'S' the odd man out. Also, the finishing strokes at
    the top and the bottom don't seat the 'S' as firmly as the rest of the characters,
    and put its visual center of balance to the lower right (perhaps trim down the
    top stroke of the 'S' to make it lean back and balance itself a bit?). Try eliminating/minimizing
    some of these differences, which might allow you to keep the sharp angles. Or
    maybe it's just easier to get rid of them...\r\n\r\nOverall, nice work! I look
    forward to seeing the results."

  body: "Guys,\r\nsorry for not posting any progress, other things more urgent ...\r\nI
    have been trying various approaches of making the 'R' and 'S' feel more similar,
    while also trying to balance the 'S'. Moving the 'S' closer by a hair helps somewhat,
    but I find that the highest point on the curve has to be shifted in order to slip
    the 'S' back up into the word. There are two versions in the link below, one with
    the re-worked 'S', and another with a re-styled 'R'. I came across Auto by Underware
    and saw something I liked in the 'R'.\r\nComments would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n<a

  body: I love the new S but the new R needs work on the bowl. It seems to just drop,
    you need to make the sloop less dramatic and you've got something. I'm not a type
    designer so you might want to run it by some of the type pros here under San Serif.

  body: "Dan,\r\nthe new 'R' was a pretty quick fix - I just happened to see sth in
    Auto that I thought was interesting in the context as I had been trying ways of
    altering the shape of the bowl in the 'R'. I will do some more work on it and
    have it posted later on. Thanks."
