  body: Thank you for your reply! Sirenne is a bit alike, but I've found many that
    resemble it more or less. I'm trying to find something that is as close to the
    original as possible, the exact match would be perfect. I can't find any single
    font that has that type of long curvy serif like on letter "A". I doubt that it
    was his custom font since I've seen it on many paintings around that era. Out
    of the period, I guess that's gotta be some humanist serif type, but I've found
    nothing really close.

    an exact match (exact on which letters? They are all different). "

  body: "I think you need to recognize that when Perugino painted there were hardly
    any 'fonts', because movable type was still a novelty if it was available at all.
    His lettering was hand-drawn and probably based on Roman alphabets he had seen
    in use in Umbria, or whatever regions he traveled and studied in. I don't think
    I have seen a modern font that has all the attributes you are looking for. Goudy,
    who studied Roman inscriptions, designed the typeface [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-hadriano/|Hadriano]],
    which I think may come near the A you want.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thank you so much! Hadriano is the closest match so far, and I think I'm gonna
    stick with it! Thank you, once again! I guess you're right, it's unlikely that
    I'm gonna find the EXACT font, so I'll go with the closesnt one.
