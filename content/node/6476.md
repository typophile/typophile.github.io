  body: Rhonda, in order for us to help it would be best if you showed us an image
    of the type you want us to identify. That musical has been out a long time and
    there have been several designs used for the lettering for the show. Which one
    do you want ID&#39;ed?

  body: I think it&#39;s pretty obviously hand-lettered -- no two instances of the
    same letter &#40;E, A, C and R, for example&#41; are the same.  <BR> <BR>That
    said, the &#39;70s vibe and tiny serifs remind me of ITC Serif Gothic. <BR><a
