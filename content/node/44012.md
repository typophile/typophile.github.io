  seems very interested to me and I wonder if there is any case similar related to
  typography or design?\r\n\r\nIf you like to add something or comment about it that
  will be very welcome.\r\n\r\nAs to Bol\xE9ro, here is the link:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-4J5j74VPw\r\n\r\nCause
  there is no way you will create something without Music, to help.\r\nOr vice-versa.\r\n\r\nYou
  will say \"where is the type\", it is a \"PI\"\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
