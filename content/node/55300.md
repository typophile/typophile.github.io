  long right now to see anything, and thought it would be good with some fresh eyes...
  Thanks\r\n\r\nEDIT: And by the way, why does Adobe reader make the \"I\" and the
  straight bar in the \"K\" look to wide? "

    I love the placement of the slash, but I might make it a hair thicker.\r\n- Isn't
    this too light and airy to survive typical logo treatment?\r\n- Is the trap in
    the first \"N\" intentional?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    bow the top (like in the \"C\" and \"S\"). Look at something like Myriad for an
    example.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks alot.\r\n\r\n- Wow, I hadn't at all seen the trap in the first N,
    well spotted. Don't know how it got there, i'll just check if it's there in the
    other versions...\r\n- No, i have not inserted extra sapce between S and T\r\n-
    About the \"R\", then i find it too \"heavy\" when joined. And I find it to be
    a reference to the K.\r\n\r\nR "

    about something like these?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RRRR_4620.gif]\r\n\r\nIn
    fact if you go with the bowed top (like the two right ones) you should try making
    the \"E\"s also bowed, top & bottom! Like a \"C\" with a bar, or maybe the Tarzana
    form.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Howdy! I have played around with your type a bit and what I have changed
    boils down to this:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Changed the horizontal overshoot of the
    O.</li>\r\n<li>Added to the width of the slash character.</li>\r\n<li>Changed
    the ending of the Rs upper bowl to vertical as none of the other letters had a
    diagonal termination. I felt it would fit in better.</li>\r\n<li>Changed kerning
    between those pairs: HR RI ST EN NS EN.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nHope you like. ^^\r\n\r\nhttp://www.shockomotive.org/KC_mod.pdf\r\n\r\n"
