    tails.\r\nCheck also an older version <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Adobe&ffam=Times%20NR%20Seven%20MT%20Std%20-%20Regular&fid=eb01fc4d263f241198707d09080c865c&fsize=60&text=The%20Crisis%20of%20Values%20Giulio%20Carlo%20Argan&wrap=2|Times

  body: "I did not find Times NR Seven MT at Adobe or Myfonts, but Times New Roman\xAE
    Seven [TimesNRSevenMTStd.otf] is available from Fonts.com http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/times-new-roman/seven
    There is also Times New Roman\xAE Seven Bold [TimesNRSevenMTStd-Bold.otf]  http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/times-new-roman/seven-bold
    Both designed by Victor Lardent\r\nI observed some differences between the letter-forms
    in the regular and bold versions. Note for example that the bold has a spike at
    the bottom of the vertical stroke for b. Also that the contrast is more than the
    book title. Using the last title as a test:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TimesNRSevenMTStd-BoldInUse_5187.jpg]\r\nIt
    seems to me that the book title letters were made by applying a parallel line
    tool to make a thickened version of the regular version of Times NR Seven MT\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TimesNRSevenMTStdThickenedByParallelTool_5080.jpg]\r\nVoil\xE0,
    no significant difference between this and the book title. All that is needed
    is to adjust spacing.\r\nDon"

    explain about the parallel line tool?\r\nIs this the same as putting on a stroke
    in indesign?\r\nSorry if it is a dumb question, I am learning about these new
    things.\r\nThanks!\r\nT"

  body: "No problem, if you don't ask questions you won't get useful answers. \r\nI
    use a program called Fontlab to make and modify fonts. The parallel line tool
    is part of this program. \r\nI have not done this with Indesign so I can't say
    if they work the same. \r\nThe Fontlab parallel line tool looks at an existing
    outline and creates a new outline parallel to it with a distance from the existing
    outline that you specify when deploying the tool. The new outline can be on the
    outside of the existing outline, making a new larger outline and producing a glyph
    that looks thicker -- as I did for this font. Or it can be on the inside and produce
    a glyph that looks thinner. You can use parallel lines that are both inside and
    outside to produce rimmed fonts, like the ones you see on college athletic letters
    and numbers. You can also make outlines with a different distance for the horizontal
    and vertical strokes.\r\nUnfortunately Fontlab has a steep and long learning curve.
    \r\nI expect that you could do something similar with other font editors, such
    as FontForge -- a free open source program. It has extensive online help resources.\r\nGoogle
    will produce all the appropriate links for information on Fontlab and FontForge.\r\nFor
    discussions about font making and font modifications you might find it helpful
    to browse through the Typophile Build forum http://typophile.com/forum/6 I trust
    that persons active there could give you advice on these issues.\r\nDon"
