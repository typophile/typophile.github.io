body: "I'm looking for a font that looked like a transition between <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/hawaiian-aloha-btn/\">Hawaiian
  Aloha BTN</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/manosk/\">Manosk</a>.
  Sort of a tropical, cartoon and informal feel and somewhat distorted look. I have
  seen it on some headers on an old website around 1999 (now 404 and poorly archived
  on Archive.org), so the font is not newer that that. I do have found a blurry screenshot
  from TV show footage featuring it: <a href=\"http://youtu.be/yI-GHJ6YgGc?t=8m7s\">http://youtu.be/yI-GHJ6YgGc?t=8m7s</a>
  (it reads 'Cine' in red).\r\n\r\nEDIT: I found it. It was <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/gilligans-island.font\">\"Gilligan
  Island\"</a> (based on the logo of that show, I guess)."
