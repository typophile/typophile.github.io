  The fonts which we acquired were rendered with old software and need to be sized
  to better match today\u2019s base-14 fonts as well as smoothed. \r\n\r\nIf you or
  anyone you know of have the skills to do this and are available for hire please
  let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nBrent\r\nbrent@docudesk.com\r\n"

  body: "Hi Brent,\r\n\r\nPlease excuse me while I try to translate this into language
    easier for people on this list to understand.\r\n\r\nThe Base-14 fonts are Helvetica
    (normal, bold, italic, bold italic), Times (normal, bold, italic, bold italic),
    Courier (normal, bold, italic, bold italic), Symbol and ZapfDingbats. \r\n\r\nYou've
    acquired a set of compatible fonts, but they don't look as good as the original
    set and you need a type designer to clean up the outlines, adjust metrics etc.,
    to make them render better.\r\n\r\nIs that what you're asking? \r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si\r\n\r\n"

  body: Brent, are these fonts going to be embedded within Doudesk? Could you elaborate
    a bit on what you think makes the current fonts inferior? I would guess that the
    metrics need to stay identical to what people expect. I would also generally think
    that people would want to use the base fonts that ship with their OS. Is that
    not accurate?

  body: "Heh, didn't even think that people might not know what the \"base 14\" reference
    meant. But if you weren't into DTP in the mid-80s, you might not have dealt with
    that particular set (within a couple of years it was the \"base 35\" instead).\r\n\r\nOne
    reason to have some set of core fonts ship with an application is that the application
    developer may want to be sure that the users have identical fonts, regardless
    of platform. That leads the app developer to need to bundle some fonts with the
    app.\r\n\r\nOf course, simply knocking off somebody else's fonts instead of either
    licensing them or doing something new is rather dubious ethics, but that's another
    question. I have to concede that Times and Helvetica have been knocked off so
    many times now that somehow doing still more knockoffs of those two seems a lot
    less troubling than doing the same to, say, Sabon and Syntax.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: 'I don''t know what fonts Brent has acquired - but it''s certainly possible
    to make fonts based on existing fonts metrics that would not be considered knock-offs
    - Monotype''s Thorndale and Albany being a case in point. Interestingly we''ve
    seen a few recent cases of custom fonts that were designed to match the metrics
    of Arial - Personally I have nothing but admiration for a type designer who can
    make a new design work within the constraints of another font''s metrics. '

  body: "In one of my first jobs (at a weekly newspaper) we had a Compugraphic Compuwriter
    Jr. This was one of the most inexpensive typesetting machines of its time. The
    oddest thing about it was that all of its fonts shared the same set of widths.
    There were gears which would be used to scale the widths as a group up or down
    for a particular font and size. Some fonts looked better than others, but none
    of them looked really good. \r\n\r\n(And, talk about primitive: It had an 18-character
    red LED display and you could only load two fonts of one size at a time. And the
    two fonts were made in fixed pairs. This meant that you couldn't set a line of
    type with more than two fonts in it. But, \"luckily,\" you could set the third
    style separately and paste it over one of the other two, since it had the same
    character widths. AND I lived in a cardboard box in the middle of the street.)"
