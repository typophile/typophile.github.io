  body: "There was a text with this image. It was in an auction catalogue published
    by some auctionhouse -- if I recall correctly -- and I saved the text with as
    well.\r\n\r\nThis is the text that came with it:\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<em>MANOM\xC8TRE.
    NO. 5\r\n\r\nF\xE9vrier 1924. M\xE9lange les langues, enregistre des id\xE9es,
    indique la pression sur tous les m\xE9ridiens, est polyglotte et suprarational.
    [Directeur/ G\xE9rant:] \xC9mile Malespine. (20)pp. Original woodcuts by Jozef
    Peeters (full-page) and \xC9mile Didier. Lrg. 8vo. Self-wraps. Texts by Malespine,
    Roberto A. Ortelli, Michel Seuphor, Bernjamin P\xE9ret, Tristan Tzara, Julio J.
    Casal. Nine issues in all were published of \"Manom\xE8tre\" at irregular intervals
    between July 1922 and January 1928. Though originating in the provincial center
    of Lyon, it was a sophisticated international review, on the Dada-Surrealist axis,
    but with a strong Constructivist component as well. The inclusion of Spanish material
    (by Ortelli and Casal in this issue) is characteristically offbeat and interesting.
    A fresh, crisp copy. Rare.\r\n\r\nLyon, 1924. $850.00\r\n\r\nDada Global 140;
    Almanacco Dada 85; Ades 9.71; Admussen 125; Chevrefils Desbiolles p. 295</em>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSince
    the publication contained woodcuts, apparently, it's possible that the letters
    were either woodtype or one off woodcut lettering. The way the round corners on
    the O and R run into the straight sides remind me of woodtype as well (like a
    toolmark, from something like a router? Just speculating.)"

  body: "I haven't, unfortunately. I found the image [[http://www.arslibri.com/cat130w20.htm|here]]
    (apparently publication No. 5). It's also on [[http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/dada.-malespine,-emile-editor.-manometre.-numb-1-c-q1evhjyiey|this
    page]] (same cover, but apparently No. 6). It says there are woodcuts in it from
    Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and contributions from Mondriaan and others.\r\n\r\nWhen doing
    some more searching, I see that there have been [[http://www.dada-companion.com/journals/per_391.php|more
    publications]] like these. One of them has [[http://www.dada-companion.com/journals/covers_391/460px-cover15.jpg|similar
    lettering]]. Quite interesting designs. :)\r\n\r\n"
