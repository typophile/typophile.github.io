body: "Hi there\r\nI'm trying to make a a MM font in Fontlab 5. I have one weight
  axis. I build the MM I'm working on from two endpoints, a thin and a black. The
  problem is that if I now try to delete a glyph, say the black 'm', and then paste
  a replacement in it's place, Fontlab replaces both the thin and the black 'm'. I
  can't find any mention of that in the manual \u2013 is it impossible to do?\r\n\r\nAnother
  thing is the kerning. How can I (can I at all?) import metrics and kerning from
  other files into the MM font? I'm using identical kerning classes in the thin and
  the black, but I would like to take the metrics and kerning from the two start designs,
  thin and black, and put them in the MM version. How to do?"

    I copy the new glyph to the mask and move the points of the Master to align with
    the mask. \r\nOR\r\nmaking to single master fonts and blend them and copy the
    glyph to the original MM font.\r\n\r\nif you import metrics in the metrics window,
    they apply the the selected master. So you can select the Thin master, import
    the thin afm file, switch to Black and import the black afm file.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\nwww.reets.de\r\nwww.schriftgestaltung.de"

  body: Thanks for the help Georg. I feared it was so, but making a new MM and copying
    the glyph from there works albeit the detour it is. If Twardoch is listening,
    then this would perhaps be something to look at for new versions of Fontlab.

    i would do in this situation is to paste a copy of the new black m to the mask
    layer (make sure there's nothing else in the mask), activate the black master
    and then cmd+j."

    only expressed in a more sophisticated way. I was trying to describe it step-by-step.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if the source glyph (whether it is newer or older) is from another font I believe
    the other alternative is much quicker and more elegant."

    this following your instructions, that's why i posted my own explanation. i guess
    it takes a more sophisticated mind to understand your process, tim. >^p"
