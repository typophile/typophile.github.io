  body: I think these are all Helvetica derivatives &#40;both Franklin and Arial have
    the diagonal cut on the upper terminal of the &#39;a&#39;, while Helvetica has
    the horizontal cut&#41;. &#34;arr&#34; started off as Helvetica Black, but it
    seems like the r&#39;s have been mucked with, or a version from some weird foundry
    was used. <BR> <BR>&#39;Laboratories, Inc.&#39; is Helvetica Bold, and &#39;Making
    medicines work for everyone&#39; looks like it might be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/helvetica-86-heavy-italic/testdrive.html?s=Making+medicines+work&amp;p=48">Helvetica
    Neue 86 Heavy Italic</a>, although it&#39;s hard to tell at this resolution.

  body: I&#39;d say the last line is a very tight <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/76-black-oblique/testdrive.html?s=medicines+work+for+everyone&amp;p=16">Univers
    Black Oblique</a>, slightly squooshed&#153;.. Which would explain why the angle
    is slightly off.

  body: g&#39;ah... I thought it looked like Univers too, at first glance, but then
    I psyched myself out .... &#39;why would they use Univers there if they used Helvetica
    for all the rest?&#39; guess it could have been added later, or, even more likely,
    they just couldn&#39;t tell the difference. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: I think Franz could be right about the last line being univers. Look at the
    &#34;y&#34;, the shape of the descender rules out both helvetica, arial and frutiger.
    Then again it could be something completely different. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: yeah, I was agreeing with him... i just psyched myself out at first by thinking
    they would want to be consistent with the fonts they used. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
