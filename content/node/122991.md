  in what category this typeface would fall into?\r\nI've tried searching for Victorian
  era fonts and flourish fonts with no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\nThanks\r\n-D\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gs_3462.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The fishtail terminations on the letters of this monogram mean that they
    are in the Tuscan category. The letters also have medial spurs. So they're  in
    the medial Tuscan sub category.\r\nYou might find something you like at http://www.myfonts.com/search/tuscan/\r\nDon"

  body: "I agree Ryuk that Baelon Monogram is promising. It has medial spurs as well
    as Tuscan terminations with matching orientations to the image specimen. Here
    is the Baelon Monogram _sG_ as generated at Myfonts\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BaelonMonogramAs_sG_4811.gif]\r\nand
    its unassembled _S_\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BaelonMonogramAs_S_5696.gif]\r\nCompress
    this _S_ for a closer match.\r\nThe only aspects that are completely different
    are the absence of a chin on _G_, the location of the medial spurs on the lhs
    and rhs of _S_ rather than on the diagonal stroke,  and a plain rather than faceted
    treatment of the letters.\r\nDon"
