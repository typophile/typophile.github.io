body: i&#39;m getting up the nerve tp post a something for critique, <BR>but can&#39;t
  figure the best way to post it. i&#39;ve been <BR>working in illustrator, and i
  don&#39;t have flash. so what&#39;s <BR>the best thing to do? i tried saving it
  as .eps and opening <BR>it in photoshop to convert it to something else, but it
  got <BR>very distorted in the process.

  body: You could always select &#34;Save for Web&#34; in the file menu and output
    it as a GIF or JPG. IF the image is large enough, it can still be effective in
    the critique. Or I&#39;m sure someone would be willing to dump it out in Flash
    for you if you preferred that route...

  body: 'Two ideas: 1&#41; if you haven&#39;t already, convert fonts to outlines and
    save the file as another name; 2&#41; Photoshop may open the native Illustrator
    file better than it does an eps, even though it&#39;s the same thing. Hope this
    helps.'
