<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've been comparing differing versions of a font from two different foundry sources, Folio from Adobe in Open Type format and Folio BQ from Berthold in Type 1 format. <br> <br>After converting some letters in each font to outlines, I noticed that while the overall shapes are near identical the amount of points used to define each glyph is significantly greater in Folio BQ than it is in the Adobe version, even on seemingly simple glyph shapes. <br> <br>How does this information correlate to quality, i.e. how well will each typeface stand up to different printing/viewing conditions? My (layman's) guess would be that a greater number of points suggests a sloppier digitization process but I'd appreciate the opinions of the cognoscenti.

<div class=commentbody>James, <br> <br>>Since you perceive that the glyph shapes are identical does it really matter about different digitization techniques? <br> <br>No, you misunderstood me. I was not trying to pass judgement on the font or the digitization process, in fact (although I did use the term 'sloppy', which I already regret) I pointed out that I didn't know the answer myself. <br> <br>I was merely trying to find out what difference (if any) the number of points used to define a glyph might make in the life of a typeface. <br> <br>>It is the result of the rendered glyph that matters.

<div class=commentbody>Usually but not always more points means sloppiness. And in this case I think that's what it is, unfortunately. Sometimes though more points means greater fidelity. It depends on the design too, like a highly geometric sans will be more in tune with bezier-ness, so to speak. <br> <br>And other times too few points are a problem as well. For example in that Adobe "a" there are a couple of missing inflection points: usually this doesn't matter, but for conversion to TT for example it can matter bigtime (especially in Fog). Other cases of extra points being good is for stroke modulation and trapping. <br> <br>On the other hand, when you apply transformations to outline, the fewer the points the better, usually - because the bezier math will take care of it more elegantly than explicit points. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Inflection points are where a curve changes concavity direction. Missing inflection points are easy to spot in cubic bezier (Postscript) curves: the BCPs will be on opposite sides of the curve.

I think we can stop discussing the "sloppy" comment now... <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>OTOH, the discussion was heading off into an interesting direction, namely what advantages if any are achieved by the minimalistic point usage of, say, Adobe versus the way that Ikarus turns out Folio BQ. <br> <br>To my (uneducated) eyes, it seems that there is not one single point in the Adobe version of the font that is not absolutely crucial and that could be removed without completely wrecking the glyph, yet in the BQ version there are additional points galore.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>There are two concerns with large numbers of unnecessary points. The first is font size: every point is a certain number of bytes. The more points you have, the bigger the font. This may not be a significant factor in 8-bit fonts, but when you start including a few thousand glyphs in an OpenType font, the impact can be quite considerable. <br> <br>The second concern is in TrueType fonts in which stray points can cause spikes in delta hinting. If you want to delta a small detail to turn a pixel on or off at particular sizes, you ideally want to touch only one point, not have to delta three separate points.</div>

<div class=commentbody>That's the conversion from quadratic to cubic beziers. In native quadratic, Georgia has about as few points as it would need if it were in cubic. But converters can't replicate "design intent", they can only work "literally": stay within a given error tolerance. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes. The more points there are, the more work the computer has to do to image the letter. <br> <br>They are different means of mathematically describing curves, but not quite in the way you're thinking. You can convert from TrueType style quadratic curves to PostScript style cubic beziers without loss of information, but not the other way. (A really high-fidelity conversion in the second case will require a fair number of added points.) <br> <br>Additionally, it is common, though not required, to change the em-square scale between 1000 and 2048 when going between the two styles of curves. This can add slight rounding errors and further loss of fidelity. <br> <br>Regards, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>I've created fonts in many different genres (using Fontographer, 1000 unit em), and I've found that it's rarely necessary to insert more than one point (if that) between the horizontal and vertical extrema of a curve, in order to sufficiently define that curve for aesthetic accuracy. <br> <br>However, there are some situations where it's necessary, and one of them was the top of my Jenson (Goodchild) "a", where I found it impossible to get close to the old master's form without plenty of points. <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22780.jpg alt=JenA></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>Has it happened to anyone, that a large open type file had to be tidied up afterwards in order to improve performance, or is this not a big deal? When is a font file too big?</i> <br> <br>This is more of an issue in East Asian fonts, where conscientious developers tend to do everything they can to keep the file size down (subroutines, small em size, minimum number of points, etc.) <br> <br>When MS released my Sylfaen font, they ran it through a tool called SplineLab (originally from Project Solutions, not sure if it is available from anywhere; was expensive) which can automatically clean up excessive points within parameters set by the user. I have to say, I'm not very happy with the results, and some of my curve quality was lost. Now when I'm developing TT fonts, I usually clean up the converted PS->TT outlines manually and leave points if they are necessary to maintain the curve quality. In a longish curve, e.g. a quadrant of the O, I can usually reduce the number of FL inserted points from 4 to 2, and on short segments from 2 to 1, without a major problem. The longer curves won't be a true match to the original cubic PS outline, but I can control the result and it is better than what SplineLab does. Once you get into the habit of doing this, it doesn't take long for each glyph, and I consider it part of the design process. <br> <br>A bigger concern in developing OpenType fonts is optimising performance in the OTL GSUB and GPOS tables. Things like contextual mark positioning can slow down processing speeds significantly, so it pays to have a good strategy for minimising the number of lookups. Also, GSUB is more efficient than GPOS, so it makes sense to try to strike a balance between the efficient development and flexibility of GPOS and the faster processing of glyph composition with GSUB. In future versions of my Biblical Hebrew font, I'm considering making a few hundred of the most commonly occuring letter + mark(s) combinations into precomposed glyphs, as this should speed up overall processing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Re. Sylfaen Armenian: Geraldine Wade drew the Armenian, Georgian and Greek. I was only responsible for the massive extended Latin set (most of which is not included in the current release) and the Cyrillic. It's important to remember when looking at Sylfaen that it was originally intended only for an internal MS glyph database, and not as a release font. I was rather shocked when they released it, because neither Geraldine nor I considered it finished and only some parts were properly polished.</div>
