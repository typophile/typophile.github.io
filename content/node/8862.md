  body: 'From James Moran, <i>Stanley Morison: his typographic achievement</i>:  <BR>
    <BR>...in 1785 <i>The Times</i>, under its original name, <i>The Daily Universal
    Register</i>, had been set in an &#39;old face&#39;, but that a bookseller, John
    Bell, inspired by the work of Parisian designers had established his own foundry
    to produce a &#39;modern&#39; face. His punch-cutter was Richard Austin, and together
    they produced the first English &#39;modern&#39; face, which was eventually used
    in Bell&#39;s newspaper, <i>The Oracle</i>. John Walter, of <i>The Times</i> did
    not approve of Bell, but <i>The Times</i> nevertheless, went &#39;modern&#39;
    in 1799, using a Caslon version of this class of type. ... &#39;It is from this
    foundry&#39;, wrote Morison, &#39;that the present <i>Times</i> founts derive,
    and it is at least possible that they were designed by Richard Austin, for he
    worked also for this foundry.&#39; <BR> <BR>I have seen the type called simply
    Times Roman, which was the reason for the new face to have been styled Times <i>New</i>
    Roman.'
