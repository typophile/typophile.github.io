  Chapter of the American Printing History Association presents our first Salon:\r\n\r\nTYPE
  WE LOVE,\r\nTYPE WE HATE:\r\nIndividual Responses to Typefaces\r\n\r\nSoCal APHA\u2019s
  \u201CSalon Series\u201D will be informal, social, and stimulating events that will
  occur on an irregular basis and at a variety of locations. And, like the celebrated
  gatherings held at the homes of worldly and gracious hosts and hostesses in the
  18th and 19th centuries, we aim to bring together a variety of people to discuss
  designated topics in an informal, participative environment. Therefore, we will
  encourage widespread participation in lively discussions, led by Cristina Favretto,
  sharing of materials and experiences, and the formation of new friendships as well
  as the acceptance of new ideas and modes of thinking about the printed word.\r\n\r\nOur
  first Salon topic will center around individual responses\u2014positive and negative\u2014to
  typefaces and type styles. Participants are encouraged to bring examples of printed
  items that appeal to them, as well as of typefaces that negatively impact our reading/viewing
  experience. We will discuss fashions in typefaces through the ages, and bring in
  our collective knowledge and experience to think about our dream matches of type
  and content.\r\n\r\nSouthern California APHA: Salon 1\t\t\t\r\nDecember 13, 2006\t\t\t\t\t\r\n7:00
