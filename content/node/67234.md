  body: This is true, the Association was founded in 1908, but the logo could have
    been created after the fact (I'm hoping!)

  body: "From what I see, this is not a logo, but a commemorative coin. That means
    that most probably they've used something non-digital to do it, even if after
    1908.\r\nIf you do need to recreate it, I think your best chance is to pick up
    the most similar typeface you could find (Century?) and customize the needed letters.\r\n\r\n(maybe
    I'll go for the typeface with the most similar Ss, because they're harder to modify)\r\n"
