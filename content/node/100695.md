  to keep a friendly, approachable spin while having something that could play nicely
  in more serious/sensible surrounds.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/supernaut_5811.jpg]\r\n\r\nAppreciate
  thoughts and feedback on letter shape/weighting.\r\n\r\nWould also love some typeface
  recommends to sit with it.\r\nOur current view sees some contrasting pairs used,
  i.e, VAG and Corona\r\n\r\nAny and all welcome and appreciated."

    is more industrial and better onscreen. I'll resist discussing which has a far
    cooler Italic.  :-)\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I had a hand in the latter.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Yeah. Know and love Ernestine, I wonder if it's to same having (essentially)
    two serifs.\r\n\r\nThink the mark is working ok though? I wonder whether there's
    something off with the p/e ... but can't put my finger on it."
