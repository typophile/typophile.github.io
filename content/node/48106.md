  opinions on the following:\r\n\r\nI'm a graphic designer employed by a small print
  shop. Every so often, i get to design logos, identities, stationery, etc. from scratch
  for clients of said print shop, who then get the printing done here. \r\n\r\nMy
  main question would be: who owns the copyright on the artwork i create? Me? The
  print shop i work for? \r\n\r\nOur client orders have never included contracts (i've
  been here for over 8 years), and only once have i signed an agreement giving up
  legal ownership of the logo i created. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts are appreciated! \r\nThanks
  for your time."

  body: And who knows if the client registered the work themselves. Its rare for a
    designer (or the designers employer) to hold the copyright on a logo or identity
    they created for a client, no matter who did the work.

    10 years later a company is huge and using your logo, could you feasibly sue for
    back-royalties if there's no contract?"

    likely\u2014after all, without a contract there\u2019s no reason for a court to
    believe that there was ever any expectation of royalty payments on the part of
    either party."

  body: "There is so much confusion between trademark and copyright here. A creator
    automatically has copyright to his creation unless it is explicitly signed away,
    which means, as the artist, you can reproduce it to say \"look what I did\" and
    nobody can stop you. The customer, implicitly if not explicitly, has paid for
    the non-exclusive right to copy it as well, and the right to register it as a
    trademark. When they own it as a trademark, that means they own its association
    with a certain trade. If you've done a logo for Whizzo Cookie Company, you have
    the right to use it to sell yourself as a designer, but you don't have the right
    to use it to sell your own cookies. Arguably, you don't have the right to make
    money off the brand in any way they potentially could, like Whizzo Cookies T-shirts.
    This doesn't mean you can't still make money off it, like by putting it in a design
    book as an instructional example, and selling that book. Putting it on the cover,
    though, is when you start treading on the blurry line where lawyers just have
    to fight it out.\r\n\r\nCopyright isn't like a ball that you have to stop holding
    to hand to someone else; it can be in multiple places at once. If you designed
    something under employ of a design business, both they and you can use it as a
    portfolio example, and neither of you can to stop the other from doing so, unless
    you explicitly gave it up that right in the employment contract. If you didn't
    sign anything that actually says what you do is \"work-for-hire\", then it isn't.
    But reminding your employer that you know this is inadvisable unless you have
    a good reason to play with that fire."

  body: "\" it could also depend on what fonts you used. \"\r\n\r\nA way out is :
    Don't use any font. Do your own lettering. Choose a 'school of type', say, a Bodoni.
    Just look at it, draw your own and apply to the logo. The resulting Bodoni will
    be genuinely unique. No head eyk . Can be Clarendon too .\r\n\r\n\" who owns the
    copyright on the artwork i create? \"\r\n\r\nWorking at a print shop you do artwork
    that belongs to your employer; you make sure you get a copy of the files for yourself.
    Don't collect fonts or DO it when using free fonts."
