  body: "\"PALEY'S\" looks similar to <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/clarendon-serial/|Clarendon
    Serial Heavy]]</strong>\r\nbut the /L/E serifs are not so round,\r\nwhile the
    text body is close to <strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/news-705/|News
    705 Roman]]</strong>"

  body: "The smaller text looks a lot like Chronicle by Hoefler & Frere-Jones, and
    they do sell it to magazines and newspapers. The larger type is some sort of Egyptian
    or Clarendon, maybe. Both styles are rather common and are hard to pinpoint with
    only the letters in this sample. If you have more samples available toyou, you
    could also try using the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a> to narrow the search. Key letters in your sample were a, b,
    e, g, y and K. If you can find E, J, M, R, U and W that can help with the Key.\r\n\r\nWith
    these 6 letters I got 119 possibilities, many of which were easy to discard at
    a glance. \r\n\r\n-Mike Yanega"
