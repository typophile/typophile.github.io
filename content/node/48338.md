  body: "Hi Asvetic, \r\nI actually went there first too, is a close alternative,
    Typ1451 is even closer in regards to the A and a little wider...\r\nWhat I like
    about the unknown spec is the mix of rounded and right angles. I have looked through
    a bunch of rounded samples, and could not find any mixed versions like this...\r\nany
    more help would be appreciated\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/superstudio_3740.png]\r\nSuperstudio\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typ1451_5520.png]\r\nTyp1451"

  body: "Gotham Rounded is a beauty, but has all round corners...\r\nAll 'rounded'
    fonts I have found so far have all rounded corners. I have checked AG book rounded,
    Arial, Bryant, VAG, Superstudio, TYP1451... They are all nice, maybe now I am
    being difficult\r\nbut it has made me realise how unique this spec really might
    be, the mix of rounded and right angles is really modern and not as soft as normal
    rounded versions...\r\nhelp?\r\n\r\n"
