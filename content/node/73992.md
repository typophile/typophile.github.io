  body: "The 'S's seem identical, as do the 'E's in \"TALES\" and \"THE\", and the
    other 'E's have the same grunge. The 'A's in \"TALES\" and \"SPACE\" are nearly
    identical, except one seems to bave its leg stretched.\r\n\r\nI bet it's a font
    with points moved around in Illustrator.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    a font, it's had some modifications. Funny how the world goes, isn't it?\r\n\r\n-NJ"
