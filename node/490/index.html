  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys!  <BR> <BR>I need some help to decide on our company logo. We have been through tons of designs, but are not convinced yet. I am not sure whether to use a funky, trendy or modern look or a more serious neutral look. The company offers ALL Design services available and specializes in web and online/offline marketing. Our future plans are to evolve into an integrated advertising agency.  <BR> <BR>With that said, the name of the company is fullride. For full-integration, full-service and full-power. We thought some ideas with a roller coaster (flash intro), a driving wheel (for logo icon) and other simple and emotive things. Any idea for this is SUPER welcomed. The name can be written in caps, in the case anyone wants to try some ideas. The rest of the name or the text below the LOGO reads, &quot;creative design group&quot;. We offer intelligent design that sells effectively and creative ideas that will swipe people off their feet.  <BR> <BR>I wanted to have the name plus some icon so I could use both elements for designing and alternating in my company collaterals.  <BR> <BR>I will really appreciate any ideas or suggestions on this.  <BR> <BR>You ALL understand the toughest decision is to decide on what you want for yourself. THANKS FOR THE FEEDBACK!  <BR> <BR>Jorge.  <BR> <BR>This are some of my ideas: <BR><A HREF="http://www.fullridemedia.com/ideas/logos.htm" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.fullridemedia.com/ideas/logos.htm">http://www.fullridemedia.com/ideas/logos.htm</a></A></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just some things from a non-graphic-designer: <BR>I like the name, but forget that rollercoaster business. Since you're not starting off as some long-term megabucks operation, try to focus on one aspect of the scene in the beginning, to maximize your chances for survival. This focus should be reflected in your logo. And don't use Helvetica - it makes you looks like a 40-something accountant. I like the 4-arrows, but maybe make them point *in*. I also think the slant in the logotype is good, and you might want to choose one letter (maybe in a different case than the rest) that can be made to convey movement. Consider using a set of wide, upright caps for the subtext. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Jorge, <BR> <BR>As a &quot;creative design group&quot;, you'd better push yourselves much harder to make the impact you're going for creatively. <BR> <BR>With the concept of your company being a full service design firm, the metaphors you've suggested are just that metaphors but none of them really speak to the qualities your trying to impress on potential clients. <BR> <BR>As I posted in another critique, your brand goals should be solidly identified before you start killing yourself with rounds of design execution which is what your post seems to suggest. <BR> <BR>Give your company a strong concept first and the logo will present itself! Good Luck! <BR> <BR>Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yeah! <BR>That's the criticism I was exactly looking for. <BR>Thanks Stuart and Papazian. <BR> <BR>Papazian which logo do you consider works better. I didn't get the opinion on the type. By the way, the type used is arial, with simple twists to it. I think you get my feeling on what I think is neutral. If you go and check the major advertising and design firms, as well as clothing designers, they all have simple one or two color logos. most of them just text. since they work with different media and aspects of the business, they remain neutral with their identity. This is an observation I have made and I do not want to mislead my clients for a particular service or specialty. I want to appeal to all markets, nationally and internationally.  <BR> <BR>Something too funky (sort of like a rave flyer or CD cover - which by the way I do like) may not represent seriousness and quality to everyone.  <BR> <BR>I think you guys get my feeling. I originally come from marketing background, I later became a designer.  <BR>(Stuart) The main focus of the company is to offer intelligent marketing design that sells and represents the brand. Not just some cool graphics and colors. Represent the essence and impact the customers. <BR> <BR>I also though about &quot;creative adrenaline&quot; which works good with the fullride concept. <BR> <BR>Stuart, which logo will you go for, or do you have any other suggestions? <BR> <BR>GUYS, I truly appreciate your time and opinions. <BR> <BR>Later, <BR>Jorge</div>

		<div class="commentbody">While it's not really unique or powerful, I like the simplicity of the type treatment on the left hand side and down one and you could even lose the tag line and it would hold up pretty well. <BR> <BR>As far as an icon goes a well done graphic image of an electric bolt or visual fuel gauge may be appropriate start but I think they need something else to combine with to make them more original. <BR> <BR>Perhaps something that represents the full power of media? Granted it's a tall order concpetually, but hopefully it should offer some groundwork for your next round of thinking. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Great you have a theme, that is a good start and a name with a domain name to match ,even better but now what?  Who is the client you are seeking. fortune 500 or a cool music label. Your logo must appeal to them, it should of course also reflect your values and ultimately reel in the jobs you will enjoy doing. If you want to do this right you will need to document everything, make this a case study and not just 30 logos to choose from.  Here are the steps I take for a logo design. (branding is something else altogether). <BR> <BR>Phase1)  Planning <BR>   a) gather content information <BR>   b) decide hierchy of information <BR>   c) examine usage <BR>   d) consider context <BR>   e) define expression <BR>   f) consider capability <BR>   g) establish timelines <BR>     <BR>Phase 2  Elements <BR>   a) choose elements, photos, illustrations, etc   <BR>   b) spec colors <BR>   c) choose proper typefaces or modify exsisting    type faces or design from scratch <BR>   d) evaluate fusibility with existing identity (you may not have anything currently so skip this one) <BR> <BR>Phase 3  Refine Direction <BR>   a) make comps <BR>   b) discard unnecessary elements <BR>   c) emotionalize remains <BR>   d) choose best comp <BR> <BR>Phase 4)   Complete design <BR>   a) refine best comp to a complete design <BR>   b) test legibility-laser, fax, screen, etc <BR>   c) proof prints <BR> <BR>(in between all these phases always carry a sketchbook a sketch as much as you can.) <BR> <BR>the logo should be a strong enough design to not rely on color. Black and White, with no shades of grey if possible.  This of course is just a rule and as they say, rules are meant to be broken.  <BR>Good Luck. <BR> <BR>check out <a href="http://www.logolounge.com">www.logolounge.com</a></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I reckon the first one is the best&hellip;it creates a definite identity. In my humble opinion, the infinity sign has been done to death in company logos + it isn't that inspiring a shape. I would abandon gradient fills within the text&hellip;looks dodgy, especially when in grayscale. The arrows are also promising. I'd like to see more of the thin outline of the first example's font coupled with the straightforward colours of the text, perhaps with the innerfacing arrows. <BR>Matthew Brown</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am new to this forum, reffered to by Mr. Stephen Coles from MyFonts. I am a romanian graphic designer specializing in corporate identity with a particular interest in typography. While I have no academic training (I am a math graduate&hellip;), I have worked on some projects with American design agencies, thus getting the hands-on training needed. This is not enough an it shows now, as I am confronted with a decision making problem. My friends posted the case study at <a href="http://www.grapefruitdesign.com/wireality/id_review01.shtml">www.grapefruitdesign.com/wireality/id_review01.shtml</a>, where you can find the issue and the comments. <BR> <BR>The problem I have is the overall balance of my hand customised logotype, as well as the A-S ans S-T white space. Once these issues solved, I hope my clints will make up their mind. (I have beeen working on this project for 3 months now&hellip;) <BR> <BR>Thank you all in advance. <BR>George <BR> <BR>P.S. this forums are exactely what I have been looking for &hellip; Well done &hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In terms of spacing, I think you're only real problem is the &quot;AS&quot;. One thing you could do (but it wouldn't be enough on its own) is too loosen the whole thing a bit. <BR> <BR>BTW, you might also consider ligating the &quot;ST&quot;. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
