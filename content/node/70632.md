  and yet not trendy or over-styled? Which type treatment (in logos or elsewhere)
  stands out for you as something very descriptive of the era we are living through?\r\n\r\n(oh,
  it's nice to be back here... )"

  body: I think, as we are all quite visual people here, a specimen of such type treatment
