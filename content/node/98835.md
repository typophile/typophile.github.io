  faces for a face I want to design, theorizing about xheights and things like that,

  in a bold, but bold makes this illustration more clear.) \r\n\r\nI'm wondering about
  vertical metrics. What I wish to understand is, what makes Parkinson a display font
  that you'd never use for blocks of text, and what makes Whitman such an awesome
  text font? Also, more fundamentally, I wish to understand what the hell point size
  has to do with the actual vertical metrics of typefaces?\r\n\r\nParkinson Medium
  @72pt and Whitman (Roman or Bold) @88.5pt have damn-near the same xheight and cap-height.
  @72dpi, the Parkinson @72pt measures 72px from desc-line to asc-line, while the
  Whitman @88.5pt measures 83px from desc-line to asc-line.\r\n\r\nI know the answer
  is \"that happens sometimes\" (QED), but my hope is to understand what's happening.\r\n\r\nIS
  there a true-ish statement that can be made along the lines of \"Usually, about
  ____% of the time, in a good text face the cap-height is about ____% of the point
  size and the xheight is about ______% of that, and the ascenders and descenders
  do such-and-so...\" ...?"

    really have anything to do with it. The point size defines an imaginary block
    of vertical space, which the type designer has divided up to suit his whimsy.
    Within that <em>em</em> you'll get an ascender height, cap height, x height, baseline,
    and descender height (often even in that order!), but they could be in any proportion
    to one another and in any proportion to the em. What remains constant as you change
    the point size are the <em>proportions</em>.\r\n\r\nFor example, here are an M
    from Perpetua, and an M from Calisto, both at the <em>same point size</em>. The
    squares have height and width equal to that point size.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/M_versus_em.svg\"/>\r\n\r\nThe
    designer might use only a tenth or a hundredth of the vertical space available
    (although, that would be a painful way to work).\r\n\r\nWhy were you interested
    in Parkinson and Whitman for studying text v. display faces?"

    associations (Rolling Stone, rock-and-roll). \r\n\r\nWhitman because it is a great
    face designed (and successful at) body-text -- plus I find it beautiful and well-made.
    \r\n\r\nI'm looking at other text faces too, to try to get a sense for what makes
    them work well. I thought it was, in part, the proportion of cap-height to xheight.
    The attachment in my original post blows that hypothesis away.\r\n\r\nedit: Something
    else just sunk in. XHeight has been a red herring for me. Alone, it doesn't really
    tell you anything about the vertical proportions of a typeface. If you don't also
    know CapHeight, AscHeight, and DescDepth, you don't really know a face. Also:
    vertical proportions don't really tell you anything about whether a face is a
    good text face. Contrast Sentinel with Whitman with your favorite cut of Jenson.\r\n\r\nSo,
    what does?"

    are the wrong tree. Take a look at Trump Medieval. A good text font. Now look
    at Adobe Garamond, another good text font. Sorta knocks the wind out of the cap
    heigth/ascender heigth/x-heigth/descender depth/small cap height as a matter of
    ratio, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nThe one think you can say about text type is it has
    to be comfortable for a 300-page book.\r\n\r\n& my current rant, which is not
    enough attention is paid to how the type appears. Printed offset, on a certain
    kind of paper -- coated versus uncoated. Or printed on a laser printer on an 8.5
    x 11 sheet of office paper. Or as pixels on a screen. And, uh, which screen?\r\n\r\nWhitman,
    printed offset on an uncoated sheet, is a bit light. Kent knows this. It is worse
    on a coated stock. It is beautiful printed with toner, as with a laser printer.\r\n\r\nNever
    used Parkinson.  Doesn't look very good to me at\r\n\r\nhttp://fontzone.net/font-details/Parkinson-Medium/\r\n\r\nbut
    that's not a fair way to observe the font. I think some of the letterforms suspect,
    but in the final analysis, it's the use that counts.\r\n\r\nIt will probably print
    like Merlo, I suspect. Merlo doesn't print well offset, on an uncoated sheet set
    larger than about 10-point (& that's an iffy combination), but is wonderful on
    a coated paper where the ink doesn't spread much.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/merlo\r\n\r\nThe
    thing about type is, it hasn't much value until used. So look at that."

    glass and look at the characters as they are printed on paper, using the technology
    appropriate. Look how the ink spreads. Notice that the contrast (fine strokes
    to heavy strokes) changes. Or if you own the typeface, make a scan of the printed
    letters (laser versus offset/uncoated versus offset/coated) and bring all those
    up on the screen next to each other -- big, so you can see how the ink spread
    is different on the offset, and character formation & inking different on the
    laser --  and finally compare the scan images to the glyph that was used in the
    typeface. Should be an eye-opener.\r\n\r\nYou can see the same thing on the screen,
    sort of, by looking at text rendered at 10-11 point on a new I-pad versus a Kindle
    Fire. You might get an interesting answer in which is \"better.\" I tried this
    with Utopia. The I-pad has the most faithful reproduction, but to me, the type
    looks better with the Kindle Fire. And who knows what Slimback was anticipating
    when he set the contrast of the glyphs? With this font, maybe the accuracy of
    the I-pad is a problem."

    FWIW, when I designed Whitman I was under a good deal of historical influence
    from my study of Mergenthaler Linotype faces. In hot-metal, there were limitations
    for how close you could get to the top and bottom of the body without risking
    casting problems. \r\n\r\nSomewhere I have a chart with the production specifications
    that Linotype used for the various sizes. I think the average head/foot space
    was around 0.004 inch. But I don\u2019t think I had that in front of me at the
    time, and I believe I undershot even that spec with Whitman.\r\n\r\nAnyway, by
    any standard, Whitman is rather small on the body, around 930 (not including f/g
    over/undershoots). Nowadays I tend to work to around 960\u201380.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    there\u2019s no physical limitation with digital type production, and no one sets
    solid any more anyway. So these things are more about convention and expectations.\r\n\r\nIn
    my opinion, the overall size on the body has less impact on Text vs. Display questions
    than the rest of your internal relationships \u2014 x-height, cap, ascender/descender,
    stems, set widths, fitting, etc."

  body: "Traditionally, type design intended to be used at smaller sizes have the
    contrast between thick and thin reduced, compared to a similar design at larger
    sizes. This is because at small sizes you seem to be bumping up against some kind
    of visual threshold problem, and the thins seem to look a lot thinner, compared
    to the thicks, than when the same design is viewed in a large size. \r\n\r\nThis
    is already true in normal book text sizes, say 9-12 point. Below 9 point, designs
    generally 'cheat' on visual size by increasing the x-height, and having shorter
    ascenders and descenders.  This makes the physical size of details of the design
    big enough that the eye can still recognize them without too much discomfort.
    For the similar optical reasons, the designs intended for small size also increase
    the inter-letter spacing. \r\n\r\nThere are other more subtle effects, but these
    three: contrast, x-height and letter spacing are consistently attended to in traditional
    letter press fonts, and in current digital designs sensitive to optical size.
    \r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the readability of text type benefits from some of
    these adjustments at larger text sizes (10-12 pt), which is why I made my [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|Williams
    Caslon Text]] the way I did. \r\n\r\n"
