  body: "I got no good hits on any of the databases for these glyphs.\r\n\r\nThis
    looks like a Frankenstein logo. Most of it could be reproduced with various weights
    of many sans serifs, including Futura and Myriad, save for the S (the rounded
    over top right\u2014disregarding the custom tail\u2014is more akin to Helvetica)."

    and then got smashed, spread and etc. '
