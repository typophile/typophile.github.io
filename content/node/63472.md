  body: "Finding this kind of font is often a matter of luck more than anything, because
    it's something anyone could make, and this looks like amateur work. I searched
    Dafont and Abstract Fonts looking for this, or anything similar. A foundry called
    [[http://www.abstractfonts.com/designer/305/Fonts%20For%20Peas|Fonts for Peas]]
    had a number of very similar scripts, although none were an exact match. See Pea
    Sara, Pea Amy Rica and Pea Johanna Scripts for some that I thought were quite
    similar.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
