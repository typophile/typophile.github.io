  body: "Oopss... I think I'm stuck in a problem here, I've tryed OPTI Bookman Bold
    Italic Swash for the uppercase characters and it kind of fits, but I'm having
    a hard time with the lowecase characters \"n\" \"v\" \"s\" etc. None of the ITC
    Bookman swash fonts that I have has any lowercase, I also tryed ITC Bookman Bold
    Swash and is too bold, and I don't have any ITC Bookman swash medium at all...\r\n\r\nI'm
    guessing this was made with an old Letraset transfer sheet? could it be possible?\r\n\r\nQ\u2122

    not that half-arsed limp ITC version.
