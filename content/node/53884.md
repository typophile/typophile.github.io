  body: "This is a really nice concept, specially the emanating waves integrated with
    the parenthesis. The only thing that doesn't really look right is the tagline,
    which is awesome for this logo but try making it a little bolder (a medium perhaps).
    I would also try a version with three emanating waves, although the concept is
    sound with only teo.\r\n\r\nIs the right corner of the top of the first left 'wave'
    rounded? or is it just my eyes playing tricks?\r\n\r\nGood stuff!\r\n\r\nJonE."

  body: the line weight of the border seems a tad too heavy for the type within.

    corners to complement the face, but I never finished. Thanks for the reminder.
    ; )\r\n\r\n<em>@aluminum</em>\r\nAgreed. It's been bothering me, too, and wasn't
    sure if it was just me. Thanks."

    Bits]] logo. \r\n\r\nIt was at some point a center of [[http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/logomaid_rip_off|Logomaid-stealing-SimpleBits-logo
    controversy]], so it had a good share of the Internet exposure and it is pretty
    well known."

  body: Part of me feels like the whole thing is too wide. Perhaps if it was fit to
    just "resound" or if the two words were stacked or something? I do love the "idea"
    behind it. Very fitting for the name/company. And the color is spot on, too.

  body: "I really like what's happening with this logo, great concept. I don't know
    if I'm completely picking up on the sound waves on the sides. The top and bottom
    brackets take precedence, and my eyes are also drawn to the \"corners\" formed
    in the negative space. I can't think of any solution at the moment, so I'm probably
    not being very helpful. \r\n\r\nThough I don't think it's too similar to the Simple
    Bits mark, at all."

    colour. Reflecting the motion... further and further away from the centre."

  body: sorry... those closest to the name (( 100% orange, those further from the
    centre of the logo, only 60% of the orange.
