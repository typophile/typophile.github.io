  about this website that is really great.\r\n\r\nMy first post is identifying a font
  that i don't find anywhere.\r\n\r\nI'm working for a client, and unfortunately,
  i've to edit some text but haven't any source to identify this font, so the only
  i have is jpg image.\r\n\r\nso the ultimate question is, what font is iT? :)\r\n\r\nit
  would be wonderful if anyone found it out...\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your
  help\r\n\r\nvictor"

  body: Hi Victor, I think it's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=PRC.123370.0.0">Bryant
    Condensed</a>, it looks slightly [[squooshed]] as well.

  body: "thank you very much!\r\ni'm not sure it's the same one, 'cause some shapes
    are slightly different, but it will work as well, i guess the client will not
    see the difference, let's hope that :)"

  body: "That'd explain the squooshed-ness, assuming it looks like that out of the
    box and I think it does. Well, it doesn't seem to be free, apparently you can
    buy it <a href=\"http://www.linguistsoftware.com/tech.htm\">here</a> as part of
    a bundle for US $99.95.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend buying this, I think you should
    replace it with Eric Olson's <a href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryantcon/index.html\">Bryant
    Condensed</a>, it costs $99.00 for 4 weights. You'd save 95 cents and gain a    lowercase
    as a bonus. :^D"
