body: "i was reading through the FontLab Studio 5 manual last night on naming and
  it points out that the weights \"Thin,\" \"Extralight,\" and \"Ultralight\" should
  be avoided. I thought there was some more infomation on this problem here on typophile,
  but i'm not finding it right off. Can anyone point me to some reading that explains
  the problems associated with these weights and how to work around this? The FLS5
  manual suggests using the light designation for ultralight fonts, but the problem
  is i'm using light for the light fonts.\r\nAnother thing, when I do enter the weight
  as Extralight it automatically sets the weight value to 200. When i run check names
  i get a message that states \"- Weight value is less than 250 which is not recommended\".
  Is it actually the weight value that is the issue and not the name Extralight? If
  so, can i just cheat and set the weight value for the Extralight to 250 and be done
  with it? Any help is much appreciated, thnx for looking."

  body: "There is some situation on Windows in which, if you use a value of 200 or
    lower, the screen image will be doubled up to make it thicker, as if the weight
    specified would be too thin to display otherwise. Needless to say, this would
    interfere with the designer's intent about how the font should look. The solution
    (i.e., hack, workaround) is to not use a value lower than 250.\r\n\r\n(Sorry for
    the lack of concrete information. There was a discussion about this either here
    or on the FontLab forum, but I can't seem to find it. This is all from memory.)"

  body: "I remember Adam talking about it during a FontLab training session in New
    York. The problem is the naming and value number. I may be mistaken, but I think
    the idea was to not select the category extralight and to use Light instead (even
    if your stem widths really are xtralite). Also, include Xtralite in the name of
    the font. My memory of the screen weight doubling in Windows is the same as Mark's
    above. \r\nIt is pretty rare to see an xtralite weight used for small sizes so
    screen draw is less of an issue.  At text sizes, there just aren't enough pixels
    to display the font.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: 'The workaround is to name the font whatever you damn well please, but change
    the weight fidure to something north of 400. I have done this in my font families,
    and they work fine. Font Validator sees that there is a disconnect between the
    name and the number, but this doesn''t (seem to) cause any actual problems. The
    other great thing about manual tinkering with the weight figure: you can name
    fonts whatever you like, and OS X will list the fonts in the font menu in the
    numeric order. So, if you want to have "emaciated", "skinny", "plump", and "bootylicious",
    you could do that by numbering the fonts 500, 600, 700, and 800 respectively.'

    there are certain weightclass combinations that are okay, and others that are

  body: well, just reporting back, i set the font weight of my ExtraLights to 250
    and no weirdness in Word at least. Does anyone know what some of the other potential
    problem applications would be that might display ExtraLight fonts incorrectly?

  body: "AFAIK, if you identify one of the problem applications, you don't need to
    test in all of them. They are working the same way.\r\n\r\nIt's my theory that
    the reason for the bug is a combination of a stupid assumption by the application,
    and the way Windows GDI works.\r\n\r\nThe dumb assumption is that any font that
    isn't the bold style of another font has a weightclass of 400, and anything that
    is the bold style of another font has a weightclass of 700.\r\n\r\nSo, you select
    a font. The app says, \"okay, that's the base font 'Glurbish', so the weightclass
    is 400.\" Doing this WITHOUT checking the weightclass.\r\n\r\nThe app then calls
    GDI for Glurbish with a weightclass of 400. GDI as always returns the closest
    match it can find. GDI will also automatically embolden fonts for you if you don't
    have a bold. So let's say there is no bold version of Glurbish, and there is only
    an ExtraLight (weightclass 200). The app asks for Glurbish-400, and GDI says,
    well, I could give them Glurbish-200, or I could do a faux bold and add 300 to
    that. Well, Glurbish-500 would be closer, so I'll do the faux bold on top of Glurbish-200.
    Or if you have a real style-linked bold, you get that instead.\r\n\r\nSo that's
    why 250 is the exact lowest value that works safely in such an application.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the style-link combination stuff is *really* weird though, and I don't think
    I ever figured out all the reasons why it works the way it does.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"
