  We were assigned to design a poster for an art gallery exhibition on a typographer
  and I need help coming up with a concept and also a tag line/slogan. The typographer
  that I have is [[Paul Renner]], the guy who designed [[Futura]]. Any ideas would
  be great and would be a big help!

  body: Well one of my ideas that I have is sort of focus on the way Futura is used
    a lot on identities of fashion lines like Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein and D&G.
    Also I noticed that It's also used on perfumes by Britney Spears and J.Lo and
    as well as in Ikea catalogs and many other magazine ads. I need a slogan/tag line
    that would tie those in together.

    not the reason why Hrant Papazian once called it <strong>Fartura</strong> on this
    site?\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong \u2013 I really <em>like</em> Futura, but Chester,
    does that give you any ideas for your slogan? Apparently Hitler liked the look
    of it too.."
