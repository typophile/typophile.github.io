  it will catch on some day.\r\n\r\nSo I've been playing around with the source code
  of Metafont and managed to create a framework that has some features of Metafont
  but outputs glyphs in SVG and is implemented in JavaScript. As in Metafont, one
  writes pieces of code (in this case JavaScript code) that generate the glyphs. But
  in this case the result can be easily presented with any sort of a GUI (using HTML+JavaScript)
  allowing for interactivity.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick and dirty demo of original Knuth's
  Computer Modern with two adjustable parameters: [[http://www.epilib.com/mf]] (works
  smoothly in Chrome). For me, Computer Modern with slightly thicker horizontal strokes
  seems a lot nicer.\r\n\r\nSo, what do you think?\r\n\r\nWould anyone use this little
  framework to design fonts (i.e. would anyone take it seriously)? This would involve
  the understanding of Metafont (see also [[http://typophile.com/node/13885]]), knowing
  the basics of JavaScript, and me writing some sort of manual and may be introducing
  some improvements. On the plus side, the resulting fonts could be presented in really
  fun ways (with adjustable parameters, animations, etc.)."
