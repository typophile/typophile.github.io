  with doing a doodle type style for a poster, and although it is not yet decided
  if it will go ahead yet, I still think its an awesome effect. Attached to this post
  are a number of examples I found on places like flickr and google and one great
  advert as well. When experimenting, I found they key is to be patient and have a
  little faith. It takes a while to take shape. Any thoughts on my effort shown above
  are appreciate. Not quite finished yet tho. \r\nhope you guys think these are as
  cool as I do.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2200183211_78fc7ed948_5972.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2272651332_7c478bcdbc_b_5497.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2591269575_21f42bf1c3_o_6562.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2635880156_63a99635d0_o_5829.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3154114314_00a31bf0f4_4820.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/10032008165635171053_4070.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/commercial,drawings,food,advertisement,art,ball,point-0cfad7bad178ea495082a692c24e4f30_h_3955.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ist2_5558088-spiral-doodles-notepaper-xxl_3963.jpg]\r\n"
