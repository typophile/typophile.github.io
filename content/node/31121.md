  which is highly regarded. It comes in 6,9,12. As I am mainly doing standard text
  work, at around 10 or 11 pts, am I right to assume that the 9 is the one to go for?
  Font_Font, who sell the product never replied to my question!\r\n\r\n2)I am a WordPerfect
  user, and am really unable to access ligatures (I tried with Walbaum Text Pro from
  Storm. I can do it in Word, using the character map, but WP does not support this.
  WP said to use ctrl W, which brings up sets, typographic, multinational etc, but
  the ligatures in the typographic sets are just some standard sans serif horror,
  not the face one is using!\r\n\r\nAny thoughts\r\n\r\nJohn"

  body: "WordPerfect doesn't properly support Unicode, so there aren't many workarounds.
    One which sometimes works is to open up the Character Map utility and copy and
    paste the character you would like from the character map to your WP document;
    but it sounds like you've tried that, and, yes, WP's extended character handling
    is atrocious. Sadly, full Unicode support doesn't seem to be a huge priority for
    them, as it would break the way their program works internally, due to some shortcuts
    taken a decade ago. If using ligatures is important and not using MSWord is also
    important, you might want to consider OpenOffice...\r\n\r\nAlex the fellow WordPerfect
    user..."

  body: "thanks, Alex. At least I know I haven't missed any workaround! (And, yes,
    I did try copy and paste...which did not work. Actually,it is what I did in Word.
    Was that the quickest way with Word?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nJohn"

  body: Probably that's the quickest way with Word. A hacky way to get around this,
    and it may violate your font EULA, would be to make a new font--for in house use
    only--with just the ligatures and special characters you need in it. WordPerfect
    is great at switching fonts mid-document.
