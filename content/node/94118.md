body: Sorry if that is an odd question. I need some ideas for my website logo. I want
  it to be simple, timeless, and pretty geeky as the site is about transcribing the
  spoken word and trainspotting details of broadcasts.

  body: "HVB thinks that you are using the term 'transcribing' for the operation of
    turning shorthand into longhand.\r\n\r\nIn the context of your other posts here
    my guess is that you are building a website where you show samples of type from
    old tv-shows and such.\r\n\r\nIn case you want to emulate a specific period, research
    that and choose the one that evokes it best."

  body: "BV  - close - I think of transcribing as converting sound to print in the
    first place - i.e., taking shorthand.\r\n\r\nNick - Thanks for the explanation.
    I'd always associated it with the broadgauge equivalent of birdwatching. (Do you
    have a Raritan River 0-4-0 in your collection?) \r\n\r\nIn other words, my original
    comment really meant exactly the same as what Liam said later:  \"I do not understand\"!\r\n\r\n

  body: Yes basically I want to trainspot the contest. It has never been done before.
    But now I need to find a logo for my website where I publish my findings! Thank
    you all so much for your help. This place is a lot of fun. I love reading other
    peoples research too.

    old Eurovision TV shows?"

  body: Yes it is all about the contest. I just wanted to say these two words on the
    forum and see what came to mind for you guys as you are so creative. But now I
    think I will use a font from one of the first shows to make my logo.

    looking at trainspotting, but the \u201Csport\u201D itself makes an excellent

  body: "I actually know a guy who participated in and won a gameshow on the topic
    of Eurovision. Funny bloke. Anyway, I would consider hiring a lettering artist
    to come up with something evoking of the Eurovision glamour. Not too flamboyant
    or overly dated though. Eurovision might be tacky now, but some of those oldies
    really had style.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m still a bit confused. You seem to be looking
    for something retro, but your original post says otherwise."

  body: "When Sandie Shaw won in 1967 with <em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iseZexzSDoM\">Puppet
    on a String</a></em>, it was like none of her other songs, a real sell-out tailored
    to appeal to square Europeans, or it seemed to teen mod moi. As Sandie said, \u201C\"I
    hated it from the very \uFB01rst oompah to the \uFB01nal bang on the big bass
    drum. I was instinctively repelled by its sexist drivel and cuckoo-clock tune.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs
    well as being simple, timeless and geeky, Comic Sans is a guaranteed crowd pleaser
    for people who don\u2019t know any better, and don\u2019t care. You could increase
    its appeal with a bright RGB color and dropshadow.\r\n\r\n"
