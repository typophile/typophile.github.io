  body: Huh. <BR> <BR>First Wes Anderson film that doesn&#39;t have David Wasco as
    the production designer, I think. He used to do all Anderson&#39;s stuff, as well
    as Tarantino&#39;s. <BR> <BR>This is mostly interesting because David Wasco is
    Jim Wasco&#39;s brother. Jim is a type designer and font production guy &#40;not
    to mention keyboard player and brewer&#41;. I worked with him at Adobe for a bunch
    of years, and he&#39;s now a manager at Agfa Monotype. <BR> <BR>Sorry for the
    digression. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Digressions are good. <BR>Especially if you get to drop <BR>some names in
    them! <i>just kidding</i> <BR> <BR>By your first comment, &#34;Huh.&#34;, <BR>I
    am guessing that you didn&#39;t <BR>particularly approve of outlined <BR>Futura
    as a title?
