  branding. The company is an eLearning producer and has been using Verdana for 100%
  of everything. Visually, I'm more relaxed when reading Calibri - as it's not as
  wide as Verdana. But I'm not sure that a switch to Calibri will mean anything to
  anyone else.\r\n\r\nHow do you recommend we go about selecting (and justifying)
  a new standard set of fonts for our marketing and corporate communication?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your insights.\r\nIrene"

  body: "IKEA switched over entirely Verdana last year and nobody outside of typography
    forums seems to have noticed.\r\n\r\nIn making a choice of type for branding,
    it helps to know as much about the company and product as possible.\r\n\r\nDoes
    the company already have an established identity? To what extent are they open
    to changing it?\r\nWhat is the specific nature of the product line?\r\nWho are
    the targeted customers? Are the people who buy the product actually the same as
    the end users?\r\nWhere are they located? Do they want to express a regional association
    or conceal it, or do they feel it should be irrelevant?\r\nWhat situations require
    specific font designations, and where can product/publication designers be allowed
    free rein? Is readability or brand identification the greater concern?"
