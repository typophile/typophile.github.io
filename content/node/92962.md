  to put chess games on my web site in Figurine Algebraic notation.\r\n\r\nThere are
  some fonts suitable to that purpose, but as these web sites evidence, they're not
  being used as web fonts just  yet...\r\n\r\n[[http://mip.noekeon.org/HTMLTTChess/index.html]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.strategems.org/fonts/fonts.htm]]\r\n\r\ninstead,
  users are still expected to download the special fonts and install them on their
  computers.\r\n\r\nAt least with commercial fonts, apparently some sites are using
  webfonts for Chess,\r\n\r\n[[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/commentary_live-wcc-2012-anand-appears-to-have-weathered-the-storm_1687859]]\r\n\r\nalthough
  it's possible that the site is just using something that I happen to have on my
  computer. (The white Knight, for example, is the letter N: the font is not Unicode,
  so it's easier to compose the chess games without special software.)"

    so you may have a symbol font on your machine that includes them. There's one
    (Segoe UI Symbol) in Windows. However I don't think Unicode has enough components
    to lay out a chess board properly.\r\n\r\n>Ah. The font - and even the JavaScript
