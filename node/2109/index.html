So, it's like a pun. <BR> <BR>But the second variant still makes me think it is better - I cannot really tell why. <BR> <BR>The email was sent. Waiting for reply from the client.

I think that the type is appropriate it looks solid but friendly. It looks <i>stable</i> and the colours give it an approachable and nice feel. <BR> <BR>The accent in accent <b>is</b> funny. I like the 2 series because I like the idea of some kind of comet-meteor- progress- forwardThinking-risingStars idea that occurs to me when I see it. It's so long though will it cause heartache in layouts? <BR> <BR>Good luck. Let us know when the client chooses! <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the wording of the &quot;accent&quot;, that is in the last example of mine - but seems like people don't (it's hard to get rid off this feeling since everyone is trying to suggest yet another variant). So what's wrong with mine? :D Just tell me straight. Is it too plain and simple? Not really expressive? Dull?&hellip; <BR> <BR>What bothers me is the type treatment of the &quot;accent&quot; - thus a bigger rendering. Also, I would like to hear more about the usage of secondary typeface (ITC Legacy Sans, as already mentioned) for the &quot;hr solutions&quot; phrase. I normally try to stay with one typeface throughout a logotype, but in this case I find using the same typeface for the smaller lettering a bit weak - it looks poor, I would even say badly legible. (Seems, like I am critisizing myself even more, than the others :D ). <BR> <BR>Anyway, these two points bother me. And as this seems to be a really quick job (that is - next week the client has to have stationery and a bilingual website running), I think it's a high time deciding on a logo. <BR> <BR>Not that I am in a hurry, but&hellip; you know&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Alex, <BR> <BR>Don't know where you are with this job right now. Too late for feedback? <BR> <BR>Why did you choose the e for the accent? Just curious. Kinda makes me want to put the emphAsis on the wrong sylAble. What if it was on the a? I prefer #2 of your examples. It is more visually dynamic. <BR> <BR>Also, I'm not crazy about Melior. It's a fine typeface, but in this case seems to lack personality. Try this (it might help with your design slump too :-) Print it out the word set in Melior nice and big. Get out some translucent paper (tracing etc) and work over the letters with a pencil. Alter the letterforms a bit, make it more like a bodoni, make it more like a slab serif, try a more even weight, try a sans serif Melior.  Move quick and use lots of paper. <BR> <BR>Oh, can it just be Accent HR? That rolls so much better. Words like solutions in a logo don't really add much IMHO. But clients will be clients.</div>

Wow I am suprised that there was such a strong negative reaction to the Melior, but then some people just don't get it. <BR> <BR>Of the examples that you show in the last instance I like the first and last best. The middle Helvetica one is just too boring. <BR> <BR>I like the look if the accent mark in the last, kind of  like a streaking meteor and it looks good with that slight triangle shape. <BR> <BR>I just can't help but think that if the client thinks that Melior=Rotis (huh?), that even what you have shown here will be seen the same way. <BR> <BR>Other directions for the type (to move it away from the client seeing the &quot;same kind of thing&quot; might be: Paralucent? Nick Shinn's Alphaville. FF faces - BJ is right. <BR> <BR>The thing about your design is because it's so typographic when the client says change the type your project almost starts over. <BR> <BR>I like the accent on the first one in the last example. <BR> <BR>Also maybe an accent that intrudes into the letterform? <BR> <BR>Hang in there. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

My choice is basically limited to the Adobe type. If the type is chosen and approved, I go to myfonts.com and buy it. Yes, FontFolio cost me $3 for a cd in my motherland, but I do buy typefaces and tell the client, that he *needs* to buy one (normally, a family), if he doesn't want any problems. Nobody - nobody - wants. Just interested - how would you try a FF font or Linotpye font (I miss those so much), if you don't have one on your harddrive? Just curious. <BR>Also, why do I keep using Legacy throughout the designs? I do not know, how good or bad it is to use the same face in the logo and stationery and everywhere. Normally, a logo would be one font and corporate work horse would be something different. This time Legacy caught my heart, when I saw it in a letter. I do not know why I am trying to apply it for a logotype. Maybe I am wrong at this point. <BR>So, that's why so many different faces. The client will definitely see less. <BR>Now you turn.

That didn't work. <BR> <BR>I like the Human T direction. The thing about that is that it looks somehow too small. The dot, the t, maybe both look too small. I don't know. I like the idea. <BR> <BR>Keep at it. The comet thing does really work if you have to go with it. I would (if time permits) try some different sizes and combos of color in the Human T series to see if it can balance out. Of the Human T series presented here I like the first example the best. <BR> <BR>Daniel, did you mean that the Human T idea resembles too much sign figures, or is there a particular logo that springs to mind? I can only think of stick people holding hands in a circle to create a starburst. :-P</div>

I was feeling really good last night after I posted it - and was, frankly speaking, awaiting for something more opitmistic, than &quot;lose those legs, dude&quot;. :D Not that I am somehow offended or anything - I just don't get it. It looks really &quot;original&quot; now, not resembling anything at all, isn't it? The legs do help the T to be even more human than before. Sweet, cute? I say - more straightforward. <BR>Santiago, thanks for the tip. Dangerously close, yes. <BR> <BR>Last night, when at home, I was again looking at the leggy humat T thing and was thinking, that this is now the end. Today morning I've come back to office - and now I don't even know why I don't like anything else from my designs anymore. <BR> <BR>Plus, are you sure, it should be circle, not elipse? The circle looks to geometric to me - way too much - to be used with a font like Ocean/Legacy/Stone/[even] Delta&hellip; not? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Alex (almost crying) <BR> <BR>:D</div>

I'm sending this to the client with the ultimatum &quot;there will be no more&quot;. he has to choose. it's already [almost] all the same for me. <BR>Whatever. <BR> <BR>I am going to Swiss <a href="http://www.topin.ch/show_big_image.php?bild=zer.jpg">Zermatt</a> tomorrow, the client, a friend of mine, is going with us as well. I'll be back on Sunday night and till that time we will have enough time and inspiration sources to decide. Sorry, HE will decide - I can't. <BR> <BR>I may post preprint shots of logo and stationery sometime next week, if you are interested. <BR> <BR>Thanks again. <BR>Alexey <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21406.gif" alt=""></div>
