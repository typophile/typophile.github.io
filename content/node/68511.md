    If I recall correctly it was for Dutch and French toilet rolls.\r\n\r\nOut of

    added your [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/gtype/geetype/?&sample_text=Kussenzacht%20Coussin%C3%A9&update=0|Geetype]]
    to my list ;-)\r\n\r\nIndeed, it's toilet paper.\r\n\r\nI'll send you a mail in
    a few moments.\r\n\r\nAllison."
