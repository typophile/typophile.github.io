  that I have installed on my computer. But there are problems with using this font
  for Latin characters and I was wondering if there is something similar, but better
  that you know about.\r\n\r\nIt should be just as simple and have rounded terminals.
  I only need the uppercase letters.\r\n\r\nThanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_sample_4765.png]"
