  not a designer so I'm pretty new to this.  Any help is appreciated.  \r\n\r\nSurfed
  fonts.com forever.  Closest I could find is maybe this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?productid=592310&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=13038&query=FF%20DAX&SCOPE=Fonts\r\n\r\nBut
  the O is too elongated. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?productid=592665&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=13259&query=FF%20DAX&SCOPE=Fonts\r\n\r\nThis
  might be it but the bar on the A doesn't drop down enough.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.

    great site for finding type.\r\n\r\nI believe this is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_kievit_ot_medium/?&sample_text=SUBSCRIBE%20POST%20A%20JOB&acs_pt=32&update=0&affid=99346\">FF
    Kievit</a>."
