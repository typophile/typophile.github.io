    Express]], which is similar to some Trekkie-based font, apparently (see [[http://www.dafont.com/starfleet.font?nb_ppp=50&text=REJECTS|Starfleet]]
    and [[http://www.dafont.com/federation-classic.font?nb_ppp=50&text=REJECTS|Federation
    Classic]])\r\n\r\nSome stretching and a few tweaks to the outlines and you're
    there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
