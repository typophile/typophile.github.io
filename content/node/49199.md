body: "hello typophile! I'm working on a comic book logo, wanting it to reference
  the gorgeous old auto-shop signs that you see rusting all over the US. I am aware
  that a lot of these were hand crafted by the sign shops that were commissioned for
  the them, but I was hoping someone can give me a handful of suggestions of typefaces
  I could start from when illustrating the logo.\r\n\r\nexamples...\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ref06_4741.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ref12_3771.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ref14_5297.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ref16_5460.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ref19_4949.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks

    something up in FontStruct</a> that emulates the style, but because it's strictly
    modular it's not nearly as refined as most of the above. Please let me know if
    you end up using it."
