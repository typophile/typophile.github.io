  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi All...

I'm new here and don't really know "font etiquette."  Hopefully someone can help me out with my question.

I'm starting up a business creating greeting cards, invitations, announcements, etc.  I'm not sure what the best route is for me to go about purchasing fonts.  I'd like to offer a wide range of fonts because all my customers will have different personal styles.  Should I:

1. Purchase a Font Package that offers various styles (although I’m worried they may include too many that I wouldn’t use).  If so, any suggestions for good font packages that would be good for all types of cards (wedding, birthday, holidays, birth announcements, etc).

2. Purchase them individually as the customer picks them out.  If so, what is the best way to show fonts?  Online seems a bit ridiculous because there are so many, but I cannot think of any other way to show options since I would not own the font at that point.

It would be less expensive (in the beginning) to just purchase the fonts as each customer picks them, then I’d be able to offer those fonts as my business grows. Hope these questions seem valid to someone.  I’m new at this but have gone back and forth with which way to go.  

Thanks for your help.
Lisa

		<div class="commentbody">Since you are just starting out, to get a running start without shelling out big bucks:

Browse the CDs for the various DTP software you may have. Many of them have a nice selection of fonts on the CD. For instance, Painter 7 had thousands of quality URW PS and .ttf fonts bundled. If you are using PC OS, then there are also many quality .ttf fonts budled with some of the old cheap graphics programs like Print Artist. Version 4 Deluxe had thousands of Agfa .ttf fonts. Also look through any Hallmark software. Apparently some very good font designers have done work for them.

Then you can buy a few selected fonts that are more versatile, with swashes and flourishes and alternates. Apparently the Bickham Script set is a must have.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Take a look at [[Font Starter Packs]]. It really depends on how much you want to pay; if you state that, it may be easier to figure out what you should get. The larger packages I've seen (Fountain, ShinnType, StormType, PSY/OPS) will run you between $1000 and $2500.

I'd recommend you buy a set of typefaces and then have your customers pick from them; having them choose from unpurchased type could be overwhelming and overly expensive.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">At foundries like Process Type, you can buy one weight now and if you later want the whole face, they will apply the cost of the font you already bought. I think that's a great way to build your library without losing the benefit of a discount for buying the larger amount.

If that was clear as mud, you can contact Process. They are super nice.

		<div class="commentbody">I recommend going with a collection. With this in hand, you can give clients the collection PDF so they have a list of options to pick from.

Another package to recommend is the FontFont <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/products/fontcds/ff_skill_set_advertising_packing_mac_ps/">Advertising and Packaging Fonts</a> set. It's not bargain, but it's much less expensive than buying the fonts separately and you get what you pay for: quality. And I was personally involved with editing the collection, so I can confirm that there isn't any filler in there. </div>
