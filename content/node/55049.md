body: "Or rather an \xE6?\r\n\r\nIn the [[http://typophile.com/node/50618|crit thread
  on my handwriting-inspired font]] we ran into this question. I have little experience
  with this glyph. \r\n\r\nIn handwritten form, would \xE6 usually be written like
  an 'a' and then an 'e', but abutted? Or does one swing down and around and up and
  around, so that the crossbar of the a goes right into the crossbar of the e? Or
  does a handwritten form most often employ a single-story 'a' form?"

  body: "I'm curious how French speakers write \xE6 and \u0153, since both are supposed
    to be used in French (though they're really, really rare).\r\n\r\nI myself rarely
    write \xE6. When I do, I usually begin by tracing the loop of a half-hearted single-storey
    a, clockwise, and then connect the e from there, so I end up with something like
    this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ae_4132.gif]\r\n\r\nIt's a hassle
    to write, and I suspect if I were writing in a language that uses \xE6 frequently,
    I'd use a simpler form."

  body: "This is how I tend to write it when using IPA or when using those few words
    in English that use it, pretty similar to Jonseong just with a more clearly defined
    two-story a (which is my normal a).  However I do know it's the same form used
    by Spaniards when writing a cursive x (then again, their cursive f is my esh so...).
