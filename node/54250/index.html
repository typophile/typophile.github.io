[img:sites/default/files/old-images/futurism_6547.jpg]
Giacomo Balla's Street Light ^^^
Giacomo Balla was one of the founding members of the first Futurist painters. Futurism is a modern art movement originating among Italian artists in 1909, when Filippo Marinetti's first manifesto of futurism appeared, until the end of World War I.
Futurism was a celebration of the machine age, glorifying war and favoring the growth of fascism. Futurist painting and sculpture were especially concerned with expressing movement and the dynamics of natural and man-made forms.

Vladimir Tatlin - Monument to the Third International - 1919-20 ^^^
Russian Constructivism was a movement that was active from 1913 to the 1940s. It was a movement created by the Russian avant-garde, but quickly spread to the rest of the continent. Constructivist art is committed to complete abstraction with a devotion to modernity, where themes are often geometric, experimental and rarely emotional.

Edvard Munch- The Scream 1893 ^^^
Munch was a Norwegian painter and printmaker whose intensely psychological and emotional themes was a major influence on the development of German Expressionism in the early 20th century. His painting The Scream is regarded as an icon of the existential anguish of the post-industrial modern age. It may have been partly inspired by the raw quality of African tribal art. This painting has always stood out to me because its full of emotion.</div>
