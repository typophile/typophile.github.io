body: '...why Arial was even created. The story goes that When Bill Gates designed
  Microsoft he didn''t want to pay for Helvetica so he got Arial from Monotype. There
  are a lot of "Helveticas" out there, licenced to different companies, like Swis721
  BT licenced to Bitstream. So why did Microsoft choose Arial? AND WHY DO SO MANY
  PEOPLE USE THIS UGLY TYPEFACE?????'
