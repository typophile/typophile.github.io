  company went out of business.\r\nI am trying to place the font and I know that it
  is not just a picture because some of the other advertising used other letters than
  just the cameo pizza logo letters. I was wondering if anyone could help me locate
  this font."

  body: A more likely scenario (given that Nick Carter's copyright is 65 years later
    than the date you gave for the billboard) is that Nick Carter digitized an old
    font, modifying some characters as he did so.
