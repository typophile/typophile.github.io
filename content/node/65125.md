  packed with acronyms (not a surprise when discussing NASA).  Not being familiar
  with small caps, I just need to know whether to capitalize the first letter.  Is
  it \"nasa\" or \"Nasa\" when in the middle of a sentence?  And since my plan is
  to make small caps any acronym longer than 3 letters, would \"WF/PC\" be full caps
  or small caps?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Although I'm not about to claim I'm a massive small caps expert, I have been
    using it quite a bit lately. If it was me, I wouldn't capitalise NASA at all if
    you're using small caps already. I'm not a fan of caps used with small in the
    same word. I think to keep consistent with the rest of your acronyms, I would
    probably use small caps on the WF/PC as well.\r\n\r\nCan I ask why you're not
    using small caps for acronyms less than 3 letters?"

  body: Bringhurst suggests the usage of small caps in any acronyms just as the usage
    of oldstyle figures in numbers inside a text, as a way to preserv the legibility
    flow.

  body: "Marco hit it on the head. Use all small caps, no need to do a regular cap
    at the beginning. If you can, use open type all small caps for your character
    styles (in InDesign), that way it will force capitals to be small caps.\r\n\r\nOH!
    and be sure to letterspace small caps!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.evanmade.com\"

  body: What about when the acronym begins a sentence? Capitalize the first letter?
    Everything? Nothing?

    see what I thought. My sceenshots may be a little large. The typeface is Scala.\r\n<em>capitalize
    first letter</em>\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/acro1_5039.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>capitalize

    I'd go with rearrange or keep it all opentype small caps (capitalize nothing).\r\n\r\nOther
    than the mess about NASA, can you guess who this text is about?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.evanmade.com\"
