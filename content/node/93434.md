  texts ranging from poetry and  parts of philosophical novels to unclassifiable combinations
  of text and pictures. The book will also have pages showing pictures from Kurt Schwitters
  collages and actual pictures of his books (poems).\r\n\r\nNot sure if i should use
  a serif font or not...all suggestions more than welcome"

  body: "What Riccardo said.\r\nThe pictures will have much old type, so create a
    typespec which is diametrically opposed. As the subject matter is apparently from
    the early 20th century, then something new and recent would work well.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=sanuk&x=0&y=0\">Sanuk</a>,
    for instance, which I \uFB01rst came across, in use, by Marian Bantjes, for the
    ID she created for TypeCon in Seattle.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pinterest.com/pin/49539664621259608/\">Paul
    Rand</a> might have used Univers Bold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
