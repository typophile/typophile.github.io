body: "Q: What faces would you use to set an edition of Lewis Carroll's <em>Alice's
  Adventures in Wonderland<em>?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIt's a really fun challenge \u2013
  setting a text that gives you a license to get fanciful, but trying to do so tastefully.
  I'd love some feedback and additional ideas for the choice of faces.\r\n\r\nI feel
  like you need at least a second face for display, and possibly a third for drop
  caps \u2013 I feel like you need drop caps in Alice, but I'm reluctant to use the
  same face as the text (too dull) or chapter names (too repetitive).\r\n\r\nBeyond
  that, the iconic words \"EAT ME\" and \"DRINK ME\" in the text seem to cry out for
  a special, decorative treatment, but four faces is getting pretty ridiculous. Perhaps
  one should just make do with letterspaced caps/smallcaps. Also: I'm inclined to
  use the text face for the running headers and folios, though that's not beyond question
  either.\r\n\r\n<strong>Text</strong>\r\nMy current top candidate is, to my surprise,
  some kind of Bodoni for the text. It never would've occurred to me, but I've seen
  a couple editions set in Bodoni, and thought it worked surprisingly well. (I tried
  Bulmer for awhile, to at least get the country of origin to match, but it wasn't
  nearly as good.) \r\n\r\nI originally wanted to use something 21st century, and
  my very first thought was [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php?id1=dolly&id2=info|Dolly]],
  but I don't think it captures enough of the mystery of the story \u2013 it sort
  of domesticates it. I feel the same way about [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_clifford_pro/|Clifford]]
  to a lesser extent, though I'm still considering it. In the Bodoni vein, I also
  considered Nick's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/bodoni-egyptian/|Bodoni Egyptian]]
  and Emigre's [[http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=97|Filosofia]], but the former doesn't
  seem suited for book-length text, and the latter seemed too fancy, for lack of a
  better word.\r\n\r\n<strong>Display & drop caps</strong>\r\nThis largely depends
  on the text decision, but taken in isolation I'm thinking about Dear Sarah for display.
  For the drop caps, if I stick with a Bodoni, I'm inclining towards [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/wiescher/bodoni_classic_deco_roman/|Bodoni
  Classic Deco]], to avoid juxtaposing modern and non-modern letterforms so close
  together. Also because it looks nice :)\r\n\r\nI await your thoughts eagerly..."

    for the text face.\r\nThat would require some serious metafonting.\r\n\r\nThe
    other poems are in italic, so that's important too.\r\n\r\nAlso the relationship
    between the type and illustrations is crucial.\r\nTenniel's went very well with
    a Scotch."

    challenge. Though I hear you on the italics needing to be nice.\r\n\r\nThe more
    I look at Clifford, the more I think I should perhaps give it a second chance.
    Not sure what would complement it as a display face though."

  body: "I have a Puffin edition of the book, first published in the 1940s, then reissued
    in the 1960s, which is nicely set in Monotype Scotch Roman, a type that, altought
    cut in the early 1800s, seems to fit well with Carrol's Victorian mood. But I'm
    not sure that the current digital version is sturdy enough. If you want a contemporary
    usable Scotch, you can't go wrong with Miller; olther choices would be Nick Shinn's
    Scotch Modern and James Mosley's New Scotch (which I don't think is available
    for licensing, anyway). Also Hercules, by Franti\u0161ek \u0160torm, comes to
    mind.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/miller/\r\n\r\nhttp://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007/02/scotch-roman.html\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-19-hercules"

    Coen Hofmann's [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/urw/sax_volume_ot_std/|Sax]],
    which lacks the optical scaling of the former (which would come in handy for the
    Mouse's Tale as Nick perhaps was implying), but does have small caps I would find
    handy. And I agree, the digital MT Scotch Roman is underwhelming.\r\n\r\nAnd I
    like Miller, but I think I'm going for a period look now, and it looks too contemporary
    (my immediate reaction when I see it is \"Boston Globe\"). Hercules I considered,
    but I couldn't swallow its idiosyncrasies, like the \"d\" glyph.\r\n\r\nIt probably
    goes without saying that \"Dear Sarah\" is right out :)"

    of the biggest problems I have with the latter, for this book, is the italic v

    In your above examples, the feeling of Nick's Scotch Modern looks perfect to me

    in color. I don't know how it sets at small sizes, but as Nick has a text size,
    I assume it would work well, so long as it is not too tiny. Also, how much is
    in italic? I would think the roman is more important. "

    harder to put my finger on why. It seems too relaxed, or something. The \"R\"

    higher cost, frankly \u2013 I gave myself a moratorium on major font purchases
    a couple weeks ago until this project launches. Perhaps I'll go with Sax and \"upgrade\"
    to Scotch Modern later on. It's print on demand, so that would be feasible."

    a detailed comparison, but I haven't noticed any differences so far."

  body: Zach - not a difference in terms of quality *per se* but in terms of result,
    meaning how typefaces look on paper when printed digitally and offset. In my experience,
    digital print can achieve great results (considering its low cost), but, generally
    speaking, tyepaces look "thinner" and "colder" (I don't know a better espression,
    sorry) than in offest printing. So, a sturdier, less contrasted typeface could
    work well in digital print too.

    print (fist picture) has a tendency to \"dry\" the type (hence my \"colder\" and
