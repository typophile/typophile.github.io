  <BR>I&#39;m mainly looking for sans-serif letters that have have a slightly worn,
  broken-in quality &#40;like wood or lead type that has seen better days&#41;. Also,
  they should be readable at smaller text sizes. The example that I&#39;ve attached
  has slightly rounded corners. I&#39;d appreciate any recommendations for similar
  typefaces as well.
