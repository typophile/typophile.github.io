  body: "Other than the NovelFonts version from the mid-90's (which I have), the only
    other digital version of Richmond Oldstyle that I know is Joe Treacy's [[http://www.treacyfaces.com/050806_TFWembley_2c5a.html|Wembley]],
    which is not condensed. If you just need a few words set in it, contact me and
    I can do it for you.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
