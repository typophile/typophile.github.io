<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Can I get some opinions about something I've been thinking about for awhile?... <br> <br>A typeface optimally tuned for foreign-language dictionaries; here are some of the primary concerns that I can see: <br> <br>1) Length of reading time. This depends on the kind of reading (definitely not long-term literature reading, but 2 or 3 pages of speed reading, or "speed-glancing", in order to find the desired item, which leads us into #2). <br> <br>2) Vertical, rather than horizontal, reading. This poses the biggest question to me... the vertical motion is similar to that which we experience while browsing a scrolling website (which, of course, uses a sanserif--could any respectable work on paper use sanserif and be taken seriously?) <br> <br>I believe typefaces with heavy or bulky serifs make a dictionary's usability difficult (it's an industry concerned way more with content than practical aesthetics). I wonder, what about a face with soft serifs (that is, something less obtrusive than, say, the in-your-face serifs of an "s" in Times Roman), something somewhere just on the edge of having no serifs at all...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Lexicon--looks like a nice face; to be honest I was unaware of its existence until you pointed it out, so thanks Victor. But the post wasn't a riddle, I can see the cryptic tone after looking at it now. What I really want is some opinion on what might work best (or better than that used currently) in dictionaries, especially foreign-language dictionaries, and specifically dictionaries covering indigenous languages of the Americas. <br> <br>Having worked directly in the field of lexicography for the past 3 or 4 years (and still going--much to the dismay of my eyes!), I've noticed the distinct tendency on the part of publishers to give a dictionary's typeface very little thought at all. I believe the criteria at present is the same as any other work of literature--and this just isn't right. <br> <br>Just wanted to pool the "in-the-know" expertise of typophiles. And of course, theoretical arguments between Hrant Papazian and John Hudson on legibility are welcome.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Involved arguments from me (theoretical, rhetorical, gastronomical, any kind really :-) will have to wait until July 6, but what I can advise is to read anything you can find by Paul Luna, a major heavy at Oxford Dictionary, and a devout typophile. FYI, Luna is a big fan of Unger's work, but also recommends good 'ol Nimrod as a fallback. <br> <br>As for multi-script work, you're right, there's a huge lack of thoughtfulness and quality, and you can't blame the typographers entirely, because they lack the "tools" (ie fonts) to do it right. <br> <br><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome1.html target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome1.html</a> <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>So much depends on the size/leading of the type (ie, how much does the publisher want to minimize the number of pages), and the paper stock. <br> <br>My old Penguin Dictionary from the '60s is set in 7/7 Plantin, and the stock is little better than newsprint, but the general effect is excellent (were it not disintegrating). <br> <br>Chris Burke's new "Celeste Text" looks quite interesting for small size work.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have designed two dictionnaries with last winter using some newspapers fonts that I have designed 10 years ago. I see good similarities in booth medium: narrow columns, hierarchy, strong contrast between various elements, economy, small sizes used, etc. <br> <br><a href=http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeJournal target=_blank>http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeJournal</a> <br><a href=http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeSans target=_blank>http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeSans</a> <br><a href=http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeJournalIpa target=_blank>http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeJournalIpa</a> <br> <br>If interested, I be will be probably able to post some images of the results on the web. <br> <br>"ie, how much does the publisher want to minimize the number of pages" <br> <br>At my big surprize, the publisher wanted more pages than what my fonts and design proposed: to give to the potential buyer the feeling that he got heavy, so a complete dictionnary. If it was too light and thin, the future reader "impression on the object" can be very wrong: "Hey, for the same price between two dictionnaries, this one is more heavy and features more pages, its better one for sure!"</div>
