body: "Greetings everyone,\r\nMy instructor recommended this forum to me. I'm here
  to ask for some general advice. What in your experience has turned out to be a waste
  of time in the creative process? What are some things I might avoid that can prevent
  me from being productive? Are there any well known situations that could cause me
  to slow down?\r\nI do everything on the computer but attending classes now I am
  being persuaded to do more of my preliminary work by hand until the concept is more
  developed. Has anyone else struggled with this? Having grown up making art entirely
  on the computer I personally find it hard to do even simple things by hand.\r\nI\u2019m
  just looking for your thoughts, feelings and opinions.\r\nThank you\r\nScott / BigBeard\r\n"

    every day, every chance you get, and draw everything. Like anything worth achieving,
    it takes time, so don''t get discouraged. '

  body: I grew up in the pre-computer era and drew a lot as a child, so I'm comfortable
    with a pencil and paper. But as a designer, I don't do a lot of detailed sketches
    -- it's usually just a quick way to see how to distribute things on a page, or
    how a multi-story page will flow, or a way of quickly comparing two approaches.
    The sketches themselves rarely need to look attractive or polished. They're just
    a scribbly shorthand for your ideas.

  body: A pencil is like a computer or a piano or a telescope in that it is an instrument
    that you might employ to give voice and range to your imagination. And one ought
    to worry less about performace or quality at the outset and more about simply
    establishing a healthy relationship with drawing in which you find it purely enjoyable.
    It may not seem like it, but going to life drawing sessions is a great introduction
    to the orchestrations of seeing, thinking and sketching. I know with certainty
    that drawing all the time enriches my own approach to design, but that is very,
    very far down on the list of reasons why I do it.

  body: "At the art school I'm attending, I'm also told many times I need to draw
    and make more sketches. The concept is the most important thing, they say. Which
    is of course the truth. However, when I look around at some of my fellow students;
    some of them can draw their ideas quite nicely, but afterwards, they do not have
    the skills to finalize their ideas on the computer. Which renders their ideas
    useless to them.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying the drawing part is obsolete, but it is
    not everything.\r\nBut of course, it is good to at least be able to make quick
    and comprehensive sketches, even if it's just to communicate your idea to someone
    else in a quick way. Before you spend alot of time making something on the computer,
    finding out the person you are making it for, doesn't even like the basic idea
    to begin with."

  body: "For about a year I would rarely sketch concepts before going to the computer.
    Since I started sketching again recently, I've had greater success in my designs.
    I think sketching allows me to play and also rid my mind of all the bad ideas
    more quickly.\r\n\r\nthe students who are creating fully rendered sketches are
    doing it all wrong. Make a mess! Loosen up. The sketching part of the process
    should be playful and the sketches should be <strong>very</strong> rough."

  body: "I learned design pre-computer when we had to sketch and (as much as possible)
    realize our ideas before committing to type. Type was very expensive and we did
    not have the luxury of fiddling around until it looked right. So we had to try
    to \"see\" the concept before we put our ideas into type. My boss, from those
    days, could spec every element of the design on a piece of vellum and when we
    ordered the type he was rarely, if ever, off in his measurements and specs.\r\n\r\nI
    would never go back to those days - and in fact don't do a lot of drawing anymore
    - but consider this period of my design development/education extremely valuable.
    I encourage you to try sketching now, while you're in school. Even now, I think
    my brain is still programmed to try to visualize what I want to do before I open
    up a page and start designing."

  body: "The conflict between design methods based on drawing/visualization and the
    new methods was brought up in Communication Arts 347, September/October 2006,
    pp. 22-27. For me the key paragraph was:\r\n\r\n\u201CChristoper Vice, designer
    and teacher at Indiana University Herron School of Art and Design, says, in spite
    of the fact that technology is incorporated into the curriculum, \u201CMost design
    school are still approaching the teaching of design the same way they did 50 years
    ago. Like exceptions such as Art Center College in Pasadena, IIT (Illinois Institute
    of Technology), University of Illinois at Chicago, and Herron, design schools
    need to rewrite their curriculum following a model of relevancy.\u201C\r\n\r\nI
    like drawing and sketching, but I often don't need to do it, and I can often knock
    out better sketches by screwing around in Illustrator or Indesign than I can with
    a heap of tracing paper and a light table. This is a big issue for me because
    during the previous semester my core design class revolved around concept and
    tracing-paper process. It didn't go well for me, and I really only got work that
    I liked when I just ignored the instructor and put the paper away. "

  body: "Employing an experimental approach throughout my design education (originally
    as a student of illustration) allowed me to explore what was intuitive in terms
    of mark making, ideas development, etc. Even now, I find myself using found objects
    such as feathers and sticks to dip into Indian ink for lettering, mark making
    and drawing. Indeed anything that makes a good mark. Depending on the nature of
    the design brief, I will sometimes develop ideas pencil to paper and some directly
    on the computer, usually a mixture of the two. For a design student and <a href=http://www.twitchspeed.com/site/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.htm>\u2018digital
    native\u2019</a> like yourself, I think it is invaluable to try many different
    processes and approaches until you find one that is comfortable for you; one that
    is not unnaturally forced or laboured.\r\n\r\nFurther to what James has previously
    mentioned: Swanson (Heller's, Education of a Graphic Designer) makes an interesting
    point, stating that, \"by teaching what they were taught, [design educators are]
    teaching the graphic designers of the twenty-first century how to be mid-twentieth
    century graphic designers.\""

  body: "In my experience hiring young designers who cut their teeth on the Mac, I
    do think something gets lost when you are not taught to try to visualize the design
    problem and solution before you boot up your computer. I remember one assistant
    whose computer was down and she came to me and said \"I can't work\". I threw
    some type books and a pad of paper at her and told her work up some ideas. I think
    she hated me.\r\n\r\nNo doubt schools need to adapt their teaching methods to
    the new technology and there's no need to force students to learn the waxer and
    the ruling pen. The best instructors will teach their students the to think visually
    and conceptually with or without a computer screen in front of them, and be flexible
    in their approach to the problem."

    understand and agree, however, I think that some design professors get hung up
    on the words of Glaser and Fletcher when it comes to typography, and expect students
    to work in the old ways while ignoring the possibility that a computer is still
    just a tool, and thus can be just as useful for visualization as pen and pad. "

  body: "When I studied calligraphy and book design with Friedrich Neugebauer back
    in the 1970s, he insisted that I take figure-drawing classes (his workshop was
    part of a much larger college of artistic and industrial design). Having grown
    up in an architect's office, I was very comfortable with T-square, french curves,
    technical pens, etc. but <em> terrified</em> of free drawing. So I felt that the
    time would be better spent if I did more lettering instead. However, he persisted,
    I acquiesced and went to drawing, and gradually I realized that doing this was
    a way to approach qualities of line, gesture, the nature of curves, light and
    dark, from a different vantage point. He encouraged me to work on litho stones
    as well. \r\n\r\nI do not make figure drawings for the work that I produce, but
    the process certainly was very enlightening and I see now the wisdom of Friedrich's
    direction. Even if they are not part of my working outward expression, these drawings
    are indeed a part of my foundation and instincts. \r\n\r\nI don't know if this
    is helpful to you as you struggle with hand work, but it certainly seems worth
    trying some more."

  body: "Scott,\r\n\r\nI agree with those that say sketching on paper is still the
    best way to flesh out ideas quickly. As someone who never went to design school,
    I still fall into the trap of going to the computer to quickly to try and make
    a weak concept work. I end up wasting time fleshing out a concept that was not
    going to work to begin with.\r\n\r\nI would recommend www.illustrationclass.com
    by Von Glitschka. Though it is more focused on illustration instead of type design,
    there are numerous downloads where Von goes through his process from sketching
    to computer. I think it is a great resource. He even has examples from other illustrators/designers
    so you can see their process as well.\r\n"
