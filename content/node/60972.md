  excited to see that one of the first projects I've gotten to work on while working
  at Pentagram has been posted on their [[http://pentagram.com/en/new/2009/08/preview-fifa-world-cup-us-bid.php|blog]].
  I've been designing this custom typeface under the creative direction of Michael
  Gericke and Luke Hayman.\r\n\r\nIt's currently being used on [[http://www.gousabid.com/page/invite/trailer|the
  GoUsaBid.com]] site. I've been incredibly excited to see what the talented designers
  at Pentagram are doing with the typeface. Look forward to a future Pentagram blog
  post with all the applications of the bid message and 'Game' typeface.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n[[http://rbtl.us|Read

  body: As a currently slightly disappointed after yesterday's result US Soccer fan,
    I saw the site posted on a soccer blog yesterday and checked it out briefly. Definitely
    a unique look, and good to see our national team becoming more design aware/focused
    ([[http://www.ussoccer.com|ussoccer.com]] was also just redesigned). Nice work,
    I'll definitely be keeping an eye on the blog.

  body: You were actually really good. They constantly get people up there who have
    nothing interesting to say, so your material was great. And that font is great,
    BTW. Any change you can show us a complete character set?

    are a lot of printed materials being designed right now that use the typeface
