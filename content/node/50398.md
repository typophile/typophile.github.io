  35 years:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pexto2_4306.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's my
  turn to clean up around it, and I'm just getting crouched down to sweep underneath,
  and the nameplate stares me in the face:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pexto_4317.jpg]\r\n\r\nWow!
  it's beautiful, right down to the red paint behind the brand name. I probably haven't
  looked at it since I was 3 or 4 years old, when it was at my eye level. Now I'm
  off to document the machine plates off the other old equipment we have around, though
  I'm certain this one is the oldest. "
