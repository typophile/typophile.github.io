body: "I am thinking about purchasing a set of Futura.\r\nWhich foundry should I go
  for? What is your preferred version, and why?\r\n\r\nI was thinking of going with
  a [[http://www.linotype.com/247688/futura1-valuepack.html|Futura Value Pack from
  Linotype]] (about $150 6 fonts in 3 weights), but then I saw the  [[http://www.myfonts.com/products/bitstream/cambridge|Cambridge
  CD set from Bitstream]]\r\nand since it has a total of 200 fonts for only $199,
  I thought it was a great deal. \r\n\r\nI am trying to build my font library at home
  for freelance projects, and Futura is a face I like to use frequently at work. I
  currently don't have a huge need for any special character sets, so I am leaning
  toward the Bitstream set since it includes many other fonts my library lacks. I
  wasn't sure if the price difference was simply because of the more limited character
  set, or if there is a quality difference between the foundries.\r\n\r\nThanks! I
  value your opinions, and any guidance you can give."

    I searched the forums for \"Best Futura\" Or either I am going crazy.\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone have anything against the Bitstream version? I would hate to get it and
    then be regretful.\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"
