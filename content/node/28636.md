body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm just about to start the design of a book about Atlantis (the
  lost city with advanced technology and culture of the greek mythology). It's not
  an absolute scientific stlye, more like a travelogue. It has a LOT of pictures,
  so there isn't any too long textblocks. The author takes it a bit more serious than
  it actually is (he isn't an archeologist, or anything similar to that), however
  it do seem to be exciting and he refers to a lot of fact..\r\n\r\nSo my problem
  is about choosing the right shape of his voice. I've been looking for the right
  typeface for some days now, altough i wouldn't mention any of them, because i'm
  more interested in what others would think of. I don't really have a lot of time
  for the full design so that's why I ask for your suggestions.\r\n\r\nPlease share
  your toughts. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nIstv\xE1n\r\n\r\n"

  body: What's the target audience? And does the author just take the book itself
    seriously, or does he actually believe in Atlantis and want it treated with the
    gravity a lost civilization would deserve?

    body: He certainly believes in it, and he also has an alternate theory in some
      of the details. The book can be taken seriously if you are open to the subject.
      The target audience is about everyone who has any interest in this subject which
      is actually still quite popular.
