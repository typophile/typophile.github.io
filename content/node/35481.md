  things proceed on schedule, Adobe hopes to release AFDKO 2.0 around February, and
  then have an AFDKO 2.x release around the end of the summer. That latter release
  will support mark attachment (and all OpenType lookup types), at which point FontLab
  and FontMaster will have the source code to do the same.\"\r\n\r\nIs there any news
  on the 2.x front? In particular I'm interested in the currently unsupported features
  of the OpenType Feature File Specification such as those mentioned in the above
  quote.\r\n\r\nAny news will be greatly appreceiated!\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\nIdris"

    (or will it be 3.0?) release than the 2.0 release that already happened.\r\n\r\nThere
    are some real uncertainties right now in work that Read will be doing before the
    work on the next big FDK release. I would bet that it will not ship for at *least*
    three months, and quite possible a fair bit longer than that.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    the fea file, hence the impatience).\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\nI"
