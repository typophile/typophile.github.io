body: Logo for a jewelry shop.  <BR> <BR>Not many clues, just that it is  <BR>a gallery
  that exhibits top quality piecies  <BR>from Gavello to small workshops around Greece.
  <BR> <BR>So, the prices are not always high,  <BR>but what it matters is the good
  taste  <BR>and the carefull selection of the exhibits. <BR> <BR>Here are the first
  roughs. I didn&#39;t work much  <BR>on the colors but i would like to avoid  <BR>the
  black-gold clic

  body: HI Christos, perhaps you could give us a few more samples, as there is only
    enough here to keep me busy comparing logos for a few hours. Seriously, these
    are great. I have a few favorites such as 2A, 3A, 6 series, 8. Best would properly
    be a even bet on 6A and 8. Series 10 doesn&#39;t do much for me.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Why don&#39;t you try some other font for 1a, something
    straight &amp; sans, like &#40;Avenir?&#41; in the 2a.  <BR> <BR>Quality stuff,
    I must say <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: 'From the choices you provided I like 1a, 2b, 3a. The symbol at #10 is very
    obscure, but if that was your idea, it is ok. Number 9 looks drastically modern
    to me and won&#39;t work for a gallery. #7 and #8 are pleasing, however, with
    a chinese tint. The symbols of #6 series are very welcoming, but you should work
    on the font choice. I like #5 least. Number 4 has some potential. <BR>   From
    the choices I prefer 1a. <BR> <BR>In general, this work is outstanding. <BR> <BR>Salute'

  body: 'Dana, I don&#39;t know why you would hesitate on #3. I think the mark in
    #3 is the strongest design on this spread. <BR> <BR>Christos, do you have the
    flexibility to alter the title of the gallery as you have in #3? If so, this mark
    is excellent, but I&#39;m not sold on any of the type selections/layouts. If the
    title is not alterable as shown, then maybe you  can create a similar mark with
    an &#34;M-G&#34; combo. <BR> <BR>Great Work! <BR>Scott'

  body: 1a and series 3 are the strongest in my opinion. although i agree with scott,
    i think you need more work on the type selections--none of them are quit &#34;fitting&#34;
    yet. great start so far!

  body: Thank you all for the immediate response. I really had a lot of ideas  <BR>about
    this project and that gives you a hard time with all that logos. <BR>I also found
    it difficult to decide which way to go &#40;luckily there is a client to make
    the choice&#41;. <BR> <BR>About the font variations i really went a long way before
    i conclude to those i show.  <BR>Of course millions of better choices could be
    done, but right now i want a first choice  <BR>from the client, so then i can
    move on in more details about typography. <BR> <BR>Personally i would pick 1a,
    3a,  4a and maybe 10. <BR> <BR>About the last one the concept is the generic image
    i have in my mind about jewel.  <BR>I was thinking that the shape is not that
    important as the way it will be applied  <BR>on different objects. I send a photo
    with a first trial on this direction to describe what i mean. <BR> <BR>christos

  body: I love 7, 8, alot of 3 &#40;especially 3a&#41; and I like 10 - I think it
    is very clean and unique in a world of all capital serifs that is usually used
    in the industry. It feels very boutique. the mark on 8 is just killer!

    would like to see 9, I can see it working with clean designs.

  body: Christos, if you ever have blown-out highlights on your jewlery and want to
    add back some color I have a tip. Change the mode of your photoshop file from
    RGB to LAB and add a layer in color mode and color the blown-out highlight. Then
    convert it to CMYK, it works. I read the article in Photoshop User magazine and
    still don't understand the technical reason it works but it does.
