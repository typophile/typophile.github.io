  long for them to approve me and I need an answer sooner.\r\n\r\nMy client needs
  to convert some PostScript Type 1 fonts into OpenType Fonts.\r\n\r\nThe fonts they
  have don't contain kerning tables. That kerning information is contained in an external
  database that applies the kerning when the character are set in a very old proprietary
  typesetting system.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if Font Lab Studio (or another product)
  will automate applying the kerning tables into an OpenType font.\r\n\r\nWe can convert
  the existing tables into just about any format that is necessary."

    you import the features using the OpenType panel, not the Metrics Window.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have already written the other features, write them off, add the kerning in
    the proper syntax, & (re)import the whole thing.\r\n\r\nexample of \"kerning as

  body: "FontLab Studio is also able to link to external .FEA files in the Adobe FDK
    syntax. \r\n\r\nProduce a text file that looks like following: \r\n\r\n<code>feature
    kern {\r\n   pos A quoteright -111;\r\n   pos A comma 19;\r\n   pos A period 19;\r\n
    \  pos A colon 19;\r\n   pos A semicolon 19;\r\n   pos A T -83;\r\n   pos A U
    -42;\r\n   pos A V -120;\r\n} kern;</code>\r\n\r\nand save the file as <code>kerning.fea</code>
    in the <code>Features</code> folder inside of your Studio 5 user folder (see the
    manual for specific locations). \r\n\r\nIn the lower-right part of the OpenType
    panel, place a line such as\r\n\r\n<code>include(kerning.fea);</code>\r\n\r\nWhen
    you generate an OpenType font, it'll have the OpenType kerning as specified there.
    This way, you LINK the kerning to the VFB file, not IMPORT. To import, you need
    to open the .fea features file from the OpenType panel. \r\n\r\nYou can also import
    the kerning in the AFM file using the Metrics Window in FontLab Studio. \r\n\r\nOf
    course, both OpenType kerning and AFM kerning can be imported into the font using
    FontLab Studio's Python scripting language in a fully automated manner. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam

    while the second won't. This means that if you use 2) you won't see any kerning
    or be able to edit the kerning in the Metrics Window. In addition, if the Preferences
    are set to \"Generate the OpenType 'kern' feature if it is undefined or outdated\",
    the code added in 2) will be blown away and probably replaced by an empty 'kern'
    feature."

    import the kerning data via a kern feature, and remember NOT to *update* the kerning
    feature when you generate an .otf font, then if in FontLab you open the .otf font
    you've just generated (rather than the .vfb where you did the work), the kerning
    will be \"in the font\" -- e.g., you can write off an .afm, etc. You could, if
    you wished, then reset the classes & features & start afresh, use the metrics
    window, etc.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you are going to go this far, it is simpler
    to do as Miguel suggests and simply generate an .afm, add the kerning with the
    correct syntax for an .afm, and read it back in.\r\n\r\nBTW, If the kerning is
    from Quark, as I remember you have to multiply all the values by eight."

  body: This is interesting. I was preparing to use Volt to add a vertical positioning
    feature to my Arabic font; it is to lower vowel marks by a given amount when they
    follow a member of a class of base glyphs. However I would prefer to do it within
    the Fontlab workflow - can I just type it in as a new <pos> feature, and if so
    what is the syntax? Would the effect be seen in a Quick Test?  Thanks for your
    help with this.

    Layout support is based do not support mark attachment or adjustment. The only
    GPOS supported is pair kerning.

    Ubuntu Linux installed on a PC) for Arabic positioning and other features?

    will show when  tables are functional and not merely displayed in the OT panel
    without actually working in the Metrics panel, and more importantly in the generated
    font."
