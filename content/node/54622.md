    think. Get the promo piece if you can.  It is often that question of what\u2019s
    not to like. In this case I see nothing. God I sound negative."

  body: You mean the specimen booklet? I got that a while ago too. It's high on my
    "look at these frequently, and buy as soon as you find a project that may fit"

  body: I do agree... $145 is a lot. I was just being silly posting the per character
