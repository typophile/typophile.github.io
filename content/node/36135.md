  am currently designing an advert in which the headline copy is a transcript from
  a phone conversation. Initially I thought about a handwritten typeface to make it
  look more relaxed, informal, etc. Most typefaces that I found are not quite right
  as they are too stylised or the balance between the characters are too eratic.\r\n\r\nSo
  The question I am setting...\r\n\r\n<strong>Can anyone recommend a typeface that
  'looks' spoken?</strong>\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nJavier\r\n\r\n"

    closely before you get it, but you might find something you like in there.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I like <a href=\"http://dafont.com/komika-hands.font\">Komika Hands</a>. Mmmm

  body: "Yes, you  could graph the waveform of a voice recording and adjust the height
    and width of the letters in the text to the corresponding shapes, I'm not sure
    a handwritten font would work so well for that, though. A boxy sans might be easier
    to deal with.\r\n\r\nWith some sophisticated scripting, you might be able to use
    the sound data directly in modifying type, in which case use whatever style of
    letter you like. I'm no programmer so don't ask me how you would do this."

  body: "\"Can anyone recommend a typeface that \u2019looks\u2019 spoken?\"\r\nThe
    short answer is, any typeface that has quotation marks would do something of the
    sort (so to speak). \"Does this look spoken?\" Hope so.:) Sure, you can throw
    a speech balloon around anything and make it \"spoken\" as well... or can you?...
    There is a much longer answer that goes back to the notion that all type selection
    is a choice between one \"tone of voice\" and another. This has broken up a bit
    with the advent of fonts popular because they include in their design predefined
    faults associated with poor output (grunge) or limited compositional capabilities
    (monospace or stencil). Some of the examples above with grunge in a balloon make
    the point quite well that the more personality in the design, the less range of
    spoken word can be effectively carried, even <em>with</em> a balloon. Another
    example of this would be to visualize the stencil font appearing elsewhere on
    your screen in either quotes or a balloon. How many tones of voice would that
    carry effectively? So what looks spoken? Or what doesn't look spoken? Point size
    and other composition requirements are important obviously, but just what tone
    of voice is to be conveyed should be explained before a range of choices could
    possibly be explored, in my opinion. If on the other hand a speech balloon is
    inevitable, then comic book lettering is going to be the choice through sheer
    familiarity of the user.\r\n\r\n\"...speak into a mic and see what comes out...\"
    lol, good luck. Or I should say, reverse it (at least in your mind), and try making
    a tone of voice for just a few 1000 fonts.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
