  body: 'It looks hand drawn to me. It would be especially likely if this logo has
    been around for a long time. One thing that makes me think it is hand drawn is
    the apostrophe. It''s not the kind of apostrophe that would work, say, between
    capital letters, which is the standard approach with fonts. There is also something
    slightly uneven about the way the characters are drawn; the way the bowls on the
    a and b differ, for instance. '

      me that the bowls on the a + b are different. \r\nthanks for the feedback. I'm
      going to have to find a more high-res image  and try to work from that."
