body: I am in the process of building a website. I only recently learned about Google
  Fonts, and I like the idea of using a web-based font. Is using these fonts a good
  idea? I'd like to hear the pros and cons from people who have used webfonts. Also,
  are there any other places that have webfonts other than Google Fonts? Thank you
  kindly.

    may also be possible to host webfonts yourself. The abovementioned services may
    allow so (I haven\u2019t checked). Freely-available fonts, other than Google\u2019s,
    often have to be self-hosted anyway."
