  body: "\"Stop doing that\": I believe in bitmaps instead. But I do do hinting\r\nas
    needed, or as paid. :-)  Heck I'd even shoot you if you paid me to.*\r\nWell,
    no, but you know what I mean.\r\n\r\n* Who hasn't seen the amazing movie \"White\"?
    Go rent it.\r\n\r\n> over your quota.\r\n\r\nActually that's a feature not a bug.
    \ :-)\r\nMy TMF mailbox is indeed full, full of 10 tons of sludge (spam), which
    however I don't have the heart to just delete en masses, being a firm believer
    in the Happy Accident. The good news is that although the mail doesn't get stored
    over there it does get forwarded to my \"real\" email address (where Gmail does
    an incredible job filtering the sludge). Plus the sender is automatically notified
    to look harder for a better email for me, so it's really the best of both worlds!
    \ :-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I will reply to your (nicely surprising) email ASAP.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
