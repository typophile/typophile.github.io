  Aldo as a subheading. Aldo only has a semibold style. I went through all my fonts
  and I don't really like any of them as far as going with this one. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nFont

  body: You can thin it up in InDesign etc., by applying a tiny stroke value, in the
    background color.

  body: "One caveat with this -- if it's going to an offset printer, as with a book,
    their preflight program will usually squawk about any stroke less then .25 points,
    and they'll usually hold up the job until they get an answer back. For that reason,
    we don't do employ this technique, except to make a faux bold from a roman, where
    .25 points is just about right. \r\n\r\nWe never tried to tell the printer \"it's
    OK, go ahead\" (publisher objected, with I think good reason)  so I don't know
    the complete answer. And of course, if you're not putting ink on paper, preflight
    programs won't matter -- though for all I know, there are other programs that
    will just ignore any fine strokes."
