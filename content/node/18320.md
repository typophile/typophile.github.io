  I am using Hoefler and Frere-Jones' <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/mercurydisplay/index.html\">Mercury
  Display</a> and <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/mercurytext/index.html\">Mercury
  Text</a> throughout, but I would like to compliment these by using a sans serif
  font for subheadings, captions, etc. Suggestions?"

    body: The booklet highlights each college of the university, discussing the academic
      aspect, and talks about the areas in which the university excels. It will be
      sent out to other colleges and universities.

  body: This isn't very helpful, but nearly anything with the weights and styles (italics,
    small caps) you need will work with Mercury. Maybe start with some sans faces
    you like and we can offer suggestions from there.

  body: "Since your budget allowed for Mercury, perhaps you could go for:\r\n\r\nIF
    friendly, TRY Whitney\r\nIF modern, TRY Gotham\r\nIF corporate, TRY Unit\r\n\r\nAs
    it highlight each school within the university I'd just question if the university
    hopes friendly, modern or corporate. Once you can tell us which one of those we
    might be able to narrow it down.  "

  body: "Garth, I second Tiffany's recommendations. Gotham and Whitney were both published
    by Hoefler & Frere-Jones, the minds behind Mercury. You can't do too much better.
    (Unless your budget has been blown on Mercury. ;-)\r\n\r\nUnit is also a great
    and very useful typeface from the rockstar duo of Erik Spiekermann on vocals and
    bass, and Christian Schwartz on lead guitar. \r\n\r\nAnd if you stick around for
    a few hours some type designers will stop by and suggest their own work.\r\n"
