body: "I teach design at a local arts college. I needed a font for movie poster credits
  and need to be able to extensively modify the font when needed. I decided, for copyright
  reasons, to make my own. In that case, I could modify away and if the font got out
  \"into the wild\" by accident, it copyright would not be an issue. I thought I would
  allow edu free use.\r\n\r\nI've never been happy with the various highly condensed
  sans faces. I'm not sure why. dugud is in it's early stages. Kerning has not yet
  been started. As I see the font, I think I'll produce a much thinner version as
  a companion font.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may.\r\n\r\nWhatdayathink?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDoug\r\n\r\n"

    modify one that's already in the public domain?\r\nhttp://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/7-league-gothic"

  body: The tails (a,q,Q,u) feel a little too hesitant. It the form is going to be
    different, then make the difference more pronounced. Any anomaly in this geometric
    font is going to be very noticeable, so make them look more intentional. See how
    the a and d baseline regions look eerily similar, yet noticeably different. I
    think these tails could extend a little further past the stem's vertical.

  body: "Thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nriccard0\r\nI hadn't thought of modifying
    a public domain font. Well, I got the practice anyway. It was quite fun and it's
    not over yet.\r\n\r\nEric\r\nThanks. Very insightful. Yes, I was thinking that
    the Q,q,u might be a problem. What do you mean by intentional if I may ask? Should
    I drop the swash on the q and go with a reflected p? I tried the u in the manner
    of an upsidedown n (with tweaks). Perhaps I should go back to that thinking?\r\n\r\nWonderful
    feedback, just what I needed.\r\n\r\nDoug"

  body: Yeah, sorry. "Intentional" is a very intangible description. I think the tails
    there should extend out further...dare-I-say Helvetica-like? (see the Helvetica
    a) This may infringe on some of the white-space next to the stems of a,q,u, but
    you can make optical corrections when you set the body width. Just my thoughts...and
    in regards to riccard0's comment, I definitely understand the motivation behind
    starting a font from scratch; it can be a fun learning exercise!

  body: "Eric\r\nOK. I don't have time to revise today but I'd really like to run
    variation by you. I'll get something together tomorrow and perhaps you could comment?
    Thanks for the clarification on the \"intentional\". Not 100% sure I get it but
    I do get it to 75% anyway. If I do a revise I may understand better.\r\n\r\nDoug"

  body: I think the A is too wide; it definitely breaks the rhythm in your sample.

  body: "The tail of lowercase q is interesting can something like that \r\nbe applied
    to more characters. Also cap K looks very congested.\r\n \r\nIt will be difficult
    to get this to look different from the \r\nmany sans condensed faces already out
    there but is is well drawn."
