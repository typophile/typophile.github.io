		<div class="commentbody">I doubt seriously that anyone reads an annual report in the same way as they read a book.  They might scan the text and focus on the financial statement tabular material to find what interests them.   <BR>The type of an annual report should reflect the company it is for. Think of the difference between Ben&amp;Jerry's, IBM, Avon, Harley-Davidson, Disney, Whole Foods, IKEA, Victoria's Secret, Colt Firearms, Smuckers, and John Deere. <BR>I have asked on this forum how much difference does the cold hard data show in readability between a good sans and a good serif face and never been answered.  I am looking for a usable measure like: &quot;Serif face x has been proven to reduce reading time for a 100 page continuous text book (a novel) by 5% over sans serif face y.&quot; <BR>We all have our personal favorites and those we hate.  I get a headache when reading more than a paragraph of Optima.  I love the way Bodoni looks in large sizes but tire of reading it in long text.  My 2 favorite text fonts to read are Adobe Garamond and FF Din&ndash;find me the logic in that pairing. I don't claim to be typical of the majority of readers and don't cram my favorites down my client's throats.  <BR>Unlike several years ago when there were far fewer choices, today there are thousands of faces and several of them are good. There is one heck of a lot more to readability than sans vs serif.  We don't even know if the serif issue is the most important.  I think leading and line length mean much more but I have no hard data to prove it. <BR> <BR>Oh well, I'll shut up now. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oh yes&ndash;one more thing&ndash;CONTENT!  <BR>The nature of the content has a way of either making us want to read more (if we find it interesting) or making us want to yawn and quit (if we find it boring). <BR>If I ownwd a bunch of stock in a company, I would be interested in the annual report and read it.  If it were a company that was of no interest to me, I would not read it.  This is where design, white space, and photos become a big help.</div>
