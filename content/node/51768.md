body: "I'm looking for a book I borrowed from my last workplace a while back. I'm
  not really looking for the book, only a reference in the book (the author makes
  references to a US stencil company or similar) which I'd really like to research
  for my next project. I think the book was dated around 1950, and was aimed for students
  on typography. \r\n\r\nI've searched amazon and archive.org for the book, but I
  can't seem to find exactly what I'm looking for. \r\n\r\nI have two pictures from
  two different pages in the book, and I'd love if someone could ID the book or give
  me some info on the reference I'm after.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_0223__6106.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC_0229__5467.jpg]\r\n\r\nChristian"
