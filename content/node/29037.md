body: "I'm planning to write a novel in the month of November (NaNoWriMo if any of
  you are familiar with it). I have a Jornada 680e, basically a cute little word processor.
  My main problem, however, is that it only has dumb quotes and dumb double quotes,
  I'd guess you'd say? The ' and \" aren't curled or anything.\r\n\r\nAs I transfer
  it onto my computer / work on the novel on my computer, there's obviously going
  to be a difference in these quotation marks. If anyone's familiar with this and
  knows settings to tweak / any programs, that'd be great! :-)\r\n\r\n-- David"

    the dumb quotes - you can turn off \"smart quotes\" in Word etc.,\r\n\r\nIf you
    want \"smart quotes\" I think you can \"autoformat\" the document to replace the
    straight quotes - if not I'm sure you'll find a macro to do this on the Web.\r\n "
