  evokes the spirit of the Arts and Crafts movement of the 1920s. Think of a hand-cut
  Roman display face, with loving care lavished over each serif and letterform.\r\n\r\nGildersleeve
  is offerered in the classic combination of a regular face, a bold face, an italic
  and an italic bold. Any of them are ideal for poster or cover work, as well as for
  chapter and section headings in a longer document, in combination with a text face
  such as Vertrina or Clementhorpe Text.\r\n\r\nYou can see some examples of Gildersleeve
  in use on our [[http://gatf.wordpress.com | blog]], or try it out for yourself at
  [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/gildersleeve/overview.html | Myfonts.com]].\r\n\r\nIn
  the meantime, here's an example of Gildersleeve in action:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gildersleeve_Gallery4_3432.png]"
