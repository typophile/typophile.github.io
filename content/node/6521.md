body: Ok.. granted I hav not taken a huge amount of time trying to comprehend this
  -- Golden Section -- rule.  But being a man with a seemingly un-annalitical brain,
  I just cant exactly comprehend this.  Could somone spell this out in lamens terms?  All
  I have ever seen written on it is very technical mathmatical expressions. Does anyone
  have any good examples of layouts that comply to the guidlines of the Golden Section??  Would
  love to hear/learn more about this. <BR> <BR>hildebrant. <BR>

    a book: &#34;Geometry in Design&#34; by Kimberly Elam. It&#39;s a &#34;light&#34;
    work, but contains a nice treatment of various geometric &#34;ideals&#34; in design,
    and Nature. Of course it has a section on the Golden Section. <BR> <BR>What bugs
    me about the Golden Section is this: since it deals with proportions of <i>length</i>,
    when you use it for surfaces &#40;like in type design&#41;, do you <i>square-root</i>
    it? I&#39;ve never seen a convincing discussion of that. <BR> <BR>BTW, I also
    have an article from an old issue of PEI &#40;back when they encouraged thinking,
    instead of being a source for Qwik Trix with Fotopix type &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149;&#41;
    that discussed the Golden Section with great insight. But please don&#39;t ask
    me to find it!  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'hmmmm. The golden section is quite a big subject.  <BR>It&#39;s not that
    difficult. &#40;I wrote a paper about it <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> &#41;. Maybe first a link to start: <a href="http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/Fibonacci/phi.html#golden">the
    pages of mr Knott</a>, which have a big deal to say about the golden section,
    and helped me alot.  Non-designed, but filled with information &amp; examples
    on the subject. &#40;I always liked the part about Fibonnacci and his rabbits
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41;
    <BR> <BR>In fact, it is just a proportion of 1 to 1,618.... Some people believe
    this is the &#34;divine proportion&#34; because it appears in nature so often
    &#40;this has rather economical reasons, see Professor Knott&#39;s pages&#41;.
    I think it is rather difficult to apply to design, because of it&#39;s irrational
    nature. Le Corbusier used it to design his buildings &#40;he made a system out
    of it, called &#39;le Modulor&#39;&#41;; Wiedemann used it in his Corporate ACE-typefaces
    &#40;and the Mercedes-star&#41;. Many bookcovers have this proportion also. There
    is alot written about applying this to bookdesign &#40;see Bringhurts &#34;Elements
    of Typography&#34; for instance&#41;, and I think Tschichold studied it and distilled
    a method to apply it to the margins of a page... <BR> <BR>hope this gets you going...'

    &#60;/a&#62; <BR>The ratio of a golden section can be represented by a line bisected
    in such a way that the ratio of the smaller &#34;piece&#34; to the larger piece
    is equal to the ratio of the larger piece to the whole.  <BR> <BR>Sort of like
    this: <BR>----------|------  <BR>&#40;but don&#39;t count those hypens, it can&#39;t
    be shown with whole units - it&#39;s roughly 1:1.6, but really it&#39;s an irrational.'

  body: 'Hrant, you&#39;re to quick for me! Yes &#39;Geometry in Design&#39; is a
    indeed good book for showing some examples of applying the GS. I forgot about
    it ... <BR> <BR>There are many proportion-systems, Palladio used the  proportions
    that are based on the musical harmonies. There is a magnificent book on that &#40;only
    architecture tough&#41; by <b>Rudolf Wittkower</b>: <i>Architectural Principles
    in the Age of Humanism</i> &#40;1949&#41;.  <BR>I think one should just find a
    system &#40;or make up his own&#41; that suits him &#40;and the job&#41; and apply
    that to his design, so you have a certain consistency in your design. '

    a rectangle and sections the longer side   <BR>according to the golden ratio the
    areas you get will still   <BR>be, of course, in the &#40;A&#43;B/A = A/B&#41;
    relationship.  <BR>This is a misleading question. The &#34;visual assessment&#34;
    of   <BR>the relationships of surfaces was not very much the point.   <BR>The
    two more important applications of the golden ratio  <BR>were the golden section
    &#40;=cut&#41; which deals with the   <BR>positioning of an element inside a certain
    width, and the   <BR>golden rectangle, which is a shape. Though the ratio is the   <BR>same,
    these are quite unrelated perceptual experiences.   <BR>Naturally, if the rectangle
    you sectioned above was a   <BR>golden rectangle to begin with, you get a square
    and a   <BR>new golden rectangle, so you begin to tie the loose ends.  <BR>  <BR>Now,
    the mathematical validity of the golden ratio is   <BR>universal, it turns up
    in many natural phenomena &#40;&#42;&#41;,   <BR>etc., but the question is: does
    it have any <i>aesthetic</i>   <BR>validity outside the area of Greek cultural
    influence   <BR>&#40;the so-called &#34;West&#34;&#41;? For instance does it appear
    in   <BR>Islamic &#40;&#42;&#42;&#41; architecture and decoration somehow? &#40;As   <BR>you
    know, the Muslims were the heirs and &#34;keepers&#34; of   <BR>Greek culture
    through the middle ages.&#41; In China? In   <BR>Japan?  <BR>  <BR>For those interested
    in the golden ratio, I recommend a nice   <BR>little book called <i>The Divine
    Proportion</i>, by H.E. Huntley.   <BR>It&#39;s edited by Dover, and not hard
    to find, I think.  <BR>  <BR>&#40;&#42;&#41; <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/science/story/0%2C12450%2C875198%2C00.html"

    The golden ratio is directly related to the pentagon,   <BR>and the Muslims have
    a much greater interest in the octagon,   <BR>AFAIK.'
