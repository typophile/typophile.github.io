body: I'd like to wish a very happy birthday to the designer of <a href="http://typographi.com/001024.php">one
  of my favourite to-be-released typefaces of the moment</a> -- Mr. [[Randy Jones]]
  A.K.A. Aquatoad. I was very fortunate to get a sneak preview of his next project,
  still very much in the works, and it kicks some major booty. This guy's good, <em>very</em>
  good.

  body: Using Eason in <em>Interrobang</em> was a joy. Thank you, Randy, for all you
    bring and will bring to the world of typography. I especially appreciate the way
    you share your knowledge and skills so freely on these boards.

  body: happy birthday, randy. it was a pleasure to meet you in NYC for [[typecon]].
    can't wait till Eason is released. and i hafta agree with stewf, your participation
    on typophile brings the quality level up a notch in every thread you contribute
    to. (hopefully counteracting some of my blather! :^P)

  body: "Hi Everybody.\r\n\r\nThis is an unexpected surprise. Thank you for the birthday
    wishes, and also for the education. I knew very little when I first came across
    the Typophile community. With your help I know more about: what books to read,
    how to draw letters, what websites to visit, and most importantly... how to quibble
    effectively :-)\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as rhythm in type design:\r\nOh
    yes there is.\r\nOh no there isn't.\r\nOh yes there is.\r\nOh no there isn't.\r\nYes
    there is!\r\nIsn't.\r\nIs.\r\nOh look this isn't an argument!\r\nOh yes it is.\r\nNo
    it isn't. It's just contradiction.\r\nIt is not.\r\nYes it is!\r\nNo it isn't!\r\n(ding)\r\nThank
    you that's it.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRandy"
