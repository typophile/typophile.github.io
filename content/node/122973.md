body: "This font is in a new Acura commercial called \"Drive like a boss.\" It flashed
  for a few seconds on screen. I also found a \"making of video\" released by Acura
  on Youtube and it also has the same font with even more characters. I included all
  the possible text from the videos in the image.\r\n\r\nPlease help me identify this
  font. And if you know of similar fonts, please suggest those as well.\r\n\r\nHere
  is the \"making of video\" on youtube:  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jZOJDupNIw]]\r\n\r\nThanks."

    which has a gap in its |R|, but not a similar gap in its |A| nor an |M| whose
    center point clears the baseline."

    body: Thanks for the effort. Its close, but the |M| and |A| are important for
      what I need so Avant Garde won't work in this case.

  body: "Can't agree more with Kevin, very \"Avant-Gard-ish\" or rather Futura with
    some earmarks of Avant-Garde Gothic (open /R, /G...). Wasn't able to spot a match
    either so maybe it'd be not so hazardous to conclude it is bespoke and exclusive
    for Acura which could make sense when talking about (high-end) car manufacturing.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    confirmed. Embedded as webfont on their [[http://www.acura.com/FutureVehiclesILX.aspx|website]]
    under the name of 'Acura bespoke'.\r\n\r\nEDIT2: should have been designed by
    half of VoidWreck [[http://www.voidwreck.com|Karl Nawrot]] for [[http://www.mullen.com/tag/acura|Mullen]]"

    so much. I kept seeing this commercial and it was driving me nuts. I would have
    burned a lot more time on this if it weren't for you.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
