body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nworking on my personal identity and looking for a condensed,
  bold sans serif similar to Knockout. A typeface that has a bit more of a woodtype/vintage
  element (if that makes sense). \r\n\r\nFor example, I am choosing Knockout Bantamweight
  rather than Din Black Condensed or Univers 59 Ultra condensed because of that specific
  element that my 'G' has.\r\n\r\nI'm just looking for some alternatives that can
  work here. Maybe something with a unique uppercase G or something.\r\n\r\nYou're
  also welcome to critique my logo, even though I'm going for something quite minimal.\r\n\r\nThanks!!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dg_4798.jpg]"
