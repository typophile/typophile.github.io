body: "What is your typical process when selecting a name for a typeface you're designing...\r\n<!--break-->\r\nespecially
  one intended for the market? My apologies if this question has previously been posed
  in another forum section or thread; if so, I'd greatly appreciate a link to relevant
  past discussions. \r\n\r\nAt what stage do you select a name for the typeface you're
  developing? Do you place greater value on choosing a name that holds significance
  to you, one that 'feels right' for the characters' forms and/or references the inspiration
  for the face? Or are you primarily concerned with choosing a name that is 'aesthetically
  pleasing' and would stand to appeal to potential consumers? \r\n\r\nI'm a few months
  into work on a face and selecting a name for it has been anything but top of mind...I've
  certainly sat down and set about making a list of candidates but in a strange way
  can't be bothered with it\u2014I'd rather continue the meat of the design work unbiased
  by a predetermined name, then decide on something when the mood strikes.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for your responses."

    is no evidence of positive effect of typeface name on sale. \r\n\r\nHowever, specific
    name could convey a specific universe that the type design is supposed also to
    suggest.\r\n\r\nAs far as I and my own foundry VTF (www.vtf.fadebiaye.com) we
    are often inspired by music and future, and we try to avoid autoreferential naming
    (i.e. typeface named after a type designer name) because we think that a typeface
    is enough specific and elist as such.\r\n\r\nOr more concrete, you could be inspired
    by the first letters or words you design.\r\n\r\nThere is obsviously no absolute
    rule about all that matter."

  body: "Frank: thanks much for taking the time to respond. You bring up an interesting
    approach to naming in your comment regarding the first letters or words designed
    for the typeface. Thanks also for sharing the link to your foundry's site\u2014very
    great stuff, by the way...I hope to spend more time looking through it at some
    point. I enjoy the music references in the names of some of your typefaces: Tellier,
    Morrissey, Kravitz, etc. Given that designers themselves constitute such a large
    bloc of consumers and more often than not are avid music fans, I definitely see
    how giving a nod to music is an effective naming convention for capturing a potential
    user's attention."
