  body: "It's a bit tricky because they're all distorted (well plus not a lot of letters).
    But it looks like it's limited to system fonts so that makes it easier again.\r\n\r\n<strong>help</strong>:
    Comic Sans.\r\n<strong>me</strong>: something monospaced, I'd say Monaco.\r\n<strong>find</strong>:
    this looks like something in the general direction of Helvetica/Arial but I can't
    find out which one.\r\n<strong>the</strong>: looks like Impact.\r\n<strong>word</strong>:
    first I thought Verdana, but the \"r\" is too wide. Maybe look at Microsoft Sans
    Serif? Not sure."
