  body: Interesting. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got Czech type on the brain right now, as I&#39;m
    reading through the back issues of TYPO and spent last week going through people&#39;s
    reports from ATypI in Prague last year, so I hope you&#39;ll forgive me for observing
    that this seems a little like a more rounded version of Vojtech Preissig&#39;s
    Antikva. It&#39;s more rounded, of course, but the pillowy serifs remind me of
    Ionic capitals &#40;on columns&#41;. I&#39;m not sure they work, but they&#39;re
    certainly different. <BR> <BR>The choice of Kafka for the specimen text is apt,
    because the typeface as a whole reminds me a little of Edward Gorey&#39;s handwriting.
    <BR> <BR>I like the squared-off interior spaces in the C, D, G, O, and Q. The
    U doesn&#39;t work for me, though

    I&#39;m still working on it. This sample has what I hope is the final form of
    the roman style. I&#39;ve added some semi-random ligatures and swash characters
    which are fun, though I&#39;m not certain how useful. I&#39;ve set the first chapter
    of Jerome K. Jerome&#39;s Three Men in a Boat, along with a bunch of other stuff

  body: Whoah! Too tight! Too tight! The character spacing in your example setting
    is kind of insane. <BR> <BR>The face itself feels more balanced now, and strikes
    an interesting balance between the &#34;antiqued&#34; rough fonts like Antique
    Caslon and the Czech fonts I was talking about before. I&#39;m still not sure
    how I feel about those convex serifs, though. <BR> <BR>The italics feel a little
    too straightforward next to the roman. The figures work better now, though. Those
    swash-ligatures are ridiculous. I&#39;m pretty sure in a good way, too. <BR> <BR>Aside
    from that, I don&#39;t have a lot to add. Good choice of setting!

  body: Those characters have character. Your realization of the interrobang is much
    better than the original kind; I can actually imagine it being used and read as
    intended. I like your g very much, and I don&#39;t think the swash g lives up
    to it. <BR> <BR>Your cap D is rather wide, and your smallcap D is <i>far</i> too
    wide.

  body: Forrest, thanks for the &#34;Too tight!&#34; Here is what is going on. Tracking
    is at zero. Kerning is set to Optical. The metrics/kerning in the font is nearly
    identical to the optical setting in InD, though not quite as smooth. The problem
    is that I tweak the metrics and kerning a lot as I work and at high magnification
    on a decent display a 5 unit sidebearing looks ample. Most of the glyphs have
    5 units for the sidebearing or 1/20th of an EM. I haven&#39;t run across a recommended
    width but seeing it on screen at 11pt it is unpleasant. However, printed at 600dpi
    &#40;default for most laser printers&#41; the color is very nice and even, although
    reading it does feel a little off. I have considered adding 1/10th of an em to
    either side. There is a hairspace character in the font set at 55 units. That
    seems too wide a space to have between each glyph, but perhaps 20 units on each
    side would work. I don&#39;t really know. <BR> <BR>It is interesting that you
    specifically mentioned Caslon, an early version of the face was based on several
    different digital interpretations of Caslon and the over all proportions  and
    x-height are still relatively faithful to that model. My initial concern was that
    it would be seen as a Caslon knockoff. However, reading it on paper it retains
    the features I sought to introduce, what you have termed expressionistic started
    out as an exploration of how much tension I could place between the edge of enclosing
    space &#40;the white space around a glyph&#41; and the edges of the space the
    glyph encloses.  I think it works as a text face precisely because the exterior
    of the forms is familiar, thus not challenging to read but the interior establishes
    tension and horizontal movement, the effect at 8pts is, for me, to pull my eye
    across the text. I&#39;m pleased with how this experiment is shaping up. I&#39;d
    originally feared that the experiment would hinder the goal -- that being to create
    a useful book face. <BR> <BR>Kevin, I&#39;m very pleased that you enjoy my interrobang,
    I&#39;ve always had a fondness for the character but found the standard rendering
    to sedate. Thanks also for pointing out the overly wide D and smallcap D. I&#39;m
    also very pleased that my lc &#39;g&#39; works for you as it is one of my favorite
    characters to draw but I find it challenging to strike a balance between expression
    and usefulness. The swash &#39;g&#39; was a discarded character that I did not
    want to let die, and, while it is somewhat out of place, I imagine someone could
    find a use for it. <BR> <BR>Thank you both. I will probably have another revision
    of the roman if I can get some free time and then I need to put some serious effort
    into the italic.

    when you feel there&#39;s nothing to be gained from tweaking the side bearings,
    start in on the kerning. Be careful to avoid overkerning &#40;like your small-cap

    are due to side bearings and which are due to kerns &#40;which is why I suggested
    removing all kerns while working on the sb&#39;s&#41;, but I can offer some educated
    guesses based on your sample: rsb on f is <i>way</i> too large; you&#39;ll want
    to plus-kern special pairs like fb fh fk f&#41;. rsb on j is too small; remember,
    you&#39;re working from the main stroke, not the tip of the serif, so the right
    numeric value may seem alarmingly high. lsb on b is probably too large &#40;ib
    seems to loose, and shouldn&#39;t be&#41;. rsb on u is a shade too large &#40;probably
    d too, but it&#39;s not so bad&#41;. Both lsb and rsb on x are a bit too large.
    <BR> <BR>Side bearings on rounds &#40;obdecopq&#41; probably need to be 5-10 units
    &#40;out of 1000&#41; bigger; your round-round spacings are consistently too tight.
    <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve got some kind of problems with ligs; fe is way too tight but

    After thinking about this some more, I think the best approach would be to create

    the spacing is <i>much</i> improved. It shouldn&#39;t be too hard to figure out

    are several reasons. The first is purely aesthetic, I like the way it looks. The
    second is a more practical consideration, while I understand that the italic form
    has, historically, been more economical while retaining legibility, no one really
    uses italic as an alternative to roman in current practice, instead the italic
    is used for emphasis. A wide italic is just as capable as a narrow one for this
    purpose. Yet another reason is that if you do a tight layout and then need to
    italicize a lot of text, you have to redo much of the layout. If the italic occupies
    the same amount of space the substitution won&#39;t cause any problems. Finally,
    I don&#39;t like reading large blocks of text in normal italics, wider glyphs
    are more readable to my eye.
