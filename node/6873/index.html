  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">&gt;Hello Typophile members and curious people, <BR> <BR>This is my first attempt on a serious Serif Typeface for print and i decided to design the complete characters on paper scketches first. Drawing by hand let me redesing any detail with more natural control, and i supose that is the better way of begin any font. <BR> <BR>The idea is to break the monotony of the curves with a straight internal edges, all trying to keep an organic feeling of many structure constants of the Azteca &amp; Maya geomerical art forms. <BR> <BR>Btw i want to publish the entire process since this firt sketch, so i need your suggestions on the estetic feeling that i want to keep, and the tecnical legibility changes that i have to add with your comments. <BR> <BR>Many of the characters are under construction so i will apreciate a lot if you can help me to decide why some characters works better on tecnical and estetic ways. <BR> <BR>Feel free to add any suggestion, critique or comment, <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>&gt;MH <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/6758.jpg" alt=""></div>

Though I appreciate the uniqueness of the lc x, the top-left and bottom-right ends aren't really picked up anywhere else in the set. I think making those two ends look like the ends of the z would make an elegant solution. <BR> <BR>2. Something about the lc p seems off to me. If you were to use the same approach to the bowl that the lc q uses, but keep the tail serif as it is now, they would be complementary but not mirrors. <BR> <BR>Those are really minor comments, though. The more I look at it, the more I like it. It makes me wish I were European, just so I'd have a reason to use the euro mark. <BR> <BR>I can't wait to see more!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Miguel &ndash; <BR> <BR>A promising start. Very nice letters. The abrupt curves are reminiscent of the explorations of W.A. Dwiggins with his Experimental No. 233 and his theory of the M-formula. Tiffany may chime in with more on this. <BR> <BR>I think this kind of treatment can be effective at very small sizes and at display sizes, but there's a middle range of text sizes where it can be tricky. You may find when your letters go from being outlines to being actual text that you need to move the corner further around the curve to prevent the x-height line from being spotty. <BR> <BR>I think the arch of your 'f' may be difficult to fit. I also think the top of the arch should be thinned a little. And I feel that the top of your 't' should be a little more pronounced. <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Miguel, I don't have the time to present a complete summary of Dwiggins's theory. If Tiffany doesn't jump in at some point, after I meet my current deadlines, perhaps I can provide more information.  <BR> <BR>Just briefly, the 'M' in M formula stands for Marionette. While carving marionettes, Dwiggins discovered that exaggerating smooth, rounded surfaces into sharp, angled planes allowed the figures to more powerfully communicate their character all the way to the back row. He theorized that the same kind of exaggeration and sharp modeling could be made to work in text types to give them additional &quot;action&quot; and &quot;vitality.&quot; <BR> <BR>This kind of exaggeration is well known in theater and underlies the practices of stage makeup. If you've ever seen a stage actor in full makeup up close, you'll realize that it is always hideously overdone, but looks completely natural on stage under the lights. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; natural kerning ligature <BR> <BR>It's certainly a good idea to make your &quot;f&quot; &amp; &quot;i&quot;/&quot;l&quot; glyphs in such a way that they join together nicely without anybody doing anything special, but of course because of possible tracking/justification adjustments you can't count on that entirely. <BR> <BR>BTW, when I was designing Patria I came to the realization that too often the &quot;fi&quot; and especially the &quot;fl&quot; are forced to join up unnaturally, when sometimes they shouldn't. Although I'm actually ambivalent about the current state of Patria's &quot;fi&quot;, I'm happy with my unorthodox solution with the &quot;fl&quot;, and I feel that the conventional approach (like you have up there) can ruin the texture of a setting. Consider ligatures with modified individual letterforms but no joining. <BR> <BR>Another serious issue with ligatures is that tracking can ruin things* - just look at Gulliver's &quot;fi&quot;/&quot;fl&quot; in USA Today. <BR> <BR>* Although I think OpenType allows the choice of ligature substitution based on tracking? <BR> <BR>&gt; hideously overdone <BR> <BR>Yes! And this is exactly why a good -I mean a really good- text face must look ugly in large sizes&hellip; strange but true. You simply cannot have both. <BR> <BR>&gt; anal linebreaking <BR> <BR>We compared dumbness on Typographica, now let's compare anality here&hellip; Question: Do you re-write [parts of] your posts to get a nice right rag? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

There's a very good reason for this: on Typophile you type in a monospaced font, but the viewing is done in a proportional one!

And sorry, I already spend enough time around here! <BR> <BR>Question: do you think it's better if I just chopped the lines up (while I'm typing) at a certain limit?

		<div class="commentbody">The modulation treatment is great, Miguel. <BR>It embraces both calligraphic and geometric approaches, which is a thing many people have done, but you've managed to keep  it very distinct and original. <BR>I don't know if the fi fl examples are your first attempt in drawing text type in bezier, but to preserve the strenght o your original drawings I would suggest to create loose grid background (I mean even single circles or segments where it's appropriate) as a basis to draw the letters. <BR>Many letters have an excellent and unique treatment. The g shines, the Q is great, and the s is very distinct, too. <BR>At this point (after the pencil detailed &quot;sketches&quot; I would not look too much at existing faces for their form. You may look at them for points and handles positioning/relationship, anyway. <BR> <BR>I say all this because the fi fl samples seem to lack the strenght of the pencil version. <BR> <BR>I also share Ricardo Santo's observations on the width of the m, and I would give a more distinct feeling to the tail of the y. Don't ask me how. <BR> <BR>Your alphabet is very promising and could turn out in something extremely beautiful and functional at the same time. Congratulations!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><i>Kent, you can do the talking. Miguel, Kent is the man. He can explain much better than can I</i> <BR> <BR>Miguel, sorry I haven't gotten back to you about the M-formula. What I'll do is quote a message that I wrote to the Typo-L list recently in response to a discussion about Whitman there. The whole thread can be found at <a href="http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0308&amp;L=typo-l" target="_blank"><a href="http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0308&amp;amp;L=typo-l">http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind0308&amp;amp;L=typo-l</a></a> &ndash; thread #47 &quot;Whitman&quot;. <BR> <BR><blockquote><hr size=0>&lt;!-quote-!&gt;<b>quote:</b><p> <BR>There aren't many places to find out more about Dwiggins's M-formula. The only published treatment of the matter that I'm aware of is Gerard Unger's article on WAD's Experimental No. 223 (Hingham), which appeared in the Dutch magazine Quarendo, vol. ix no.4, 1981. Unger discusses the M-formula in the course of tracing Dwiggins's exploration of newspaper type design. <BR> <BR>Tiffany Wardle also touches on the M-formula in her dissertation from 2000, including an appendix with a transcription of the entire letter where WAD spells out his ideas. <BR> <BR>One of these days perhaps I will find the time to treat the matter fully in an online essay on my website. <BR> <BR>For now I can summarize. The M-formula document was a letter written by WAD to C.H. Griffith at Mergenthaler Linotype on July 3, 1937. It consists of four short &quot;memoranda&quot; &ndash; brief observations that all orbit around an idea for treating type letters in a new fashion. <BR> <BR>The first of these is a hunch that advertising printers are interested in a type letter that &quot;will carry a good charge of ink . . . and still look crisp and finished instead of blobby and squz-out.&quot; <BR> <BR>The second is a reference to an article by R. Hopper in Printing Art Quarterly, March 4, 1936, entitled &quot;What Will Be Tomorrow's Types&quot; which predicts a return to classical forms, but with less imitation of hand-lettering and with a new crispness and refinement influenced by precision machines. <BR> <BR>The third memorandum is the famous observation which gives the concept its handle &quot;M-formula&quot; &ndash; M for marionette. This is Dwiggins's observation while cutting marionette faces that in order to really get the head of a young girl to &quot;read&quot; from the back seats, he needed to cut otherwise soft features as sharp planes &ndash; &quot;These sharp-cut planes, when viewed on the stage, by some magic transformed themselves into delicately rounded curves and subtle modellings; and the faces looked like young girls from clear across the room, as well as from the front benches.&quot; <BR> <BR>The final memorandum refers to his stencil ornaments &ndash; which he jokingly called &quot;geometric spinach&quot;  &ndash; and observes how curves and lines go together to create a dynamic grace. I quoted from this passage in my earlier message.  [<i>from the previous message:</i> &quot;I note that straight-line forms and shapes of geometric curves properly put together achieve *more* effect of grace of line and curve and motion than do combinations of free flowing curves and shapes. The &quot;grace&quot; quality is somehow augmented &ndash; stepped up to a higher level by the sharp angular quality of the elements. Also, a new kind of tingle and life is added to the brew.&quot;] <BR> <BR>Dwiggins pulls these all together, saying &quot;I have been cogitating the matters touched upon in Memoranda 3 &amp; 4, with a view to discovering from them a method for modelling type-letters in some other than the traditional way &ndash; to produce in the printed words the quite astonishing results I get with marionette heads and with geometrical spinach.&quot; He also includes some illustrations of his points and some trial letters for Griffith to consider. <BR> <BR>The practical essence of the M-formula was summarized by Dwiggins a year later as &quot;a method to trick the eye (in viewing objects much reduced) into seeing curves that aren't there.&quot; <BR> <BR>Although the image of Dwiggins having some grand epiphany while carving wooden marionettes has some romantic appeal, I think far too much is sometimes made of this &quot;M&quot; aspect of the M-formula. It's a catchy handle, no doubt, but the letter of July 1937 is really a culmination of ideas that Dwiggins had been formulating for at least a year before. In fact, about five months earlier, WAD had written another letter to CHG which laid out most of these exact same points &ndash; referring to the Hopper article and talking about applying aspects of his ornaments (&quot;junctions sharp and square&quot;) to type letters &ndash; without any mention of the whole marionette thing. <BR> <BR>Also, one quibble that I have with Unger's article is that it gives the impression (unintentionally, no doubt) that the M-formula was developed specifically in the context of newspaper type design, which, in my opinion, is not true. It is not until a year later that he applies the idea to a newspaper typeface in development. And even then, it is only one of five possible directions he presented. <BR> <BR>The M-formula document is filed in the Griffith archives with the dossier on the newspaper type Hingham. And Hingham is unquestionably one of the fuller explorations of these ideas. But, in my opinion, the original letter was conceived more closely in connection with the Falcon design where, as I've said, Dwiggins also poured many of these ideas in search of a sharp-finished oldstyle, only to abandon it in the end. <BR> <BR>Again, sorry for the lengthy and slightly academic tome. I hope it has proved at least somewhat interesting to some on the list. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent. <BR>&lt;!-/quote-!&gt;<hr size=0></blockquote></p>

		<div class="commentbody">Well then, allow me to quote myself from Typo-L too! <BR> <BR>&quot; <BR>&gt; I think far too much is sometimes made <BR>&gt; of this &quot;M&quot; aspect of the M-formula. <BR> <BR>Don't you think the recognition of small/distant shapes <BR>has relevant parallels in marionettes and letterforms? <BR> <BR>&gt; one quibble that I have with Unger's article is that it gives the <BR>&gt; impression (unintentionally, no doubt) that the M-formula was <BR>&gt; developed specifically in the context of newspaper type design <BR> <BR>While my quibble with it is that it <BR>makes it sound like the idea is dead. <BR>Why would it be? Anyway, you for one <BR>have shown it isn't! <BR>&quot; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all your comments, specially to Tiffany Wardle and Kent Lew for your time explaining the M formula. <BR> <BR>Is very interesting to know that this is a great chance to contribute, in some way; the behaviour of this kind of ideas on a font for text reading on little sizes..is a big challenge to make one simple and functional font for newpaper readers. <BR> <BR>Now i ve got a more clear idea about the font, with the Upper cases almost solved, as you can see in this another pencil sketch. <BR> <BR>BTW, Quetzal is a beautiful name and bird, i think i will keep the name on this font :^) <BR> <BR>Feel free to add any suggestion, critique or comment,  <BR>  <BR>&gt;MH  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14700.gif" alt="Quetzal Uppercases"></div>
