body: "Is there a type width between Regular and Condensed?\r\n\r\nIf there would
  be such a width, would it be too much of a splitting hairs sort of thing for users
  to understand?\r\n\r\nI've got a typeface in the works whose regular width is just
  too extended for my tastes. But for certain reasons, it has to be labeled the \"regular\"
  width. I have condensed weights too, which aren't really all that condensed, but
  are narrower than the regular.\r\n\r\nShort of renaming my axis points (which isn't
  a possibility here), is there a proper name for a width that would lie between these
  two points?"
