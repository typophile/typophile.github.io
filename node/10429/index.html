<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi, I would greatly appreciate any help with a logo I'll be doing for classes, it's about Gotcha. <br> <br>I read the threads for Al Nadeem, Gotterball, Stamps & Stamps, and the VH1, and saw great comments, also visited the Identity Works site (<a href=http://www.identityworks.com/tools/ target=_blank>http://www.identityworks.com/tools/</a>), and helped me a lot to generate and find names. <br> <br>This is so far what I got <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/70229.png alt="Names to Evaluate"> <br>Voom, Reiken or Roken are the names that came up <br> <br>Do they work? What suggestions do you have? I had the idea of a soldier for the logo, but maybe that's too generic or overused <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif alt=:-( border=0> <br> <br>thanks! <br> <br>P.S.: This is my first post!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gen, welcome to typophile. <br>A few questions. The logo is 'about Gotcha'? What does this mean? <br>Do you mean Gotcha, the surfwear company? <br>And what is your assignment, to come up with a fictitious business name <br>and design a logo? <br>Need more information to be helpful. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi bj harvey, it's about Paintball, the game, haven't noticed that there's a surfwear company. <br> <br>I've seen both names being used, <br>which one is more common? Gotcha or Paintball?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Oh. Wasn't sure what you meant. <br> <br>As far as the marks ... hmmm, well you mentioned the Gutterball <br>thread, in which our friend Jay W. pointed out that a mark ought <br>to be more distinctive than simply typing a company name <br>in a specific font. Sometimes this is difficult b/c of time constraints. <br>But it sounds like you have some time before your classes start, yeah? <br> <br>I would humbly suggest that you select a name from your group <br>and play around with some sketches, just paper and pencil. <br>That is always a good starting point. You might try both uppercase <br>and lowercase, or mixed; you might try different <br>forms of a specific letter; you might try different type classifications. <br> <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>Is it better to choose one and start from there? <br>Or is it better to "play" with two or three and then choose? <br> <br>sorry if sometimes I sound a little harsh or coarse, english is not my native language. <br> <br>thanks.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, it's a shame to give some a word mark or logo that is just <br>a font. <br> <br>It's kind of like Apple's corporate use of straight (non-custom) <br>Myriad. Any third party that wants to look like Apple can now <br>simply use Myriad and they're aligned to their brand.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe it's just a USA thing, but I am much more familiar with "paintball". <br> <br>I was thinking the surf brand, too. (Maybe we're just showing our age...) <br> <br>I would think choosing the name would help a lot in defining your starting point. On the other hand, you might find a font you like, and choose a name based on letterforms that look good... but in a real life project, you would most likely have the constraint of a company name already in place (not to mention lots of other things that the client probably thinks they want...) so I'd pick the name first. <br> <br>One logo idea that comes to mind is "Gotcha" with a paint splat for the "o". But, if the sport itself is known as "Gotcha", that name might be ruled out as too generic. <br> <br>to JP - if Apple uses Myriad unaltered, why do they have it as a custom font, MyriadApple"? I would imagine they have done <i>something</i> to it...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi, you're right, it would definitely help a lot choosing one. <br> <br>In this past days haven't got much time to work in this, did as bj said, lots of sketches, and I thought about using Voom, and came with a logo, but a teammate is more in favour of Reiken. I'll think Reiken will be the name, and start from there. <br> <br>Visited the Gotcha (surfwear) site, duh! I've completely forgotten about that company! <br> <br>The term Gotcha (referring to paintball) seems to be more used out of the States, indistincly, but yes, it's generic. <br> <br>Well, I'll keep you informed about how this goes, thanks!</div>
