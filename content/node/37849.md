  Garamond (or at least that what Illustrator told me it was looking for when I opened
  it) in it. I dont think this is Garamond at all, but am still wondering what it
  is.\r\n\r\nCan anyone identify this one?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: That doesn't look like Garamond. But in your PDF in Acrobat, if you go to
    File -> Document Properties (or I think it was something like that, you'll find
    it), then theres a tab with 'Fonts'. If the font is embedded, it should be listed
    there.

  body: That's the odd thing... it's just listed as Garamond-Book.... the document
    only contains this face and Frutiger... I don't know why Acrobat is identifying
    it as Garamond... really confusing... but I agree, it isn't Garamond, but I cant
    find what it is... it's quite nice... Myfonts.com what the font thingy can't recognise
    it either...

  body: Oh well, maybe it is some kind of odd Garamond then. It does look weird. Maybe
    someone else can give a more definitive answer. :)

    on my system somewhere... but it's not available through suitcase or anywhere

  body: "OK, so after more digging, it turns out this is a substitute font that is
    a hidden part of the PDF system, and is used when the original font is not embedded.
    However...\r\n\r\nIs there a font that is similar to it? It's not too bad, and
    I quite like the forms! (there, I admit it!)"

    this, because Adobe Serif is automatically scaled to fit the widths of the missing
    font.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "It's kind of perverse that this typeface isn't readily available... I quite
    like the uppercase C, and the height of the slabs is quite pleasing... Just goes
    to show how unique fonts are when you look closely enough :)\r\n\r\nBookman is
    the closest I can find too... Mincho is close in some respects but just doesn't
    look right to me. Ah well...\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone else likes the characteristics
    of the substitute font!"

    out of curiosity, how does that work? Will it be just distorted to fit, for example,
    \ a width, or will it be \u2013the vector curves\u2013 \"calculated\" every time
    new and rendered then \u2026"
