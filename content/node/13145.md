  likely, i will be doing it on the website 1st and then print... wanted to design
  something seamless and yet simple-looking. Will be creating an animation for \"Fruddy\"
  in the later stage.\r\n\r\nThe colors are not fixed yet but hoping someone here
  could help me see if the structure of \"U\" or any of alphabets is looking weird
  here. \r\n\r\nWould appreciate if typofiles here could provide me with critqs and
  comments. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "hi-\r\n\r\nyou're idea of seamless and simple arent getting through to me.
    each letter, with the exception of the middle few, seem to be chopped up by little
    white lines or areas that seperate each letter as if it were on top or below the
    other letters. \r\n\r\nthe color also weakens the idea of seamless and simple
    i think. the gradient you have going on is loosely depicting depth or dimension.
    this might not have been your intent but working with the seperation lines from
    letter to letter, this kind of seems to happen. i dont think using a gradient
    is going to reinforce your idea of seamless, i think making this one whole mark
    with no breaks will reinforce that idea better.\r\n\r\nalso, the spacing between
    the R, U and first D is huge and forces the viewer to span that gap. it's a tough
    problem to deal with...maybe try pulling the top part of the leg of the R (can't
    remember what that is called) to the left vertical stroke. that will close that
    space up and  since you stretched the Y to become part of the D, why not pull
    the rounded part of the R into the empty space a little to close it up? not too
    much, but it might be worth a try.\r\n\r\nyou might want to experiment with some
    a little less high and maybe a little longer. i'd say going thicker or going thinner
    would be worth trying too. the strokes seem very bland in weight right now and
    maybe bringing the cap-height down and increasing the width of the mark as a whole
    will emphasize your seamless quality you are trying to convey.\r\n\r\ni do like
    the fluidity of the shape in the Y though, although i think where it joins the
    D needs a little work. keep going though, i think it's a good start, i would just
    start from by losing the gradient and connecting it all together\r\n\r\nw|m"

    and white version that reads then experiment with color. This is especially important
    if you are working in print. Your current logo in a business card size it won't
    read."

    to rework on the entire style of the logo. will post something up realli soon!\r\n\r\nAlumium
    > Fruddy is one of my names for one of my characters for an animation. I think
    i am going to work on the logo from the personality of my characters rather than
    trying to make it look simple and sleek i guess.  :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: Godzi, now you have the right idea. Definately have Fruddy design his own
    look, it will reinforce the illustrations and it will be simplier.

  body: "aloha i m back.. :)\r\n\r\ni did numerous sketches but i tot i just post
    this particular one that i really liked. (pls refer to the 1st post, attachment
    called fruddy_sketch.jpg)\r\n\r\nI wanted the alphabets 'd', 'd', 'y' to form
    a facial xpression of my character. i did one initial graphic drawing frm the
    sketch. (pls refer to the 3rd attachement on the 1st post, called fruddy_1st.jpg)
    i m not too sure abt the eyes in the 'dd's itself, wonder if its too literal?\r\n\r\nI
    m still fine tuning the individual alphabets but kinda of confuse how it shld
    flow. I know this is tricky cos i am using a tablet to draw this. \r\n\r\nPlease
    kindly share your comments here. Appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: godzi, I love the last one with the eyes the y is a smile very cleaver. Very
    appropriate with the illustrations.

      from the y. its fun and witty\r\n\r\nthe way the eyes look to the side makes
      the character appear fun and mischievous. if that is the character of 'fruddy'
      that would work very well."
