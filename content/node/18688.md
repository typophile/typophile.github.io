  to ID this font with.  It is the letter V (attached).  The closest I have found
  is a Zapf Chancery Roman, but it is not quite it as in that font the upper left
  in the Zapf Chancery has two serifs and the upper right does not have the more rounded
  (circle).  \r\n\r\nIf any one has any ideas I am most appreciative.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nWilly\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/V-Font.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks privateortheris.   It was a garden variety TNR italic.\r\n\r\nWhat
    was throwing us off, was that it was used in a logo as a Capital letter and we
    kept looking a capitals in fonts trying to ID it, and never thought about it being
    a lower case that was sized up to match the other capitals.  \r\n\r\nPulling it
    out by itself for others to look at I guess it was quite obvious.  Sometimes you
    just can't see the forest for the trees.  Thanks again."
