  alt="yves bday"> <BR>I very sincere birthday greetings to our dear Yves Peters,  <BR>whose

  is today. His dedication continues,  <BR>with over 2000 posts of expert help and
  friendly good humor.  <BR> <BR>Best wishes, Yves. Thank you for all you&#39;ve done
  for us.  <BR>I hope this new year is a happy one.

    know it, but the type ID traffic is so heavy that  <BR>Yves has taken it on himself
    to scour it daily to make sure  <BR>it&#39;s in tip-top shape. <BR> <BR>I dare
    anybody to develop ID software as smart, as quick  <BR>and as accurate as the
    type ID board under Yves&#39; watch!

    border=0> <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t react any sooner because I limited my time spent
    <BR>on Typophile to managing the Type ID Board, due to the  <BR>fact I&#39;m currently
    SWAMPED WITH WORK you wouldn&#39;t  <BR>believe&#42;. I could kick myself for
    noticing this thread one  <BR>day late. If not for Eduardo&#39;s e-mail &#40;THX!&#41;
    it may have  <BR>taken even longer. <BR>Also THX to Stephen my sensei and partner
    in crime for  <BR>initiating this thread. You guys rock, this is the best posse
    <BR>imaginable to be part of! <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
