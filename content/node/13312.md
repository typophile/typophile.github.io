body: Since type is progressing towards newer technology, how soon do you think it
  will be before Open Type technology is completely embraced by software developers?
  Which Type format do you personally prefer when generating your intial designs?

    devs and by Open Source devs - as it''s really the only accepted way to support
    complex script languages like Arabic. '

  body: 'Well, I know type foundries are embracing Open Type...I''m speaking specifically
    about design and type related software (i.e. Adobe and Microsoft products). I
    know that those companies are behind Open Type technology, I just wonder why they
    don''t seem fully integrated into their software yet. '

  body: I also do all my generating in Mac PS, but I often want to rip my hair out
    when naming multiple fonts within a family to a suitcase. As I've not generated
    any type in Open Type, how is hinting and code different from that of True Type
    and Postscript?

  body: "<em>I think that all of the big foundries have put everything on OpenType
    by now.</em>\r\n\r\nI contacted Font Bureau about a year ago to ask if they offered
    their libarary in OT format. They said that their clientelle hasn't really been
    demanding it, so they don't offer OT fonts. The did say they would develop OT
    fonts if I were interested. I think there are several foundries that have yet
    to offer anything in OpenType."

  body: Now that Apple and Quark are finally getting on the Opentype bandwagon, I
    think that demand will increase dramatically, especially in shops that handle
    a lot of cross-platform work. And I suppose that I need to get on the bandwagon
    as well. I just wish that (a) the technical info offered by Adobe and Microsoft
    weren't written in such a high level of geekspeak; or (b) that someone would write
    a manual/treatise that made the format a little more accessible; or (c) that I
    had the time to attend an in-depth seminar (the one at the aTYPI convention in
    Helsinki looks very promising, but no way am I going to be able to make that one).
    Anyone have any suggestions on option (b)?
