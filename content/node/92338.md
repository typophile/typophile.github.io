  2012 logo. It may be some font that has been outlined/stroked. \r\nThis is the clearest
  image I could find (I included a normal orientation version as well).\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WB2012_4523.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/WhitneyBienniel2012_6736.png]"
