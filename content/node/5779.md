body: This is a pro bono logo &#40;Is that enough O&#39;s, or what?&#41; for a senior
  national league baseball team. I know this isn&#39;t the typical baseball look,
  but I think it captures the Southern California personality and the energy of sports.
  Once I started designing the logotype, I started thinking that this was a job for
  Andrew Baker, but I put my head down and plowed forward. <BR> <BR>I welcome any
  critique ya&#39;ll are willing to offer. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41456.jpg"

  body: overall, great job, scott. <BR> <BR>i definitely think the top right one works
    best witht he regular S. <BR> <BR>It seems like the lines coming of the V should
    be thicker towards the V and get thinner towards the end like they are now. If
    that doesn&#39;t work, maybe just the lines like you have in the lower right would
    work best . . . <BR>  <BR>It also seems like the ball is too straight up in the
    air, i think it would look better if it were at more of an angle tilted right--the
    &#34;ERN&#34; of southern also looks crowded and squished together &#40;moving
    the ball angle could also solve that&#41;

  body: hi scott <BR> <BR>i like this a lot, i agree with sally on the V, i think
    the wavy effect you try to put on the S you should try to include it on the top
    right one on the V.   <BR> <BR>for me southern california is ok, but the vertical
    stem on the E of WAVES seems to need a little work. <BR> <BR>nice one though,
    i am visualizing the uniforms on the senior guys. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>CG

    comments already posted!&#41; <BR> <BR>after looking at your logo a second time,
    these are my revised comments . . . &#40;i apologize for my somewhat fickle opinion
    in this case, but it might turn out to be beneficial &#40;my first comment was
    my  initial reaction; the second comments are after studying the logo a bit more
    . . .&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyway, the bottom right logo is the one i think is best.
    <BR> <BR>Although I didn&#39;t notice it right away &#40;which is why i didn&#39;t
    initially prefer the curvy S&#41;, i like the wave shape the S completes . . .
    it might work better if you have the blue lines meeting directly with the red.
    The lines look akward as part of the V, I did a little fiddling and they look
    even more akward making them transition from thicker to skinny, so i would suggest
    the detached line. <BR> <BR>I still think the ball should have more of a slant
    to the right and that the end of &#34;southern&#34; is scrunched. <BR> <BR>Well
    anyway, i guess that&#39;s my 4 cents. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>In any case, i do love
    the direction of this logo. '

  body: Will the logo always say Southern California with the word Waves. I know most
    baseball team logos typically only use the name of the mascott on there jersey&#39;s,ex
    Giants, Mets, Braves. Maybe it could be nice to do an SC emblem for a hat or something.
    I guess my point right know is that the logo feels a little congested, Especially
    where the ball comes out of the V. There might also be some kerning issues in
    the word Waves. I&#39;m sure your are probably been teeking it like crazy. IMPO
    take a look at MC ESCHER and Victor Vaserely for some fine art inspiration on
    how to maximize the potential of the curves to create the best optical effect.

  body: 'I fail to see why the upper curve of the S should end in a very thin line.
    The same goes for the part of the V, meeting with the S. To me, it&#39;s decoration
    without purpose &#40;and it may cause production/application problems in the future.
    <BR> <BR>The lines coming out of the V shouldn&#39;t touch the ball -- I think
    it would look much nicer, if you could see the ball as a circle. To give you a
    hint about what I mean: if I were to make the correction in Illustrator, I would
    place a circle with white fill under the ball, cropping the red lines. The lines
    should be cropped approx as much as the distance from E to the line growing out
    of the V. <BR> <BR>Otherwise, I think it looks great! <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O'

  body: Cool - I really like it - very sportsy - me and my made up words. I would
    like a mixture of the upper right and the lower right - let me clarify - I like
    the regular S better - I think it needs the weight at the top, but perhaps you
    can finesse the top curve just a hair so that it ontinues the wavy feeling. For
    me I like the line stopping rather than connected to the V because it makes the
    motion of the ball stronger and keeps the word together.

  body: 'fun logo! I especially like the large cresting wave with SOCAL surfing on
    it. And Andrew&#39;s comments are dead on, with one exception: I think you should
    keep the cresting wave, the suggestion sketch looses that and seems more like
    a big flying V. However, the relationship between the letters on the sketch is
    a nice improvement. Before it seemed like the E was getting ready to eat the S.
    Maybe the wave should be more of a curving in wave &#40;ie: Ocean Spray logo -
    see below&#41; than doing a little flip out at the end. Finally, consider not
    making the taper on the underline and the S so severe, it seems too delicate for
    what the logo is for. Looking forward to seeing your revisions. I&#39;ll be waiting

    two. <BR> <BR>It was already mentioned, but the hairline feels too thin, and the
    top of the &#34;S&#34; could use some more substance to aid in &#34;reading the
    wave.&#34; <BR> <BR>I would also like to see the &#34;E&#34; meet the &#34;S&#34;
    in a more friendly way-  to me that transition is a bit harsh. &#40;And you might
    consider softening some details in the other letters as well&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I
    agree with David, that it might feel more like a baseball team logo, without including
    the &#34;SoCal&#34; in all versions - having a simplified version for typical
    use. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve included a logo that I came across a while back. I think
    it&#39;s a Japanese baseball team, but I wish I could remember more. I seem to

    then if people see the big W it&#39;s a plus. Almost like finding the stolen money

    is all curves. and if you wont taper the other letters, why taper the S? All the
    other letters hug the baseline but the S. THe gaps need to be filled between the
    E and S. <BR> <BR>The ES is very open, while WAV is very congested. <BR> <BR>The
    E is way too dominant. V should be more important i think. <BR> <BR>

    each other out. :^&#41; i&#39;d just focus on the word following the larger wave.
    as for the S i would go back to the orginal and use it, or at least draw an S
    that looks like it belongs to the other letters instead of trying to have it doing
    something conceptual.

  body: good morning Scott, <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been thinking about this logo. Perhaps
    you should try a less modified &#39;s&#39; and work on the &#39;es&#39; relationship.
    Attached is a sketch &#40;hope that&#39;s ok&#41; which i think will clarify what
    I&#39;m trying to say. The top one is more of an unmodified &#39;s&#39; with the
    &#39;e&#39; being altered to meet the &#39;s&#39; and fill in some of the awkward
    space &#40;pretty much just reiterating Andrew&#39;s original comments/sketch&#41;.
    Ignore middle sketch. The bottom one is basically the same with a cutting of the
    bottom curve of the s to help continue the flow of the baseline wave. Hopefully
    this will spark an even better idea from you. Just a few final tweeks and you&#39;ll
    have a home run. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42211.jpg"

  body: Maybe its just my monitor, or maybe I&#39;m just daft, but to me it looks
    like there is a little inconsistency in the weight of the letters of SOUTHERN
    CALIFORNIA - I know its somewhat part and parcel with the perspective and wave,
    but it makes a couple of those letters feel a little cramped. <BR> <BR>Like you
    want to deal with that. Have you considered really making the swoosh of the ball
    an actual w by cutting out a piece from the point so that it has two tails? It
    might ruin the effect, but if they taper enough it might still give the feel of
    the swoosh trail of the ball and capitalize on the almost w going there.

    slightly off - I like that it matches the curve, but I think now it has lost some
    of the dynamicsim - like a pop fly that you want to try and catch. Possibly the
    ball could follow the curve through W-A-V but then over shoot it just a bit to
    be both the pop fly and also somewhat surfing on the crest - does THAT make any
    kind of sense? I wouldn&#39;t want to ruin the feel of it, but I think keeping
    the vertical element - at least somewhat - captures excitement.
