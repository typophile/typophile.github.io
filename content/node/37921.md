    Art Deco Era\" went to digital like the examples you show here*. But at that time
    a lot of grafic professionals were able to engrave this style(s) by hand, gosh.
    Maybe it was cheaper than to print it with an existing lead type.\r\n\r\nGreetings\r\n\r\n*better,
    larger photo available?"

    to do with your sample at all. \r\n\r\nArt Gothic is your best bet. There is also
    an <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/urw/art_gothic_normal_ot_std_urw/\">alternate
    version from URW</a>."
