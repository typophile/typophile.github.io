    a model design student and am making the info booth from Shrek and need the font
    to use. \r\n\r\nI had a look at the Faerie font, and downloaded it and the software
    to extract it, but cannot get to it?? (Im not that good with things like this,
    anyone got any ideas or another suggestion for a font?)\r\n\r\nThanks!"
