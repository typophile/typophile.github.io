    exactly sure which version/style this is (Nick's certainly right on it being squooshed)
    but you might try <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/helvetica-87-heavy-condensed/\">Neue
    Helvetica Heavy Condensed</a>."

    offense but that logo is terrible.  Instead of recreating it why not make something
    better?"

    taking Arial Black and narrowing it artifically.'
