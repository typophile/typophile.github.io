    href=\"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/refrigerator.html\">Refrigerator</a>
    \u2013 they might be too \u2018clean\u2019 for you, though."

  body: "<cite>Amateurish or purposely naive?</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, it\u2019s hard to
    guess someone\u2019s intentions, no? Please note that, imo, \u2018amateur\u2019
    has no negative connotations. After all it means \u2018lover\u2019."

    drawn logotype. I've constantly refined it as the company grows, so there is an
    evolution of the design. I'm am still working on finishing the font, it will be
    my third set."

    version? It does look better than on the website. Are you going to release the
    font commercially?"
