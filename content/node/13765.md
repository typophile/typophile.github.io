  Your Usual Bollocks</a></em> (iTunes link requires v4.9 for built-in Podcast action)
  (or <a href=\"http://notyourusualbollocks.squarespace.com/\">NYUB.net</a>). It's
  a very tasty 30 to 45 minute block of various indie tracks with very little jabber
  from the London-based host. He plays some obscure stuff (at least to my ears) -
  some Brit electronica, German electronic. Then he mixes in just enough recognizable
  stuff from Kasabian, Autolux, Aphex Twin and others to keep it at least a tad familiar.
  The unpretentious deejay doesn't even mention his name.\r\n\r\nVery highly recommended!\r\n\r\nPS
  - make sure force yourself past the first 6 or 8 seconds of ironically dished 80s
  pop. \r\n\r\n"
