  body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nFirst impressions - I like it. It's clean, modern and polished.\r\n\r\nBut...\r\nI'm
    unsure about changing a company name - if they've already bought the domains etc.,
    and registered the company under the 'Telindus' name, then it's probably unfeasible
    to alter it. Also, the T-Mobile comparison seems a bit askew - The 'T' almost
    certainly stands for something, but the company is universally known as T-Mobile
    and isn't dropping letters to accommodate a hyphen for stylistic reasons. It's
    very problematic to change names because of the confusion it could cause to new
    & existing customers and possible financial implications for the company. If you're
    in at the inception stage of the company (your post doesn't say if it's a new
    company or a existing company that's rebranding) and nothing's set in stone then
    it might be worth looking at a new name - for what it's worth I like both names,
    persoanlly I'd stick with 'Telindus'.\r\n\r\nAside from this, I'm concerned about
    the light colour you've used - light blues can 'hide' when photocopied, so they'll
    disappear on photocopied sheets.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps - it's looking good!\r\n\r\nSimon"

  body: I think I agree with Simon. My first impression is that it'snice. But I'm
    not sure following T-Mobile is a good move. Also, I think the weight of the words
    may be too light, especially at smaller sizes.

  body: "i agree and agree...you should try making smaller variations of this mark
    at say, 75% and seeing how it translates. i'd guess that face becomes too thin.
    maybe using a more regular weight instead of a lighter weight (if it's available)
    would solve a problem.\r\n\r\ni dont mind the light blue in the mark, but for
    the lettering, i agree with simon, it might be too light in small instances. maybe
    using the black (typical) or if youre set on these colors, you can try using the
    maroon. darkening the blue a bit is an option as well.\r\n\r\nthe actual mark
    is nice too but something feels unstable. something with angles i think. the outer
    angles are close to the the inner angles of the arrows but not the same so it's
    making my eyes kinda move in strange directions. (if that makes any sense) you
    could try color placement changes as well. maybe the red at the top looks better
    than the black, and the black could go to the right.\r\n\r\ni'm just throwing
    out ideas here and playing devil's advocate. it's lookin pretty good in my opinion...i
    just dont like that 't' thing. not my cup of tea and it doesnt seem to make much
    sense. plus the letter looks strange with the lindus letters. something looks
    wrong. i'm not a fan of the dot seperator either. i think a dash would make more
    sense if you stuck with it\r\n\r\nw|m"

    of many sketches I made, this one I finetuned a bit obviously. \r\nThe T Lindus
    indeed is not a good solution, I admit. \r\nThe comments all make very good sense
    guys. Thank you. I'll post the final result in a few days, asking for your opinions
    ok? Cheers\r\n\r\nK."
