<div class=commentbody>Hasn't print been "dead" already for a decade and a half? ;-)
Still, Jobs' take on "people don't read anymore, especially on paper" isn't very different from what most technologists/futurists say at given opportunities.
Even if print and books do die, there is still hope for type. At least for now.</div>

<div class=commentbody>this is absurd.
print will die when physical reality goes away.
electronics, luminous screens, computer interfaces -
these are all great and seductive and increasingly ubiquitous
but to suggest that:
A) they will someday be available to everyone,
and
B) they will someday be preferred by everyone
simply flies in the face of observation and reason.
people are still drawing and painting, too.
not just obscure marginalized eccentrics,
but active and vital artists.

When your battery is on the fritz or your system is down, or when the sun is bright, or when the power is off, or when the cable breaks, or when the UV rays get to you, or when...
You can read a book without worrying if you will need an upgrade, drop it on the floor tuck in a bookmark, lend it to your Aunt Sue, see real type...

<div class=commentbody>From what I can tell, the entire notion that reading is rapidly, dramatically declining, is a fallacy. While sales of what publishers and librarians call “serious fiction“ are clearly falling off, it seems like the markets for pulp fiction, fantasy, nonfiction, comics/graphic novels/manga and periodicals are all selling wildly. The tiny independent bookstores of America have been replaced by massive superstores, whose profits are in free-fall because people buy enough books that they’re ordering them from mail-order discounters to save money—not something that people who only read one or fewer books a year do. Digital library catalogs, editions of books, periodical archives, etc. make it easier to do vast amounts of research in relatively minuscule amounts of time. Stephen King has written about this phenomenon, point out that maybe people are just reading less serious fiction because what’s on the shelves is often boring and pretentious, and consumers would rather just stick to Harry Potter.
Can anyone who works with the book industry shed some light on overall book sales as opposed to the decline in reading novels?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jobs will be dead long before books ever cease to exist. I'm another one of those people (and a design-o-saur at that) who needs and wants to feel the book, smell the ink, and escape from technology into the true reading experience. I've usually got 3-4 books going at once, scattered about the house.

<div class=commentbody>I for one read in bed, on the subway, on the beach, all places I don't want to be staring at a screen. Books are perfect because they are both disposable and reusable, I buy most of my books used (even though I work in publishing).
I think some kinds of books may well be dead - phone books for one. But I have a stack of paperbacks by my bed - and am among the 60% who DO read at least a book a year (more like a book a week, or at least a month). So I think he's full of hot air.
Alarmingly, my eyes are starting to go. It's probably just age but I blame the computer screen as well.
I also read the newspaper!</div>

<div class=commentbody>><em>I for one read in bed, on the subway, on the beach</em>
Although I've not yet taken a laptop to the beach (not so odd, as I actually don't like the beach… unfortunately for me it is just skin cancer waiting to happen…), I very often have my laptop open to read or work in bed or on the subway.
P.S.: Actually, I read and buy quite a lot of books, actually – both used and new. Plus, I read newspapers quite often, although here I must admit as pretty as the print edition is, I always read the New York Times online! It is just more convenient for me, I think.</div>

<div class=commentbody>According to the article [[http://bookyards.blogspot.com/2008/01/decline-of-book-publishing.html|referenced here]], last year there were more books published than the previous year. And I haven't heard of any over decline of book sales, as compared to the decline in printed-on-paper newspapers.
Kindle or its successors may replace paper books, but there's no sign of it yet.
Has anyone seen a Kindle? How readable did you find the screen? *Readable*, not legible--you could read a hundred pages just as comfortably as a well designed and printed book.

<div class=commentbody>Be sure to get out your Kindle everyone! So you can experience the future of reading! It gives you immediate access to any book in the world, typeset by software with absolutely no typographic skill or quality at all! Here's to trashing one of the most refined pieces of human design in the world: the book!
Feh.
Books will <em>never</em> go away, unless something occurs to A) prevent their production, or B) make their production untenable. They're too cheap, to convenient, and too good to disappear. Anyone who says otherwise has too much disposable income (or tech stocks).

<div class=commentbody><cite>I always read the New York Times online! It is just more convenient for me, I think.</cite>
One of the reasons I read the print edition instead is that by paging through the entire thing I often find myself reading articles I would probably skip online, if I just saw the headline. I hate wasting all that paper but I do feel like I am much better informed by looking at every page of the paper.
I look at books as a way to give my eyes a break from the screen, which is why I don't bring my laptop to bed. I wouldn't dare use it on the subway. I also *try* not to stare at the screen in the last hour before going to bed - I was told once it was bad for sleep.
I read an article awhile back that I can't find now in defense of the book - it speaks to this point. Oh well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Uhhhh. 100%-40%=60%. 300 (million people), is to X, as 60 is to. 100..so...180 million people reading more than one book, is a large number to equate to "no one". If there is a hidden meaning here, I think Mr. Jobs isn't hiding it. Because Apple can't make good reading devices either in America or for Americans, preferring to make cheap listening devices and communication toys in other countries, Mr. Jobs is not interested in that 60%, preferring to suck blood out of one entertainment industry sector after another, before someone else does. Good reading fonts, after all, are difficult, when compared to phone calls, or vegging to Black Sabbath for a nickel.
Cheers!

What Stevie didn’t consider is that most Americans may not find the time to read a book in between their two dayjobs and the nightjob (nor can afford a slick MacHotAirBook).

<div class=commentbody>There are several things at play here. First, I’m not one to defend Steve Jobs, but the Engadget article linked at the top of this thread has him saying that people don’t read anymore, not that books are dead. I have issues with both statements anyway.
That people are reading more and more off screens is just a fact, I don’t think it needs to be qualified further. I’m reading my news online on my computers (an iMac and a crusty old TiBook, alas), and I’m reading technical material (documentation, etc.) and work documents. Do I ever need to print stuff? Very seldom, and I think it’s for the better.
I don’t buy the somewhat luddist position of people who want to feel the paper and smell the ink vs. shabby computers or book-reading devices. I love books, I love paper, I love letterpress too, I wouldn’t be here if that wasn’t the case. But I don’t think anyone can argue that John Le Carré or Dan Brown books, which are printed on cheap paper and are the classical read and then throw in a pile of crap kinds of books, are really objects that we want to carry around in this new century. My father consumes them like crazy, then they end up in huge stacks that just take place and gather dust. Never do they get re-read, because that’s not what they’re after: you don’t read novels like these, you consume them as entertainment. If you follow my point, that kind of disposable stuff doesn’t belong to print, in my opinion. These books don’t have the feel of good books, because they are cheap by design.
That market sector, which is just huge, is rife for being passed onto e-book reading devices, screens, etc. I have been working with an Italian company that imports e-ink reading devices like the <a href=http://www.irextechnologies.com/products/iliad>iRex Iliad</a>, and I have had one for more than a year now. That is something, like the Kindle, which you can take with you in bed. It doesn’t make any noise, it doesn’t produce light (you’ll need your regular book lamp), it’s as light and as a book. Don’t take my word for it, try to get your hands on one and see for yourself. And consider a device holds not just one book, you can annotate them without harming the original, you can download one while on the road for a fraction of the cost of the paper version, etc.
Also think of the distribution scenarios and of the environmental issues. Paper needs to be transported by plane, trains, wheel, it has weight, it has limited supplies so new print runs need to be scheduled and produced, then there’s the issue of excess copies, etc. All of this problems that we take for granted are simply not there in a digital scenario. People get books more often, pay them less, authors get paid faster and possibly more without the overhead of print production and distribution, and marketing changes dramatically, too.
For books which are truly of value, either because they’re wonderful references (think <cite>Letters of Credit</cite>!) or just plain wonderful books (the <cite>Divina Commedia</cite> published by <a href=http://www.talloneeditore.it/>Tallone</a>), I just don’t see what the supposed threat might be. Where form is ahead or on par of function, form has value and I’ll gladly continue to pay for it.
As for typography: technical changes are all over the history of our craft, yet until we somehow come up with a way to replace words that need to be read and written, I don’t see any sort of harm whatsoever. In fact I think the market for screen fonts and other ways to present text on screens will become bigger and more diverse, and that is good news for typographers, type designers and for people reading off screens as well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Newspapers are in peril right now, but I suspect that is more from the loss of the once lucrative classified advertising than people not reading. The Web is simply more efficient for buying houses, cars, and getting a job.
And the younger generation probably reads less than the older one (and we ... age 50 ... probably read less than our grandparents).
But when you do read, there is no better format than the old codex.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If the [printed] book were invented today? A novel concept. Let's pretend that printing never existed and books have been printed electronically for the last 500 years and are read on electronic readers that were perfected during the first two or three hundred years of electronic publishing.
[seque to futuristic conference room, start with voice over]
I'm a writer and at my publishers office this morning. The publisher, designers and typesetters have my new book all wrapped up in Portable Document Format ready for global distribution. We're excited. My book is ready to be distributed to the entire world in minutes by just pushing some electrons around.
But one of the designers speaks up and says somewhat confidently, "hold up, I've thought of a better way to get this information to the readers of the world. First we'll chop a few thousand trees and transport them on big trucks to a plant that will grind them up into pulp, wash the pulp with wicked bleach" — he didn't know what happened to the bleach after the wash. "Then we press the pulp and iron it on huge screens, roll this new paper on huge spools, and put the spools on other big trucks to take them a few hundred miles to another plant. It only takes a month or so and only cost a few hundred thousands dollars."
"While the trees are being ground, bleached and pressed, another factory is cooking up big gloppy oil and pigment. The plant cooks this glop to just the right consistently by mixing in some sweet solvents — it's quite a spiritual thing. Then it's put in barrels, loaded on other big trucks, and transported a few hundred miles to the same plant where the paper was delivered."
At this point the designer said "they take our PDF that we have prepped here, and they etch these huge metal plates with the design. Then they put it on these big machines that transfer the pigmented glop, called ink, onto the paper. This pigmented paper is then cut up and glued into stacks called books. These books you can actually hold in your hand and smell, or even lick if you want! These paper books are collected and put into boxes, and then, you know, loaded on big trucks and taken a few hundred miles to a warehouse."
"At that point the books are broken into smaller units and taken on thousands of smaller trucks and airplanes to places all over the world. What about it? What do you think?"
So we think about it. Hmmm? We can deliver this right now with hardly any effort or expense and it can be read on electronic readers that we've been using for hundreds of years, edits and corrections can be made instantly, and autoreaders can even read it to someone without effort. Or we can chop hundreds of trees, mix hundreds of gallons of solvents, cook oil into ink, burn thousands of gallons of fuel and employ thousands of hours of manpower. It didn't take long for us to snort and say "nah, we think not."
[freeze frame, and wrap with voice over]
I'm sure the printed book will last, for a few more years anyway. But you guys are funny. Do all of you naysayers still hitch the horse to the buggy every morning for the ride to the bookstore? I'm amazed at the lack of vision — the same crowd that dismissed typesetting on PCs a couple of decades ago. And let's see, who was that guy who saw the potential for proportional type on PCs?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Blue Streak, you left out the part about paper having a resolution of 2700 dpi vs 96 dpi for screen, and being able read paper for hundreds of pages in comfort, vs two paragraphs on screen.
When we can read screens with the comfort and comprehension of paper, then screens will replace much of the paper sources of information. The silly part of what Jobs says is that people are not reading. The internet is reading too, and book buying hasn't gone down, as I said.
The question is when will screen reading be as good as paper.</div>

One thing I have to do is get up to speed quickly on New York landlord-tenant law, and one of the association members is lending me a 600-page book on the subject.

<div class=commentbody>I'm betting on books. They are fetish objects more and more. As reading on screen becomes increasingly common the line between informational reading and the collecting aspect of owning a printed book will become even more precious. Just follow a thread or two about which vintage version of a book is most desirable. I can see the market for printed books shrinking, and the quality going up as books will become seen more as collectible objects. If on screen reading improves, as we all suspect and are being sold on the idea, then many of us may find ourselves reading books on screen that we own in print so as not to put the wear and tear on the spines.
I like to backpack, but I don't own a GPS device. I take a compass and USGS map. The reason is weight. Same issue with a book. Not everyone wants to be encumbered with electronic devices. There is a freedom to a book and a low tech appeal that probably will never be matched by an electronic device. How many book pages can you read while the person next to you turns on a device and loads the text they want to read? How long to you have to recharge a book before you continue reading? There are so many more factors than on screen text rendering.
<cite>I’m sure the printed book will last, for a few more years anyway. But you guys are funny. Do all of you naysayers still hitch the horse to the buggy every morning for the ride to the bookstore?

The horse and buggy thought is interesting. We do drive cars (for the moment) but horses still exist, along with the tack, training and other associated industries. Horses are still used for patrol and crowd control in some urban environments (I'm laughing as I write from Fort Worth). The new technology came in and the old industry contracted and adapted. Point being that if you wanted a buggy today you would probably be purchasing one from a very skilled artisan. The buggy might very well be of higher quality than what was available pre-automobile.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I wonder if a similar debate happened when clay tablets were starting to get replaced by papyrus.
Clayman: This papyrus stuff sure is sporting, but it'll never replace the tablets! We've had them for thousands of years, there is an inherent quality, the reassuring weight... they can last for centuries and longer! Clay is warm, volumous and sacred, it's taken from our world's bosom, and shaped by crafty hands into a thing of beauty. It is binding and once set, can not be altered. Without clay, there can not be a law.
Scrollman: Yeah dude, but it's frigging heavy, and a pain in the loincloth to produce!
I am sure books will last for at least 10 more years, and would still be around as relics and collectors items after that, but the paradigm is shifting, and as much as this saddens me, there doesn't seem to be much we can do.
Personally, I'd rather we were still hand-drawing things on virginal vellum.

<div class=commentbody>Perhaps the devices themselves can get to the point where it is comfortable to read from, but I have yet to see an electronic book that was typeset properly.
Especially all of the awesome manuscripts available at the Gutenberg Project, which suffer from an especially hard scenario to read or fix:
<ol>
<li>Courier</li>
<li>Forced line breaks</li>
</ol>
Granted, WE could probably just fix the stuff and be done with it. But what about the *millions* of people who have no clue, but gotta have the latest technology?</div>

<div class=commentbody>What needs to happen for the e-books to become the dominant form:
1.The readers must become dirt-cheap (will happened when e-texts become responsible for most of the revenue)
2. The screens must be of high enough resolution and have no strain on the eyes. (Already happening with e-paper)
3. The device must be highly durable and easy to use.
4. Common formats must emerge.
5. Professional practices of design and typesetting must be applied to commercially available texts.
6. Freely available and public domain books and previews (Gutenberg, Moshkov library, google books etc.) be instantly accessible.
7. Free wireless across the western world.
Most of these should be achieved in the next 3-4 years, and 6 more years for gradual adoption and acceptance. So all-in-all 10 years. of course this leaves us with only 5 more years until the singularity, but that's a different story :)

<div class=commentbody>The video phone did not catch on because it does not solve any particular problem. It is more expensive, and less useful then a voice-only phone. It makes people feel uncomfortable and self-conscious, complicating communication. You wouldn't want to receive a call while sitting on a toilet, or on bad-hair-day, and would think twice about calling someone after a night of heavy drinking. Video calling is more difficult, more expensive and less efficient in day-to-day life then voice communication. E-books are cheaper to produce, easier to distribute, and simpler to augment.
Don't get me wrong, I love books, love 'em with all me heart. I enjoy the smell of good binding, the tactile quality of the paper, the sound of rustling pages and the sight of arching spines, lining together on the shelf. The prospect of books becoming obsolete, sends a shiver down my spine. But look at it this way: An illuminated manuscript is much more precious and beautiful thing then a printed codex. Each volume is unique, each infused with the humanity of the scribe and the vibrance of the illuminator. But movable type on paper, is simply more practical, accessible and easier to produce. Clay->Papyrus->Vellum->Paper->... Each was succeeded by the next. What makes paper exempt?

<div class=commentbody>Jobs wasn't suggesting that books themselves are dead; he was commenting on the failure of the Kindle as a product. I disagree with his reasoning--the Kindle is a failure because people prefer physical media, and there's never any reason you would need to carry 800 books with you.

I here propose a minimal list of features that any successful ebook device must eventually have. Feature parity with physical books, after all, is surely a reasonable baseline demand. So here is what the electronic book of the future will be like.
1 It will have an inexhaustible source of energy and never need recharging.
2 It will have resolution as good as print. (No, Amazon: really as good as print.)
3 It will be able to survive coffee and wine spills, days of intense sunlight, dropping in the ocean, light charring, and falling completely into two or more pieces, while still remaining perfectly readable afterwards.
4 It will allow me to scribble notes and/or doodles in the margins, with my choice of mechanical pencil or fine Muji fibre-tip pen (black). (Note: typing in the margins with a crappy thumb keyboard is not an acceptable alternative.)
5 It will allow me to riffle through it and thus get a quick, intuitive look at the book's argumentative or narrative structure.
6 It will allow me to tear off the corner of a page to write down my phone number (or someone else's).
7 It will display to other people in coffee shops and on public transport the title of what I am reading, so as to advertise my erudition or quirky sense of humour.
8 It will be physically handsome, not drop-dead fugly. (Note to Amazon: for pity's sake, next time, head-hunt people from Sony or Apple.)
9 Indeed, the books on it will still be designed, by typesetters and graphic artists, so as to feed our aesthetic pleasure.
10 I will still be able to lend or give books to friends, or swap books in and out of the honour library of much-read novels in a Mediterranean seaside bar.
11 I will be able to use the ebook as a reliable flat surface for rolling cigarettes or other leaf-based refreshments, without worrying about debris shorting the motherboard.
12 When I receive the updated edition of the Oxford Companion to Philosophy, I will be able to press the previous edition into service as a stand for the left-hand music speaker on my desk.
13 The ebook will function, moreover, as both bug-crusher and discretionary hat. Placed on my face, it will make a soft roof against the sun on the beach.
14 I will be able to hurl a fatuous tome such as Jeff Gomez's Print Is Dead across the room without thereby destroying my ability to read any other books.
There. Only 14 features to go before we can all abandon paper. Not too much to ask, is it?</div>

There is something to be said for keeping the process of producing/duplicating something complicated. I mean, if you had to chop down and pulp trees, concoct ink, etch plates, etc. to generate an .mp3 (or an .otf), certain industries might be doing better...
Edit: I should probably mention that I'm aware that type piracy has a long an ignominious history that far predates ctrl+C, ctrl+V.</div>

Seriously? Your 'future' story edits out the process of manufacturing all of the hardware required to produce an e-reader, the digital distribution system required to send out content, and the power needed to run them. In your story, it's as though they just grow out of the ground... like trees.
Books will be around for a lot longer than a few years, if only because they cost so little to buy and there are billions of them in the world already.</div>

<div class=commentbody>eBooks have some obvious advantages compared to paper, and some obvious limitations as well. At least some of those limitations are likely to be eroded or eliminated with time.
It's inevitable that eBooks will reduce print publishing: it's a question of how much and how quickly. I don't expect print to go away in the foreseeable future, but I do expect that the market for print in first-world countries will be reduced considerably within my lifetime.
Personally, I won't be surprised if my own first eBook reader device that isn't a laptop computer is also a cell phone and web browser. Then again, I expect the dividing lines between cell phone, laptop computer and PDA will continue to blur. The iPhone is one of the latest steps in that direction, but it won't be the last.
Cheers,
T</div>

I'm actually a Mountain Dew kinda guy, but I like the humorous jab. Too bad that I just sold my film-based SLR and lenses on eBay. If you like vinyl, I've got around three hundred LPs and a sweet Technics turntable that I'm looking to sell to a sucker. Oops, I meant savvy buyer. I hated CDs when they first came out and swore that I'd never give up my LPs, but I did. I have so many books in stacks on the floor that I practically can't move around my house and studio. (Anyone looking for a set of 1960s Collier encyclopedias? Free if you pick up.)
We are getting deeper into a digital age and like with music and photography, digital books are taking the next inevitable step as the predominant medium. I find the convenience of iTunes to be a thousand times easier than continually changing LPs, putting them back in their sleeve and back on the shelf — in alphabetic order of course. When I think of a song I want, I can be listening to it in a minute or less for one US dollar. That used to be a bit more laborious and expensive to say the least. I rode my bike to the record store more than thirty years ago to purchase my first song. It was a 45 of Stevie Wonder's "Sir Duke" and it cost me $2.50 I think. With my new digital cameras, I love the convenience of seeing my shots instantly and not having to print a dozen to see the one I want to keep. The savings on film will eventually save many times the cost of the new camera.
I think I'm really going to enjoy the convenience and efficiency of the new digital books, just like I enjoy having daily conversations with people around the world about type and stuff without ever having to get out of my jammies. I'm not an early adopter of anything. I wait until a third generation or so before I jump in. I'm watching this with a keen eye because digital books are on step one now and quickly moving to step two. It is inevitable and there is nothing we can do or say here that is going to change it. And it's going to be great.</div>

I expect the opposite; in wealthy nations people will go on reading books because people have the resources to print them, transport them, and are used to reading them. But in poor nations, where there are no bookstores outside the big cities and illiteracy is still common, the convenience of ebooks and lack of a cultural connection to print will make ebooks explode once the price of the readers comes down.</div>

Yes, but your view of that future apparently ignores the fact that the hardware required to produce an e-reader, the digital distribution system required to send out content, and the power needed to run them...is not just a making a book, a reader, or a book reader, is it...
When the argument centers around 'books' it's only half-brained anyway — 'print' being the issue. To take you to another point to view from, I'll tell you that I make a large order to a candle factory two times a year. It took me two orderings before I found a purveyor who would send to me candles simply wrapped in recyclable materials and safely cardboard-boxed, as opposed to a large printed box, in a larger cardboard box, containing individually printed boxes, each enclosing one candle further wrapped in cellophane with little printed stickers on each candle. Who has the time ex-post-web purchase, or environmental disregard, to deal with print and packaging meant for point-of-purchase sales? When you translate this from Candle-world to word-world, you see what I mean, maybe.
But maybe not...;)
Cheers!</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>Books have been around for 500+ years...</em>
Closer to 2000 years.
<em>The end of print isn’t an overnight thing. I’ve already noticed a serious decline in the last twenty years and it’s just getting started.</em>
On what do you base this observation? Obviously not on book publishing, because the number of books being both printed and sold has been rising steadily. A recent issue of the London Review of Books had statistics for the UK publishing industry: the annual turnover is 2.8 billion GBP, which is only .1 billion less than that of sales of <em>bread</em>. 900,000 books are sold in the UK every day, which is one book for every ten loaves of bread. 115,000 new titles are published every year, and excepting an insignificant dip in 2004-05 the number of books published has risen steadily every year since 1947.
Non-print text media have become extremely important in the past fifteen years, but not in competition with books. If you look at the kind of content that benefits from being in a downloadable electronic format one can see how new media compete with newspapers, magazines, reference books (encyclopaedias, dictionaries, etc.) There is, as yet, little competition with most book publishing.
As others have noted, this may change when display technology improves, but I think there is more to it than that. Every dedicated ebook device I have seen has presumed a pocketbook format, which means that it is essentially only useful for things like novels. Go into any bookshop and take a look at the incredible range of size formats and content structuring in books, and you'll see how impoverished the electronic reading devices are; they quite simply cannot replicate the complexity of print publishing.
Comparisons to e.g. vinyl vs CD vs online music or different formats of video recording and playback are misleading, because all these involve media that require a playback device. Going from one medium to another is only a shift in the storage format and playback device. Going from a book to an ebook is a different kind of shift, though, because the book is its own playback device. Reading a book isn't like listening to a recording of someone singing played back on a machine; it is like listening to someone singing who happens to be in the next room. It is worth remembering that typography didn't significantly change the book, it just made it possible to produce more copies more quickly. Reading a book isn't like reading an email, which requires the intermediary machine; it is like reading a letter written on a piece of paper. Despite the technology that has been employed in typesetting and printing the book, its relationship with the reader, and hence the reader's relationship with the author, does not rely on technological mediation.
I live on an island that, for a couple of months each winter, is beset with wind storms. Power outages are quite common, sometimes lasting more than 24 hours. When the backup marine batteries are fully discharged, the computer batteries long since dead, I'm especially glad of my books.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>On what do you base this observation? Obviously not on book publishing...</em>
Based on my own observation of numerous family owned print shops, that had been in operation for decades, going bankrupt. Based on a highly competitive market of paper vendors in my area, each with spec reps, now being down to one vendor and a regional spec rep that is hardly seen. So maybe you're right, books haven't taken the big fall yet. But newsletters, catalogs, encyclopedias, etc. have, and books will soon. At least in my opinion, and I'm not a big believer in the integrity of statistics. Google has started putting books online. Amazon has made a move with a digital reader. Electronic book media is going to improve and the trend is going to accelerate the decline of print. The first big hit to book publishing is going to be textbooks. Kids are toting around books that weigh more than they do, and the books have to be reprinted every five or six years. Soon there will be very good tablet/readers with many features and benefits. Textbooks will be distributed electronically and continually updated.
I'm not a book hater. I got about a dozen for Christmas, ordered another yesterday, and have several more that I'm planning on buying soon. I've really got my eye on the Font Book and pretty certain that it's a collectors item. I'm hunting a copy of the PLINC Alphabet Thesaurus, but it's obviously a collectors item and priced accordingly every I look. However I'm obviously of the opinion that future electronic media is going to be far superior to ink on paper.

A very good point, John. I was talking about books made since Gutenberg's time, on printing presses, but you're right: books existed before Gutenberg, only they were made by hand.
Georg (Bleisetzer) said... <em>I am excited to see what will happen if the System crashs. [...] We all will go back to good old letterpress.</em>
Well, even if the System crashes and there are no more computers or an internet, printing books the way we've been doing damages the environment... So I don't know if going back to letterpress would be such a good idea. (Sorry to get all preachy -- I've been reading <a href=http://www.mcdonough.com/cradle_to_cradle.htm><em>Cradle to Cradle</em></a>, and learning about the dangers of ceratin inks and printing processes.)

<div class=commentbody>I saw Chip Kidd at a book signing for his new novel, The Learners. An audience member asked him about a recent comment he had made about the Kindle. this was the comment he was asked about:
On Monday November 19th, Amazon released something called Kindle, the latest “e-book” reading device. I’ve been asked to comment on what effect I think this will have, if any, on book design as we know it. Here goes.
None.
Sincerely,
Chip Kidd

<div class=commentbody>I really don't understand why ebooks are seen as a danger, as they will bring down the costs of self-publishing considerably, letting the long tail take hold. At that point, the only problem will be reviewing all of them. It should even help designers, who would have more customers (if smaller individual commissions)</div>
