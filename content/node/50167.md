body: "I am looking for a font that is an outline, like made of glass but in 3D block.
  \r\n\r\nI want to create a spectrum of light shooting through the transparent glass
  like font and will create the refracting light etc as it shines through the font.
  I can't seem to find anything that resembles this. \r\n\r\nAny links or suggestions
  much appreciated :)\r\n\r\nThx for looking.\r\n\r\nKC"

    might work for your purposes. I found this by searching for \"3D\". [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gallofonts/isometric-initial-caps/|Isometric
    Initial Caps]] might also work, depending on your vision for this.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: Why not try making your own from a font you have, presuming you have software
    like Illustrator. It might make your final design easier since you could have
    the front and back faces of the letters on different layers.
