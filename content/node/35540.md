  the restaurant will have strong graphic treatments and I didn''t want the composition

  I have included a variation on the logo, the one with the solid black box bordering,
  and then the second logo with lines above and below. The third logo includes the
  by-line of the restaurant, I assume to be put on the restaurant sign. Let me know
  what you think, changes, critques etc. I really would appreciate feedback so as
  to learn as much as possible! '

    logos are the ones that have an idea to them. A concept that reinforces the message
    of the brand. There are plenty of lovely logos that are just a word set in type\u2014and
    some do a fantastic job of setting a mood or personality. For example, I happen
    to like the Veer logo over there on the right of the page. But I believe that
    a logo with a strong, ingenious idea is always the most memorable. I don't mean
    an idea which overcomplicates the logo\u2014simplicity is key. I mean an idea
    which provides the viewer with both a visual discovery and a mnemonic device.
    There is something wonderfully satisfying about seeing a logo which makes you
    go, \"wow, that is really clever/smart/unexpected.\"\r\n\r\nTo me, as simple and
    strong as your logos are, they are merely a typeset word, and heck, a lot of people
    can do that. I know, there's a lot of logos that are mere words out there. I think
    that's because creating a logo with a real idea is so bloody hard.\r\n\r\nJust
    a thought. ;-)"

    'animalia' is some sort of exotic steak house or rib joint.\r\n\r\nIt'd be like
    calling a steak house 'broccoli and such'.\r\n\r\nBut, as far as a logo, this
    certainly feels 'upscale restaurant' to me. I agree that a clever mark to go with
    it would be fun...and might be critical if the name sticks to reinforce the NON-meat
    aspect of the place. \r\n\r\nNot to derail the discussion, but this is one of

    motif to go with the type---something to engage the imagination and get the point
    across. If it's a vegetarian restaurant maybe a ghostbusters-style circle with
    cross thru it and a cow inside the circle, or something like that.\r\n\r\nConsider
    using a softer-edged font. Vegetarianism is tantamount to humanism (human respect
    for animals), so how about using a Venetian (Benbo, High Tower, Jenson etc) and
    lower case letters, or even a script type.\r\n\r\nColor would help make it more
    attractive too.\r\n\r\nThe by-line needs a hyphen: \"A meat<strong>-</strong>free

    in a box, however, there is either too little or too much space at the bottom,
    by which I mean that the baseline to bottom of the box seems not to be equal to
    the ascender to the top, if that is intended then I think you need slightly more
    space at the bottom, if it isn\u2019t I think you need to reduce the height of
    the box. As for the name I would be annoyed by the name and the patronising strapline

    appreciated. Malbright I agree that yes, it's just a typeface etc but as I said,
    I did want it to be simple, but I will try to add a graphic element as I think
    this could really develop it, and I definately agree that it's awesome seeing
    something that is clever. And thanks James re the grammer, (the use of 'meat-free')
    I didn't realise... I'll also try the box width and spacing etc. The whole idea
    of ANIMALIA is to be ironic, and I like the idea of ANIMALIA with the box around
    alluding to an animal being branded, or meat. I think Timd really got what I was
    saying. But thanks again, and I'll try to post some new developments, and once
    again more feedback would be saweet.

    seems to me like you might be mocking vegetarians if what you're trying to do

    like branding of animals that make people become vegetarians in the first place?\r\n\r\nThere

    made a brand element (a real cattle brand) to go along with ANIMALIA logo (such
    as an A with a bar above and below) and then apply that to silhouettes of things
    like broccoli and carrots? Push the irony a bit further. I think the trick is
    to make it ironic enough that people get it while still retaining a sense of elegance.\r\n\r\n\"Isn\u2019t

  body: "Sorry folks, I was in a hurry when posting and failed to explain my point
    properly. What I'm driving at is this: I honestly think a plain sans serif is
    too sterile and a far from ideal type for a restaurant, as it lacks organic qualities.
    If the brief feels instinctively off-target and the specs appear set to produce
    an ineffective design I have no qualms about bucking the specs.\r\n\r\nYou shouldn't
    either. If it doesn't make sense, try something that does.\r\n\r\nUsing a Venetian
    type for this logo is an exaggerated alternative. Here are some mock-ups using
    types closer to the original brief:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/animalcomp1_6218.gif]\r\n\r\nSerifa
    black, plus Serifa regular for the by-line. Graphic effect without the sterility
    of a sans serif.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/animalcomp4_4313.gif]\r\n\r\nSerifa
    bold caps. Effect as above but the capitals make it less endearing. Some patrons
    might think they're being shouted at.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/animalcomp3_5267.gif]\r\n\r\nClarendon
    black plus Clarendon regular for the by-line. The bracketed serifs and tails on
    the a's make it much more organic. But it's still graphic in effect. Dectractor---Clarendon
    is widely used and may not stand out enough for some patrons.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/animalcomp6_4300.gif]\r\n\r\nChianti
    black plus Chianti bold for the by-line. Closer to a sans serif without being
    one. Not as graphic in effect but friendly and organic at a glance. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/animalcomp5_6232.gif]\r\n\r\nChianti
    weights as above but all capitals. A more graphic effect from the same type. If

  body: "Love that idea Lex!\r\n\r\nAnimalia set in type that simulates stark meat
    packaging or cattle branding doesn't strike me as particularly ironic. I suppose
    if the word were VEGETABLE and it looked like meat branding, that would have some
    inherent irony. But since the name is ANIMALIA and the type looks like something
    on a package of MEAT, there's no inherent conflict that would present itself ironically.
    Actually, they kind of look like they belong together.\r\n\r\nBranding vegetables,
    creating an animal out of vegetables or broccoli ... those are ideas that are
    interesting because of the juxtaposition. They also truly underscore the concept
    of the restaurant. And by the way, they're pretty ingenious too. It's that kind
    of intrinsic counterpoint that could make this a logo people will remember and
    enjoy. I believe such a mark would do a better job of selling the restaurant and
    bringing people in. I believe that on a subconscious level an intelligent, ingenious
    design causes people to raise their expectations about the whole experience, and
    it gives them a helpful mnemonic by which they can hang on to the memory in their
    busy brains.\r\n\r\nThere's something very pleasing about discovering a visual
    irony ... or a vegetable irony, as the case may be. I could just hear one of my
    vegan friends saying, \"Lets go to that restaurant with the broccolli animal thing.
    That was cool.\" I cannot imagine someone saying, \"Let's go to that restaurant
    with the really stark type that says Animalia. Just looking at that logo makes
    me smile and feel happy. It's very wecoming\"\r\n\r\nI also agree with James that
    there might be a better approach than something so sterile. In just a few minutes
    he put together some rather nice treatments that have personality and warmth.
    Very thoughtful and kind of you, good man. If you're not going to have a pleasing
    ironic interplay, at least make the customers feel warm, welcomed and enticed
    when they see the mark.\r\n\r\nIf you want to stick with the stark, cold MEAT-like
    labeling motif, in my view you're going to have to add something to it to make
    it ironic. Otherwise I think it just looks cold, flat and not particularly relevant.
    \r\n\r\nAnyway, It's really fun to read everybody's opinions and see their examples.
    That's why I love this place. You learn. You meet really smart people who provoke
    thinking. And you get to bathe in gorgeous fontrocities. A delightful way to spend
    an evening indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    clear message. Are you saying hipsters are now vegetarians, or it's hip to be
    a veg, or it's only a place for vegetarians who are hipsters, or you want to create
    a cool veg eatery that has some style to it?\r\n\r\nAs a vegetarian, if someone
    told me it was a 'hipster vegetarian restaurant' I'd probably be immediately turned
    off. In my impression hip no longer is what's new and cool, but a bunch of annoying
    young people wearing bad neon clothing, and ridiculous fashion that would otherwise
    usually be left on the runways of fashion shows.\r\n\r\nSo, that being said, I
    don't believe that mark is the right fit. Personally, I find it plain and if I
    was looking for my restaurant to stand out from the crowd I'd probably a more
    daring feel as opposed to conservative.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIn response to aluminum's
    statement about why people don't eat meat \u2013 I personally don't for health
    reasons, and my wife doesn't for environmental reasons. Neither of us are non-meat
    eaters because we think it's about animal rights or a statement against cruelty
    to animals. \r\n\r\nJust an observation that the name might not always connect
    with your target audience either. It's also slightly hard to pronounce IMHO."
