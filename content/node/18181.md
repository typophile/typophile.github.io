  body: "I actually think it's sufficiently distant from Frutiger,\r\ncertainly more
    distant than some other fonts out there.\r\nFor one thing, it has a nice warmth,
    due probably to the\r\nsoft finish, but also the variances in the terminals, etc.\r\n\r\nIn
    fact the main \"problem\" that jumps out -the pervasive\r\nwobbly outlines*- might
    actually be something to keep in\r\nthe end! It might add just the fauve feeling
    that a sans\r\nlike this needs so badly to be: attractive; and different.\r\n\r\n*
    Like see the right side of the counter of the \"b\".\r\nBut really almost everywhere.
    \ :-/\r\n\r\nA macro thing: I would make the descenders a bit shorter.\r\n\r\nAnd
    lc micro stuff:\r\n- \"c\": a bit too narrow.\r\n- The eye of the \"e\" is a hair
    too big.\r\n- The \"f\" and \"t\" are imbalanced - but again here this might be
    a good thing!\r\n- \"k\": maybe a bit too conservative.\r\n- \"r\": beak terminal
    a bit too out-of-character; try it like in the \"s\".\r\n- \"v\": too wide.\r\n-
    \"z\": too sharp.\r\n\r\nI might look at the UC and nums later.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI
    think you should think about what this needs to be, and I\r\nhave a feeling you'll
    actually uncover something very useful.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Maybe one thing you could do is print your letters quite big and observe them
    upside down from the distance.

    problems.. '

  body: "The caps are actually pretty original (if in a -necessarily- subtle way).
    Like your intuitive-but-unorthodox stroke weight distribution in the \"M\" is
    actually very refreshing, to me at least.\r\n\r\nA: too wide.\r\nK: make lower
    arm darker than upper, not the other way around.\r\nL: slightly too narrow.\r\nR:
    join of bottom of bowl and leg unpleasant.\r\nS: too top-heavy.\r\nT: slightly
    too narrow.\r\nU: bottom malformed.\r\nZ: maybe too sharp.\r\n\r\nNums:\r\n2:
    spine too thick and maybe too stiff.\r\n3: a charmer!\r\n4: too dark.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The shape of the B is broken. The top bowl is unshaped.\r\n\r\nThe lower
    half of the x is the same size as its upper half, what makes it look smaller,
    hence unstable. You should make the lower half bigger, and also make sure it\u2019s
    at least as wide as the upper half.\r\n\r\nI think the form of the a doesn't match
    to the other characters. I think it is a bit too round at the belly.\r\n\r\nThe
    e is too sharp at the right side. Nowhere else you got these sharp edges.\r\n\r\nU
    is too wide. You have to make it narrower than the H\r\n\r\n\r\nHere aresome advices
