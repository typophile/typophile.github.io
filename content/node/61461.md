  trying to adapt this for a technical illustration. There are several fonts that
  are reasonably plausible matches for the ANNUIT COEPTIS font, namely the free United
  States font and the commercial LHF Bank Note and LTR Federal. But I'm stuck on the
  NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM part!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NOS_4912.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
  frustrating because it really doesn't look that extreme, yet I'm having a hard time
  even getting into the ballpark. The closest match I've found so far is URW++ Stencil
  Solid, but that has stick-outy serifs, and the contrast between thick and thin strokes
  is too great. There's also a vague suggestion of ITC Bookman, but Bookman is more
  stylized.\r\n\r\nI'm sure the actual engraving isn't based on a standard font, but
  I'd like to at least get closer. Any help would be appreciated."
