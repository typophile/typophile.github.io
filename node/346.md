  body: That&#39;s because we don&#39;t do it for the money, but out of sheer  <BR><i>PASSION!</i>
    &#40;And also because we don&#39;t have social lives =D &#41; <BR> <BR>Miles rewles!
    <BR> <BR>Stewf, I really hate it when both the ID request <i>and</i> your  <BR>positive
    ID come in simultaneously with the e-mail  <BR>notification. I didn&#39;t even
    get the chance to cross-post... ;&#41; <BR>You&#39;re just too damn fast, pardner!

  body: The sales people at FontShop are probably trained to pretend <BR>Emigre doesn&#39;t
    exist. <BR> <BR>Link me, Yves.
