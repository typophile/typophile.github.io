    quite a bit tired - personally - to see so much stuff (and now a film) made on
    the most generic typeface of all times. I understand of course it's importance
    in the context of the modernist movement and that it's a well crafted piece of
    design. \r\n\r\nShouldn't we be over this font, especially when we can all agree
    of it's very limited use in contemporary typography? (no italics, small caps,
    old style figures, ... and not very good for signage and very poor for reading
    enjoyment, ...)?\r\n\r\nDo we, subconsciously, long for the \u201Cgeneric/inexpressive\u201C
    in design?"

    it has been so overexposed it's as if it's considered entirely featureless, which

    all film material? Do they have the recognition and broad exposure to make film
    the medium of choice or is a book or magazine or Journal article the best place
    to portray type?\r\n\r\nWe type lovers would all rush out to see any film about
    type (since there have been SO many) but the cost and time to make a film means
    you have to find a broader audience.  You can argue the case for a few other typefaces
    as well but Helvetica is certainly on the list for either the love or hate kinds
    of interest which would entice film viewing.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    talking head vs. talking head. Because from what I've seen of the doc so far,
    it's unlikely to be as unequivocal as, say, An Inconvenient Truth.\r\n\r\nAs Erik

    was more like Neue Haas Grotesk's art director. This doesn't negate that Miedinger
    was more art director than designer, too. But designers keep tending to want to
    give Miedinger the design credit for Neue Haas Grotesk/Helvetica, and this isn't
    exactly accurate."

    this before on other forums. Why do you believe it anyway?\r\n\r\nWilliam, Hoffmann
    was Miedinger's boss, and he commissioned the work. Miedinger drew the key characters
    of one or two weights for Hoffmann's approval. These typefaces were then produced
    by Haas. I don't know who in their design offices worked on completing the sketches.
    After a few years, Stempel and Linotype in Frankfurt took over the typeface, developing
    it into the super family that we now know as Helvetica."

    any record, sample drawings, etc) that he spent 20 years working a the design
    of Neue Haas Grotesk makes the story more complicated than it probably was. It
    also implies that Miedinger was already working on the design before Hoffmann
    commissioned it, which I doubt is the case. If this were true, then Hoffmann and
    the Haas production team might deserve less credit, where in my opinion they actually
    deserve more credit than they have gotten!
