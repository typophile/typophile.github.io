  I have a new weekly column  <BR>on Typographer.org in which I critique recent typeface
  releases. <BR> <BR>If you are releasing a new typeface/type family or know about
  any <BR>interesting new releases, I would be very grateful if you&#39;d notify me.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Tho the weekly schedule of the column is pretty
    demanding, <BR>I&#39;m having loads of fun, and it&#39;s the perfect opportunity
    to  <BR>practise my English writing. Plus the fact that it&#39;s a column  <BR>allows
    me to be very personal and really speak my mind,  <BR>something my role as moderator
    here doesn&#39;t always permit. <BR> <BR>The only thing I miss is direct feedback
    like we have here  <BR>or for my Typographica pieces. So if anyone ever feels
    like  <BR>commenting, don&#39;t hesitate to <a href="mailto:bald.condensed@typographer.org">
    e-mail me</a>. Even if it is to say: <BR><i>&#34;Thank you for slagging off my
    typeface, you bastard! NOT!&#34;</i> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
