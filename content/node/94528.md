  body: "It's called \"new alphabet\", not \"new font\". Seeing a rendering of it
    as \"too bold\" misses the point. Crouwel, along with Thompson, Cassandre, yours
    truly and a few others have intended to design a variation/improvement of the
    Latin alphabet itself, not merely a font. In fact even on that very cover above
    you can see two renderings of his New Alphabet.\r\n\r\nAn idea can be patented,
    but I don't think Crouwel did any such thing; and in my book any alphabet designer
    must necessarily give up any IP protection, otherwise the idea can never catch
    on. So to me there are no ethical or legal repercussions possible here.\r\n\r\nLastly,
    although I'm not a big fan of the New Alphabet, I wouldn't call it useless simply
    because it's not sufficiently readable. It's legible enough to be usable, under
    the right circumstances. Even NotCaslon is.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I haven\u2019t added any more either. \r\n\r\nIn theory, Crouwel\u2019s alphabet
    could be rendered as a Didone, Oldstyle, whatever.\r\n\r\nRounded terminals (rather
    than chamfering) and a conventional-alphabet \u201Cstylistic alternate\u201D (or
    vice versa) would make it more amenable to practical usage by non-robot readers.\r\n\r\nBTW,

  body: "<blockquote>nobody else has developed a typeface using the same alphabet</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI've
    learned from my own experience that it's very hard to spread something like that,
    but without explicit promotion it's pretty much impossible. When people see an
    actual font it's very hard for them to see the new alphabet behind it. To this
    day I get emails asking for the so-called Mas Lucida font I made to demonstrate
    my alphabet reform ideas from 1998, and I have to again explain what the point
    really was... An alphabet, being an idea, needs to be seen and promoted as a non-tangible
    thing.\r\n\r\nUnicase: I certainly agree it's an interesting area, but I still
    think it's a bad idea to start students off with it; if time is limited (and from
    Art Center At Night course I learned that it always is) I think it's better to
    just stick to lowercase.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    educationally useful (offering perspective on the bicamerality of the Western
    alphabets), it encouraged speculation and experimenting that was a little too
    expressive and open-ended. I suppose I could have limited students to a particular
    \uFB02avor of unicase alphabet, probably the Alphabet 26 variant, but that would
    have been restrictive. Alternatively, the constraint could have been to a certain
    genre of typeface, e.g. oldstyle or geometric sans, while keeping the unicase
    alphabet options open.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I moved on to different non-unicase
    strategies at another design school, and haven\u2019t taught for 18 months."

    corresponding to my post above being relatively complicated).\r\n\r\n"

    say you have different \"avatars\" (renderings) of Crouwel's New Alphabet. Note
    BTW that a writing system can be defined to a varying extent; the Latin alphabet
    is very loose and nebulous, and invented alphabets based on it as a rule make
    things more formalized. For example in my alphabet reform work I've stipulated
    that the lc \"el\" leans rightward. Crouwel's has its own formalizations that
    can be intentionally adhered to or deviated from. All the fonts in that book are
    essentially strict incarnations of his idea, not merely Latin fonts.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Does
    the blobbed version belong to the same \"font family\"? I don't think so.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhy
    not? It's just a rendering where the pixels are overlapping circles. BTW as far
    as I can tell that's supposed to simulate what happens on an imagesetter (in \"write-black\"
    mode).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I agree that the right blobby would be the same though, from a "programmatical"
    point of view (is that not part of the title) there is a difference between the
    font with the "chamfered corners" and the two others (dotted and blobbed). The
    dotted and blobbed are clearly made out of planar pieces. The one with straight
    edges is more simply described by its contours on a grid of points with integer
    coordinates. You can easily directly write an eps file to display each of those
    characters with "newpath", "moveto", "lineto" and "closepath" commands.

  body: "A brief point of terminology: <em>uncial</em> (note order of letters) refers
    to a style of lettering that existed before upper and lower case came into being,
    and <em>unicase</em> refers to modern efforts to blend them back together again.\r\n\r\nMuch
    of the practical value in a unicase is the lack of ascenders and descenders. The
    list of normally-formed Latin lowercase letters that have a significantly different
    shape from the uppercase and remain within the x-height are: a, e, m, n, r. That's
    a short list to work with. But you are right to observe that 'a' and 'e' are given
    preference. They are among the very most frequent in English and most other Latin
    languages, and they are vowels. It is reasonable to conjecture that vowels have
    more impact on the \"voice\" of a typeface in the mind of the reader."
