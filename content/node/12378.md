    of them aren't compatible with Safari 1.3.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you might want to
    ask on the Apple boards."

    also doesn't work... it starts and background of installer shows but no information
    words on buttons or anything so it hangs too.\r\n\r\nApple toy life... poo"

    with the new Tiger OS. Has anyone else installed Tiger and had problems launching

      my machine ran slow for the first couple of days but now its much quicker with
      hardly any slow down at all, even when I have indesign, Photoshop and illustrator
      open at the same time, where as it used to be quite slow. '

  body: "I upgraded without a hitch. Everything's faster, and all my design apps run
    fine. \r\n\r\nSpotlight has already come in handy several times too. Just make
    sure you let it finish its initial indexing before you do any serious work.\r\n\r\nQuartz
    Composer (which comes with the developers' tools) is very cool. You can design
    and play back complex animations and effects that render right on the graphics
    processor.\r\n\r\nI haven't heard of any bungled Tiger upgrades, Vince. If you're
    having trouble, talk to Apple. They didn't get ranked #1 in computer customer
    service by hanging customers out to dry."

  body: "Vince, have you rebooted your Mac since the initial installation of the update?\r\n\r\nSometimes
    a second reboot will force all of the automatic system-level maintenance scripts
    to run and do a bunch of stuff that needs to happen on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nIt
    really sounds like you need to run a system utility like <a href=\"http://macosxcocktail.com/\">Cocktail</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/11582\">OnyX</a> to clean your
    application and system cache files and repair permissions. Something has caused
    some file access problems with a few of your applications. You shouldn't need
    to reinstall anything. If you are unable to download and install a new program
    like Cocktail, then boot your Mac off the original OS X CD that came with it and
    run the Disk Utility from the CD. It will allow you to repair permissions at least."

    other day for an hour. It's a G4 12\" Powerbook... toy."

    bunch of buggy quirks now. I had some problems with Illustrator and Photoshop
    CS not copying and pasting between each other (it dropped some weird error), but
    after some restarts and poking it just went away.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I'm
    happy with it. Now I just need more RAM."

    behavior and scroll bar freakouts.\r\n\r\nRelated: An update, 10.4.1, was just
    released today. Hit your 'Software Update...' option in the Apple menu. Apparently,
    many of the fixes are related to \"3rd party mice with scroll wheels\", according
    to a friend of mine."

    There's a special area for sorting out problems with Tiger:\r\n\r\nhttp://discussions.info.apple.com/webx?14@290.PhjBavYaWdQ.0@tiger\r\n\r\nYou
    might have better luck there than on Typophile.\r\n\r\nNuking the hard drive seems
    like a rather drastic step (although I have the impression that it is a routine
    solution in the Windows world)."
