  Staff of Kat Ran Press is pleased to announce the publication of the first in a
  series of books about postage stamps by type designers, Lance Hidy's <em>Designing
  the Mentoring Stamp: An artist's commentary on theory, gesture, photography, composition,
  color, light, and the typeface Penumbra.</em>\r\n\r\nLance Hidy, the accomplished
  designer of books, posters, types, and stamps, takes us through the process of designing
  a postage stamp while explaining how the small Mentoring stamp relates to his larger
  body of work. Thirty-eight full-color reproductions illustrate the photographs,
  designs, drawings, and photographs which were part of the design process, as well
  as related posters and illustrations from the last thirty years of Hidy's work.\r\n\r\nFor
