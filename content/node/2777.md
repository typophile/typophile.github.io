  body: The California Soul, imo, is a straight scan from a <BR>vintage California
    tourist-type tee or postcard. <BR> <BR>It features a mix of italic and script
    forms. <BR> <BR>The &#39;Soul&#39; looks tacked on House Industries, I think <BR>from
    the Vegas set... <BR> <BR>Similar fonts can be found by checking out myfonts.com
    <BR>and typing keyword 70s. <BR> <BR>Just three off the top, Lazybones, Candice,
    and Octopuss.

  body: 'Tom,  <BR>The way California wraps around itself with the swash letters strongly
    says &#34;art work&#34; not font. In addition to Ignacio&#39;s suggestions Letterhead
    fonts has two fonts that come with a variety of underlining swashes: <BR><a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/styles/script.shtml"
