  a positive one.\r\n\r\nI have been contacted by a major NYC studio that is looking
  for a senior graphic designer with good lettering skills.\r\n\r\nPlease do not post
  here, but send the link to your portfolio to me via my contact info in my profile.\r\n\r\nSee
  you all in the future some day.\r\n\r\nJames"
