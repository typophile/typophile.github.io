body: 'I&#39;m editing my college&#39;s small student newspaper this coming school
  year, and learned enough from Bringhurst&#39;s _The Elements of Typographical Style_,
  which I just finished, to realize that we badly need a redesign. Right now I&#39;m
  being daunted by the task of choosing fonts... any input would be appreciated. <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;m leaning towards keeping two elements from last year: setting the flag
  &#40;the paper&#39;s name on the top of the front page&#41; in Modern No. 20 and
  using Futura for the paper&#39;s sans-serif. For the text, which will be 9 or maybe
  10 pt, I&#39;m toying with Mrs Eaves or &#40;a little angel on my right shoulder
  says this is a bad idea&#41; Bodoni.  <BR> <BR>I also thought about just using Bodoni
  for the headlines. But every damn newspaper I look at seems to be doing just that,
  or using something close. I also thought Futura Bold looks interesting as a headline
  font, but it feels like that would be overusing it if we&#39;re already going to
  be using it a lot elsewhere.'

  body: I&#39;m not one to piss on anyone&#39;s parade Zach, but I&#39;d caution you
    against using either Mrs. Eaves or Bodoni as a copy face. As much as it&#39;s
    overused, I&#39;m afraid my poor eyes would rather see Times again than either
    of of those at 9 points. There&#39;s a thread here about Eaves somewhere &#40;I&#39;ll
    see if I can find the URL&#41; that you might be interested in. [<a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/13202.html?1059028644"
    target="_blank"> here&#39;s the link</a>] <BR> <BR>And now that I&#39;ve pissed
    on your parade, I don&#39;t have any suggestions right off. I&#39;m assuming &#40;from
    past small press work&#41; that your budget is small if not non-existent. What
    other faces do you have at hand?

    Bodoni. <BR> <BR>If your little angel warned you about Bodoni but said nothing
    about the dangers of Mrs Eaves for small point sizes, fire him pronto - no severance
    pay. News fonts are all about x-height, and Mrs Eaves&#39;s in tiny. <BR> <BR>As
    for Bodoni, there&#39;s such a wide range of them in terms of appropriate point
    size usage that some choices would produce passable results while others would
    produce readability quicksand. I say &#34;passable&#34; because even the best
    Bodoni would not be a good choice: its letterforms are structurally display-centric,
    not text-centric. <BR> <BR>There are many rock solid news faces you can choose
    from. Like the calm, versatile Olympian, or the edgy, highly efficient Swift,
    or the multi-talented &#40;but pricey&#41; Poynter. There are so many, and I&#39;m
    not really an expert. If you need some good places to start, look at FontBureau&#42;
    and Unger&#42;&#42;. And beware small foundries who have one or two fonts they
    claim are fit for news setting; they pretend -or even believe- they know what
    it takes to make a real news face, but it&#39;s really a dark art. <BR> <BR>&#42;

  body: Agreeing with Nathan... <BR> <BR>some common newspaper typefaces include...
    <BR> <BR>Cheltenham, Miller, Olympian, Ionic, Corona, Century, Nimrod... <BR>
    <BR>there are probably a dozen more. <BR> <BR>Make sure you read Tim Harrower&#39;s
    book and <BR>visit <a href="http://www.ronreason.com" target="_blank">www.ronreason.com</a>
    &#43; lots of <BR>other resources online for newspaper designers. <BR> <BR>For
    headlines, Futura might not be versatile enough. <BR> <BR>Jim Parkinson&#39;s
    Richmond, Hoefler&#39;s Knockout are <BR>2 versatile families. Maybe even Gotham.
    <BR> <BR>You could probably do one-stop shopping at Font Bureau. <BR> <BR>Of course
    the text face should go with the display face. <BR>I&#39;m sure the FB staff could
    give you some great suggestions. <BR> <BR> <BR>For the Flag, I would look into
    doing something custom. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure someone has some better specific
    suggestions. <BR>I&#39;ve been out of newspapers for a while now. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: '&#62;Nothing wrong with using Futura in different places for different elements
    &#40;it comes in different weights right?&#41; but there&#39;s plenty wrong with
    Bodoni or Mrs Eaves for a newspaper text faces. Most Bodonis are made from Bodoni&#39;s
    display sizes - not his text sizes &#40;ITC Bodoni 6 is one of the few exceptions,
    but it has a very dark colour&#41;. This makes most Bodonis unsuitable for the
    setting of long text. There&#39;s also a cultural thing here as well - if you
    were publishing in France, say, they have a cultural legacy of modern faces used
    for materials like novels - but in English-speaking countries your average reader
    expects faces derived more from transitional sources. Since you probably have
    no budget, I&#39;d suggest picking up Melior. It&#39;s oft-neglected, but it&#39;s
    got a nice high x-height &#40;an important consideration as mentioned earlier&#41;
    and a pleasing, slightly square anatomy.'

  body: 'Both Mrs Eaves and Bodoni are bad as newspaper faces: Mrs Eaves has a really
    small x-height so it always looks smaller than it is, and Bodoni has a vertical
    contrast and fine hairlines that are easily lost when printed with a coarse process
    on coarse paper. Try Matthew Carter&#39;s ITC Charter. It would work fantastically
    on newsprint and it&#39;s way underused. Others suggested are great too. <BR>
    <BR>I agree with bj about Gotham. It&#39;s beautiful and would make a smashing
    headline face. These two families are all you need. Forget about Futura; it&#39;s
    clich'

    Could you elaborate? As for the name, it&#39;s The Tartan, as Gordon has some
    sort of Scottish root. Last year, the first year we used Modern No. 20 &#40;Times
    New Roman for the whole damn paper before that&#41;, it was typed like this: &#34;the
    TARTAN&#34;, which I like better than just plain ol&#39; &#34;The Tartan&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>&#62;Hey Zach, is the paper printed on newsprint? Do you have an existing
    masthead you must use? If so, please post an image thanks <BR>Ly: Yes, newsprint,
    11x17. No, no existing masthead we must use. We&#39;re not quite that established,
    and I don&#39;t like the masthead from last year. Though if we kept the font &#40;M.N.20&#41;
    it would give us some continuity. &#40;But if it&#39;s a bad idea artistically,
    it&#39;s a bad idea. It works for the Nation magazine though...&#41; <BR> <BR>'

    about 1600 copies, weekly. <BR> <BR>&#62;2. # of pages?  <BR>Probably 12 or 16,
    though I can&#39;t be sure because a lot will be changing from last year. Maybe
    20 some weeks. <BR> <BR>&#62;3. b&amp;w? color?  <BR>Black and white. <BR> <BR>&#62;4.
    pictures? illustrations? - yes - what kind or style? no - why not?  <BR>We have
    the usual amount of photos. We just got a $1000 digital camera and a $500 high-speed
    lens, so we may have good quality photos this year. We will also start this year
    having other artwork -- op-ed and feature illustrations, cartoons. <BR> <BR>&#62;5.
    what kind of layout? grid?  <BR>Five columns, 2 in. each, on 11x17 newsprint.
    Margins and gutters TBA. Don&#39;t know nothing &#39;bout grids... I saw something
    about them in a layout book I&#39;ve been reading, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll
    have the energy to figure them out before school starts. But layout was hell last
    year so maybe I should. <BR> <BR>&#62;6. what kind of space - headline, picture,
    text ?  <BR>I don&#39;t know what you mean... Nothing is really established. Last
    year&#39;s layout/design was OK but not great, and definitely is not staying.

    newspaper is not like magazine.  <BR>Oh but I wish it &#42;was&#42; a magazine...
    But you could probably tell all that from the typeface ideas I had. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> I really don&#39;t care for news much at all -- at least
    the kind of news we usually cover &#40;&#34;New Dorm Unveiled&#34;&#41;. I wish
    we could just do arts, editorials, and op-eds. And look like either Harper&#39;s
    or Radar.  <BR> <BR>To everyone: I will look at all those fonts you people suggested.
    I think I may even be able to give up Futura, if there&#39;s something good. I
    just really really don&#39;t want to use Helvetica or Franklin Gothic... what
    do you think about Akzidenz Grotesk? Or Interstate? &#40;which someone mentioned
    that as overused on the Overused thread...&#41; <BR> <BR>Oh, important note: we
    do in fact have $ to spend... I&#39;m prepared to spend up to 400-500 if it&#39;s

  body: Zach - by &#34;custom&#34; I mean do not simply set TARTAN  <BR>in a font
    and call it your flag. Treat it like a logo, or <BR>as Jay-W would say, a trademark.
    <BR> <BR>Treat it with care, space it tighter <BR>than you would a headline, look
    for harmonious combinations <BR>with your TA combo, which appears twice. <BR>
    <BR>btw, Jim Parkinson is one of many flag experts. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typedesign.com"
    target="_blank">www.typedesign.com</a> <BR> <BR>Also, I think nameplate and flag
    are interchangeable, <BR>while masthead refers to the staff listings commonly
    <BR>put inside, typically near the op-ed page.
