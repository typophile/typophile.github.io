    I belong to a few forums, and to make something bold I only need to put a double
    underscore before and after the word.\r\n\r\nWho would be the person responsible
    for implementing a simplified version of the current old fashioned HTML style?"

  body: "Discussion of this topic is long overdue. Pick up a bone.\r\n\r\nReally,
    HTML syntax is a positively archaic ancestor of the simplified text formatting
    the rest of the web moved on to years ago. Wiki-style syntax is the future for
    things like bold and italic. By comparison HTML sytax is not merely \"too complicated\",
    it's primitive and obsolete. Typing two underscores or two inch marks is much
    easier, and it makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nTypophile and Punchcut are clinging
    to a standard that will soon be redundant. For a community that is supposedly
    type central, this kind of thing started to get embarrassing several years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>If
    you find remembering/typing HTML too complicated, you can always use tools like
    TextExpander, RapidoWrite or Typinator. With them, you can type \u201C__\u201D
    or whatever you have configured, and it will automatically replace that with [strong][/strong],
    and even place the cursor between those tags, if you want so.</em>\r\n\r\nHe shouldn't
    have to resort to such ludicrous methods and neither should anyone else.\r\n\r\n<em>Can
    we have some more HTML elements, please? blockquote, first and foremost. The availability
    of del, ins or abbr would not be amiss either.</em>\r\n\r\nI think we should have
    more elements like that but not in HTML please. Let's move with the times.\r\n\r\n<em>And
    as this is a typographic forum, I can see quite a few reasonable applications
    for i and b: Not every italicization is meant to be an emphasis.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's
    an arbitrary and not very meaningful distinction. i tags produce the same formatting
    as em, and b tags produce the same formatting as strong. What's the point? None
    that can be discerned, except b and i are to type. Nobody reading it will see
    any difference. Besides which b and i are ageing, non-standard, non-compliant
    Mozilla extensions.\r\n\r\n<em>C\u2019mon, give it a break! :D</em>\r\n\r\nC'mon
    and give users a break, and move with the times. No wonder typophiles and the
    type industry hang onto outmoded terminology like \"sans serif\".\r\n\r\nPick
    up a bone and throw it into the sky. Watch it spin off into space.\r\n\r\nj a

    For example, when you upload an image to the Typophile server, it gives you the

    syntax instead of the cumbersome and time-consuming <strong>href=\"yada-yada.gif\"</strong>.\r\n\r\nDoes
