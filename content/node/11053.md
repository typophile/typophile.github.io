  body: Linotype. Linotype Univers has the &#34;european&#34; ampersand which was
    part of the original design. Adobe &#40;and Linotype&#41; should have put this
    in as an alternate in the OpenType versions, but of course they didn&#39;t.

    <BR>There&#39;s a shifty post at the bottom that makes the Et aperstand sound
    like a narcotic. <BR> <BR>R'
