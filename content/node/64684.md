  non-ligning figures (6,9) are throwing me off, could they be from an altogether
  different family?  It's printed offset litho. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nfb"

    as its not been set as fixed width, because the majority of text in the specimen
    I have has been set fully justified.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nFontgrube."
