body: "In a <e href=\"http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressreleases/200508/081505OpenTypeISO.html\">press
  release</a> issued today, it was announced that the International Standards Organisation
  (ISO) is to adopt OpenType as the basis for a new open font format within the MPEG-4
  multimedia standard. In practical terms, what I understand this to mean is that
  the current 4.1 version of the OpenType specification will be adopted as an ISO
  standard, subject the the same processes for extension and revision as other ISO
  standards. In other words, Microsoft and Adobe will not own this version of the
  specification in the same way that they have in the past.\r\n\r\nI believe, but
  am not sure, that this agreement does not cover OpenType Layout features, which
  are an appendix to the font format specification and are, in a sense, a particular
  implementation of the format rather than part of the format itself. This means that
  registering of new layout features would not require an ISO review and balloting
  process."

    As mentioned on the other thread the final decision on what's in the ISO spec
    and what will be externally referenced is still TBD.   "
