  body: Hi Tiffany, <BR> <BR>That&#39;s perfect, you&#39;re right about that. It will
    take a little while before the site is finished. I only wanted to have a list
    of people that could be interested, and would like me to keep them informed when
    it&#39;s ready. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try also to write you a little text to publish.
    Phoei, that will be difficult... <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>
