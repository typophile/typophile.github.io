  body: "Cool stuff. I wonder if that A is a southpaw A, or if someone just accidentally
    flipped the stencil. I couldn\u2019t find any stenciled moderns that looked similar.
    Bodoni/Didot share the basic construction, but the details differ. \r\n\r\nWith
    the proper permission, you can always have someone digitize it. "

  body: "I think <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_grande\">Greta Grande</a>,
    by Peter Bi\u013Eak and Nikola Djurek, would be a wonderful candidate to stencilize
    to make something with a similar feel.  Although I like it the way it comes too.\r\n\r\nI
    looked in the Solotype Catalog to see if there was a version of this Bogler design,
    but nothing even close. I notice two different styles of S in the images posted
    (45462's S has no serifs, but 45468's does).\r\n\r\nI realize 'Bauhaus' in this
    instance refers to the design movement and studio, if that's the right term, but
    in terms of typography this isn't quite what I generally think of. Usually Bauhaus-style
    is simplified, geometric, rounded, and sans-serif. If I just saw this typeface,
    I would say 'Art Deco', and of course, they were overlapping time periods.\r\n\r\n-

    odd. Had never considered it could be the product of a left hand. But does this
    remain true for the rest of the letters?\r\n\r\nMike: It's not hugely consistent
    is it? Adds to the charm. I love the 'S's in 45462."

    Wonderful stuff. The reversed stress on the A helps the look of "KAFFEE" but hurts
    the look of "SALZ". Too bad they didn''t get it completely right. '

    shares a lot of sensibilities with the samples--although, admittedly, the inline
    treatment kind of mucks up the overall effect.

    thinking was a huge leap forward from 19th century modern types.\r\n\r\nIn my
