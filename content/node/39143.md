  know what the font is for the tv show House MD? \r\n\r\nA quick google search had
  folks at Myfonts saying it was Futura demi, Century Gothic or Twentieth Century.
  I don't know whether its a mixture of them all or that the font was adapted. I will
  keep searching but thought I'd ask here to see whether anyone knew it. \r\n\r\nBec.\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://www.quickstopentertainment.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/housetitle.jpg]]"
