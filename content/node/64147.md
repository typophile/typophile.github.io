  will dump a TTF font file to editable text? \r\n\r\nIdeally, I want an extensive
  Asian Unicode font (like SimHei for example) to be dumped to a text file that looks
  just like the Character Map (a grid that's 10 or so characters wide and several
  hundred rows tall), but in editable text (DOC, RTF, TXT, whatever works). \r\n\r\nI'm
  trying to do it using the copy and paste function in Character Map but it's taking
  way too long. Is there a utility out there that will do something like this for
  me in an automated manner? I'm willing to pay a decent price."

    Font Development Kit for OpenType. It might help:\r\n\r\n<cite>fontplot</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>Make
    a pdf file showing all the glyphs in the font. This fills a page with many glyphs,
    and shows just the filled outlines at a small point size, with some info around
    each glyph. Works with OpenType fonts and Type 1 fonts.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>\"charplot\",
    \"digiplot\", \"fontplot\", \"hintplot\", and \"showfont\" are all command files
    that call the ProofPDF script with different options. ProofPDF takes as options
    a list of fonts, and an optional list of glyphs, and prints a PDF file for the
    specified font. showing the glyphs as specified by options.</cite>\r\n\r\nDo you
    want to print the character map or do you want to dump the font file? If you want
    to dump (decompile) it, TTX is right. Otherwise I don\u2019t know, in which way
    TTX should be a help there.\r\n\r\n<strong>I am not sure, whether fontplot works
    with TrueType fonts.</strong> I assume, it does not, although OpenType fonts can

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions and assistance everyone. None of these ideas helped
    but maybe with a bit more refinement of my original question, someone will have
    a different suggestion.\r\n\r\nAric, I work in home video subtitling so all my
    text needs to be rendered as a bitmap or other graphic image for client delivery.
    I need all the characters dumped from a font to text so I can load them into my
    rendering engine (which runs on proprietary Unicode text-based files), render
    them out to graphics, and QC the outputs. \r\n\r\nAntonio, thanks for the suggestion.
    TTX seems helpful, but I think it's giving me all the stuff behind the scenes
    to make the characters work (for programming, compiling, etc), whereas I just
    need the characters themselves. \r\n\r\nArno, thanks to you for the suggestion
    as well. I think I found a couple of other programs that do the same thing yesterday
    (dump to a printable PDF), but again since I can't actually use the text from
    the PDF in my editing software, it isn't exactly what I need. \r\n\r\nIdeally
    I just need content like this:\r\n\r\n!\"#$%&'()*+,-./01234\r\n\r\nThat's the
    first row of the character map from Arial, copied one-by-one with the select button
    and then copied to the clipboard, and pasted here. \r\n\r\nFor Arial, it won't
    be such a big deal, but SimHei has 16,000 characters, so I was hoping to find
    something that would do it a bit quicker. \r\n\r\nAny further ideas would be warmly
    welcomed. I thank you all for your time thus far."

    of the font file with TTX (-t cmap). Then use a search&replace tool.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n&lt;cmap>\r\n
    \ &lt;tableVersion version=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;cmap_format_4 platformID=&quot;0&quot;

    name=&quot;quotedbl&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- QUOTATION MARK --&gt;\r\n\r\nshould look
    like this (without underscores):\r\n&_#x20;\r\n&_#x21;\r\n&_#x22;\r\n\r\nOpenOffice
    Writer wants to have them at least in a html element. So you should have this
    in the end (without underscores):\r\n&lt;p&gt;&_#x20;&_#x21;&_#x22;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\nStore
    it as html file and open it in Word or OpenOffice Writer or anything comparable
    and save it as doc or rtf file. Word and Writer will display the glyphs then (and
    naturally your browser), as long as the font is installed and selected (with the
    font menu or a CSS declaration).\r\n\r\nFor the case, that this does not work,
    it might help you to find the right way. I am not sure, whether the cmap table
    necessarily contains the Unicode positions of all characters of the font. But
    I assume, you neither would be able to get access to characters, that are not
    in the CMAP table with their Unicode positions, with the help of the clipboard.\r\n\r\nAnd
    probably there is a more elegant way."

  body: "Arno, you are correct: Window's Charmap utility does not display \"all\"
    characters in a font, just those with a valid Unicode mapping (it does not show
    OTF substitution results). I agree that it's a moot point, since the <em>input</em>
    of Jason's program should be Unicode :-)\r\n\r\nA one-step solution could be a
    program that immediately dumps the Unicode CMAP to a file (there might be more
    than one encoding in any font). I wrote lots of little programs to examine TTFs
    and OTFs -- I'll have a quick look-see if it's possible to re-purpose one to do
    this. Hold on a minute."

    a Mac and that may work on a PC with Cygwin.\r\n\r\nI always use small scripts.
    The following one outputs the unicode numbers (in hex format) in a font; it requires
    Fontforge, the Python Fontforge module and, of course, Python. Copy what is between
    the cut lines and paste in a terminal window (Cygwin, mac or Linux), and this
    creates the executable file <code>lstucodes</code> in the current directory.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n----\r\ncat
    > lstucodes <<'EOF'\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n\r\nimport fontforge,sys\r\nfnt=fontforge.open(sys.argv&#91;1&#93;,1)\r\n\r\nfor
    g in fnt.glyphs():\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; if (g.unicode &gt;= 0x21):\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; print \"%04X\" % (g.unicode)\r\nEOF\r\nchmod 755 lstucodes\r\n----</code>\r\n\r\nIf
    <code>simhei.ttf</code>  is also in the current directory then\r\n\r\n<code>./lstucodes
    simhei.ttf |sort &gt; simhei.txt </code> \r\n\r\noutputs all the unicode values
    of the characters in simhei.ttf, sorts them and puts the result in <code>simhei.txt</code>.
    \r\n\r\nTo format, I usually use sed and awk but young people use other things
    now. Anyway, here is my script (if I want 10 characters per line); again, copy
    and paste in the terminal window to get hex2html:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n---\r\ncat
    > hex2html <<'EOF'\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\nawk 'BEGIN{print \"&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;\"}{\r\n&nbsp;
    printf \"&amp;#x%s;\\n\", $0\r\n&nbsp; n = n+1\r\n&nbsp; if (n == 10) {\r\n&nbsp;
    &nbsp; printf \"&lt;br&gt;\\n\"\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; n=0\r\n&nbsp; }\r\n}END{ printf
    \"&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\\n\"}'&nbsp; $1\r\nEOF\r\nchmod 755 hex2html\r\n---\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNow
    <code>./hex2html simhei.txt &gt; simhei.html</code> gives the file that you can
    find here: <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/simhei.html\"><strong>simhei.html</strong></a>.\r\n\r\nCharacters
    with a unicode number above FFFF cause problem. If you find other problems, I'd

    <code>~/bin</code> folder.\r\n\r\nI now took the time to compare with Arno's method.
    On tens of thousands of characters, comparing outputs can be quite instructive.
    Looking at <code>stxihei.ttx</code>, I see only one cmap table, of type 12; there
    are 34962 character codes (and 31 multiply encoded glyphs).\r\n\r\nFor each line
    containing <code>'map code'</code> we want the string enclosed between the first
    and the second quote character. That can be done with <code>awk</code>, telling
    it to use quote as a field separator. In any unix-like shell, typing\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>\r\ngrep
    'map code' stxihei.ttx&nbsp; | awk -F\\\" '{print $2}' | sed 's/0x//' &gt; stxihei.txt\r\n</code>\r\n\r\ndoes
    it (and removes the leading 0x). Then (using the hex2html script above)\r\n\r\n<code>hex2html
    stxihei.txt &gt; stxihei.html</code> \r\n\r\ngives the desired html file, 10 characters
    per line.\r\n\r\nAfter comparing the output from FontForge and the above, one
    can see that on multiply encoded glyphs in stxihei, FontForge outputs only one
    unicode value per glyph (I checked with a script). Arno's method based on the
    ttx output gives all the unicode values in that font and that may be what you
    want.\r\n\r\nOn other ttx files, with multiple cmap tables, I don't know what
    may occur. For some other font, I saw unicode points with <code>.notdef</code>
    glyphs (that would need to be discarded with grep -v). What else?\r\n\r\nMichel"
