  it in digital?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rapha_ItalianType2small_3845.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking
  at the three faces in this image. Perhaps these are metal or hot-metal face? Not
  sure when Italian newspapers went to offset or photo type.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rapha_ItalianType1asmall_5195.jpg]"

    correction in case it helps.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rapha_ItalianType2_5949.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
    looks like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/soft-press/\">Soft
    Press</a> by Canada Type is pretty close to your sample though not exact."

  body: '@tylor.reimer - Thanks. It looks more like Press Gothic than Soft Press likely
    due to softening of type/process of newspaper printing. The original face may
    be Metropol designed by Aldo Novarese for Nebiolo in 1967.'

    perhaps it\u2019s Metropol (see the description here: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/press-gothic/).\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I\u2019m slow, and don\u2019t refresh pages."

  body: "Thanks to those who have offer suggestions and help so far. The biggest issue
    I am running into is that these were either wood, metal, or hot-metal typefaces

    not 100% EXACTLY like the original versions. \r\n\r\nSo far, this is what I have
