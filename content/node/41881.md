  body: "\"Invisible Sans\"?\r\n\r\nEd, It looks like you need to find a smaller type
    sample, if it didn't attach, and maybe using a more descriptive title in smaller,
    less aggressive, type would be helpful and polite. For example, is the font you
    'see everywhere' a sans serif or serif font? What wording is in your sample? This
    would identify your question better and attract people who know those styles to
    look at it.\r\n\r\nBTW, this comment about more descriptive titles is directed
    at all posters. There are several advantages to being specific, not the least
    of which is that the moderators are less likely to change it for you into something
    you may not recognize. \"What is this font?\", or anything like it, is really
    useless, especially if 12 people use the same thing.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
