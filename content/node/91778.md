body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm launching a blog called Typositor. As if the world needs
  another design or type blog. But I plan to focus on pre-digital Graphic Arts technology
  and workers on a regular basis, so I'm hoping it will be a slightly different voice.\r\n\r\nIf
  you remember, and especially if you used the VGC Typositor in its heyday, I'm wondering
  if you might comment on any technical aspects of this maiden article. A few xxx's
  are in place as I need to fill some research holes, but I'd love anyone's two cents
  on any aspect of this piece.  http://typophile.com/node/91777 As new blog posts
  here don't seem to be highlighted as they were on the old site, I thought I'd put
  this out there as a forum topic as well. \r\n\r\nI'm also looking for images of
  the machine, which are very rare on the web. If anyone has leads in that department
  please let me know.\r\nMany thanks in advance. \r\n\r\nPatrick King\r\n"
