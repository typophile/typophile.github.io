body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate some feedback on a font I'm designing.\r\n\r\nI've
  had an appreciation of typography for a long time, but this is the first time I've
  tried to create a font. My wife, a graphic designer, was lamenting her lack of a
  good lettering font, so I'm hoping to surprise her for Christmas :)\r\n\r\nThe plan
  I'm working to is:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Not a cursive writing style, but...</li>\r\n<li>...mustn't
  look like a <em>comic-book</em> lettering font</li>\r\n<li>Casual style, obviously
  handwritten, but not sloppy or childish; perhaps like notes written in a sketchbook</li>\r\n<li>Reasonable
  legibility</li>\r\n<li>Normal weight, written with a pen</li>\r\n<li>'Black' weight,
  written with a fat marker - obviously less casual to improve readability with a
  fat marker.</li>\r\n<li>Time permitting, a neater variant, like you might use when
  filling in a form</li>\r\n<li>Reasonably full set of glyphs - plenty of punctuation;
  accented variants of letters as used in French, Spanish, German, Italian, etc; Greek
  letters; Hopefully a few maths symbols</li>\r\n<li>OpenType format</li>\r\n<li>If
  possible, completed in time for Christmas!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI'm working by drawing
  the glyphs on paper, and then creating outlines in FontForge; I'm not wanting to
  buy any expensive tools, and FontForge seems pretty fully featured.\r\n\r\nI've
  attached an image below of where I'm at. I've created most of the lowercase glyphs,
  but I've not done any tidying, or got the widths or kerning sorted out. Some of
  the letters (m, n, s) look a little short - or should the rounded letters be a little
  lower?\r\n\r\nI notice that some of the line widths are a rather irregular (I'm
  thinking of the a, t, and tail of the g); that actually reflects what a Pilot G2
  pen does on paper when I write... (perhaps I need more practice!) I'd like to keep
  the feel of a pen on paper, but I think I'll reduce the contrast of the irregularities
  to a more reasonable level, so that letters don't stand out.\r\n\r\nIs there a list
  of which glyphs are needed for which languages?\r\n\r\nObviously, this is very much
  in the early stages, but I'd appreciate any tips, suggestions, constructive criticisms,
  or observations.\r\n\r\ndan\r\n"
