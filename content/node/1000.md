  body: The narratives on top of the images? They&#39;re a serif  <BR>face, not a
    sans, if those are what you mean. Looks  <BR>like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/janson-text/"
    target="_blank"> Janson Text</a>, the 1985 revival by Adrian Frutiger,  <BR>based
    on Nicholas Kis&#39; 1690 faces.

    someone even when they&#39;re right... especially after all your boasting on the
    scoreboard threads! We could turn the Type ID Board into the Defame Yves Board....
    hmmm. '

    <BR> <BR>Whoops, it appears I crossed a line here. I profusely  <BR>apologize
    for sounding like the arrogant bastard I actualy  <BR>am, and I&#39;ll try to
    behave in the future. Sorry Colin,  <BR>really didn&#39;t mean to &#40;honestly&#41;.
