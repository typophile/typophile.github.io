  <a href=\"http://www.atypi.org/05_Petersburg/20_main_program/view_presentation_html?presentid=451\">ATYPI
  '08</a> programme will include a showing of Punchcut's Typophile Film Fest 4. \r\n\r\nThe
  one-hour selection of short typographic films hail from Portugal, The Netherlands,
  Austria, Canada and the US. The films create a visual mashup of motion design, typographic
  animation and short stories. The Film Fest includes broadcast motion design, documentaries
  and typographic eye candy from Trollb\xE4ck + Company, Strange Attractors, Heebok
  Lee, Nick Shinn, Juan Leguizamon as well as exclusive interviews and cuts from the
  acclaimed documentary film <em>Helvetica</em>. \r\n\r\nOn a personal note, I'm thrilled
  to say this festival will be presented in a friggin' palace. \r\n\r\nDETAILS\r\nThe
  Film Fest will be presented at Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace, St Petersburg, Russia.
  Admission is limited to ATYPI '08 Conference attendees. \r\n\r\nThe Typophile Film
  Fest 4 debuted at TypeCon2007 in Seattle. We've shown it subsequently in San Francisco
  and have plans to unveil it in other cities. If you'd like to host a showing, give
  us a shout."
