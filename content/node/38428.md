  help me, how to properly cenetr numbers on Sanah U+0601 in MS Volt?\r\n\r\nIs it
  done by single adjustment or pair adjustment? and How\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\nAtif\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is indeed a tricky piece of work. The positioning is done using a series
    of contextual single adjustments to the positioning of the numerals, all associated
    with the 'kern' feature. The first lookup shifts an isolated numeral relative
    to a preceding context sanah glyph. This handles the case of a single numeral.
    The second lookup shifts the first numeral further (adjustments in separate lookups
    are cumulative) relative to a preceding context sanah and following context second
    numeral. The third lookup shifts the second numeral relative to a preceding context
    sanah and the first numeral. These two lookups handle the case of two numerals
    on the sign. And so on. One ends up with a series of ten lookups to handle up
    to four numerals, which will do us for the next few thousand years.\r\n\r\nNote
    that all this relies on monospaced numerals. Obviously the lookup adjustment values
    are relative to the widths of the glyphs.\r\n\r\nIn the Adobe Arabic fonts, we
    further complicated the issue by including two different sanah widths: one for
    1-3 numerals and one for 4 numerals. The latter is contextually substituted using
    the 'calt' feature prior to positioning.\r\n\r\nAdobe have generously made the
    VOLT source project for the Adobe Arabic Regular font available via Tom Phinney's
    blog:\r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/06/adobe_arabic_sa.html\r\n\r\nIf
    you were to generate a TTF version of the Adobe Arabic font, you could open it
    in VOLT and import the project file to see how the lookups work. This is probably
    simpler than my trying to explain it."

  body: The Adobe Arabic font ships with version 7.0.5 and later of Acrobat. If you
    check the Fonts folder in the Acrobat program directory, you should find the font.
    Note that this is a CFF OpenType font, which will not rasterise in VOLT. In order
    to view the imported project file, you will need to make a TTF version of the
    font in e.g. FontLab.
