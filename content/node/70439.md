    Eurostile Bold Extended, or Microgramma.

  body: "That reminds me a lot of a very old typeface revived by Solotype (and once
    also found in the Image Club collection) called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/bamboo/normal/charmap.html\">Bamboo</a>.
    To me this looks like something you might find on a freebie site, but it could
    easily be a custom font done by anyone, maybe even a band member,  who used a
    blobby felt-tip.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega "
