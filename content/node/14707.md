  and clarity. Does anyone know what it is? Where I can get it? Who's done it?

  body: "You're right George. I was pretty chuffed when I first saw Chevin used for
    a Royal Mail advert. I was stunned when I realised the entire family had been
    adopted as the RM corporate typeface, and is used for absolutely everything.\r\n\r\nJames,
    I know what you mean about Post Office queues - don't you just love slowly snaking
    your way to the counter. Position number 5 please!\r\n\r\nI'm glad you like Chevin.
    It's available in the UK from Fontworks. - www.type.co.uk\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
