body: "I am working on a redesign for the printed version of [[http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine|<em>Skeptic</em>
  magazine]]. The magazine is published by the Skeptics Society \u2014 a nonprofit
  501(c)(3) educational organization that promotes science literacy and critical thinking.
  Supported by leading scientists, scholars, journalists and magicians, the society
  investigates fringe science and paranormal claims.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that
  the median age of our readers is approximately 50. Most of our readers have one
  degree, while over half have two or more degrees. About 70% of our readers are male.
  Interestingly, most of our readers are more highly educated than those who read
  <em>Scientific American.</em>\r\n\r\n<em>Skeptic</em> magazine has had much the
  same design for the last 15 years, and it's time to freshen it up, modernize, and
  attract a larger audience \u2014 a challenge, no doubt. We'd like to have the readership
  of some of the big names like: <em>Discover</em>, <em>Scientific American</em>,
  and <em>Popular Science</em>, but with limited print budgets, and very minimal advertising,
  we cannot match the production values of those publications. Also, our magazine
  is much more text-heavy.\r\n\r\nI am interested in a critique of the overall design.
  Do you think the body copy / heading combination works? I understand it is not traditional
  to use a sans-serif face for body copy. I've identified [[http://www.linotype.com/255715/optimanovabasic2-valuepack.html|Optima
  nova]] for body copy, body headings and photo captions, and [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/parry_family/|Parry]]
  for main headings. Optima, even though it is a sans-serif, has subtle variations
  in the strokes of its letterforms. In the sample PDF provided here, I use a non-pro
  version of Optima, so, unfortunately, it is lacking many of the essentials of the
  Open-Type version such as: ligatures, old-style numerals, and small-caps. The body
  copy is set at 8.5 pt over 12 pt. The table of contents was a challenge in that
  we wanted to condense it down from two full pages into one. It uses Optima at 6.5,
  7.75 and 8.5 pts over 10pt leading.\r\n\r\nSo far, the redesign only covers the
  main sections of the magazine that are printed black text on white, uncoated stock.
  Ignore the quality of the images in this PDF: they are just low-res previews.\r\n\r\nI
  would really appreciate any thoughtful feedback you are willing to share. Please
  ask any questions you need answered in order to respond."

    the readers are well educated you don't have to treat it like a white paper or
    one of those sorts of documents. the enjoy a diversion and to be entertained and
    engaged like the general public, not hokey-jokey with wacky fonts and useless
    elements, but more in the spirit of giving them a visual package that makes them
    stop and absorb what they're reading rather than having just another publication
    from work or school.\r\n\r\nthe rag right with indents and no paragraph spacing
    along with with narrow column gap makes it difficult to feel a good flow down
    the page. i recommend to either widen the gap or space out the paragraph blocks
    to remedy that.\r\n\r\nthe kerning on optima makes the body copy feel dense. are
    you closing it up or is it the default variation of the font you are using? \r\n\r\ni'd
    recommend opening up the kerning a little and at least one more point of leading.
    you have a fair amount of whitespace in the outside edges of the pages and i think
    a little more will keep the page flowing better, give it some more air so to speak.\r\n\r\nthanks
    for sharing it with us and i hope the advice will help you with the redesign.

  body: "Thanks you for your comments, Troy. It's interesting that you should point
    out 1) space between paragraphs, and 2) leading. The first few drafts had more
    leading and had space between each paragraph, with no indents. Paragraph spaces
    were removed and leading was slightly reduced to increase the wordcount per page
    so that it was consistent with the wordcount in past issues. I can see that with
    the ample margins I have, there is room to expand into that white space. We are
    considering adding pages to the magazine to accommodate more art, and more breathing
    room overall.\r\n\r\nI haven't adjusted the tracking on body copy at all; that's
    Optima's default. However, since the version of Optima in the sample PDF is not
    pro open-type, I will hold off from adjusting the density until I see what the
    pro version looks like. As a general rule, I try to avoid tracking out professional
    typefaces used for body copy. "

  body: "Optima is the wrong face for this project. I can understand why you would
    want to use it, because it really is a fabulous text face for high-end book design,
    but in this context it feels like low-end corporate design. You need to pick something
    that livens up the black-and-white, text-heavy layouts. Parry is a nice face,
    but I don\u2019t see how it relates at all to the design sensibility of this project
    or to Optima. <a href=\"http://jpad.biz/index.php?/whateley-magazine/\">I did
    a pretty lively B&W journal design using nothing but the Museo and Fontin Families.</a?
    Jos has released Museo Sans and Calluna which would make things even more interesting.
    \r\n\r\nYou need to get out and look at some interesting contemporary magazine
    designs. Right now this looks like an in-house corporate journal from five years
    ago. \r\n\r\nYou should also be designing this with real copy. Lorem ipsum looks
    really boring in black-and-white. "

    been criticized for its loose metrics, but I think its slight eccentricities might
    work well in this context as a head face, with the very readable Arnhem for body.
    I think I'd like this better than Parry, and Ludwig has a good range of variations,
    which could be useful."

  body: Optima is a font that people tend to use because they see it as a bland design
    that occupies a space between sans and serif. So when you use it in a low-budget,
    text-heavy magazine you end up with a design that looks like a lot of low-budget,
    boring, inoffensive corporate graphics. To really make Optima sing it needs to
    be blown up in a large book on fine paper that echoes the monumental renaissance
    feel of the face.

  body: "Optima has a cleanness and rationality about it, which suits the concept
    of the magazine, but I think is not best as a text font--as others have also argued.
    Also note the Optima Nova, which has some improvements, especially for text. \r\n\r\nIf
    you want the cleanness and rationality in a serif text font, Whitman is very good.
    I don't know how it works at those sizes, but I'm sure Font Bureau could help
    you out on that. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Regarding the point size and tracking question, most common digital text
    typefaces of the 80s and 90s were optimized for 12 point. There are exceptions,
    but that's a good working theory until/unless one knows better. Of course, the
    eye is the ultimate arbiter of spacing.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'll just agree on everything
    said above about Optima. Don't get me wrong, it's a great typeface, and was incredibly
    innovative 50 years ago. But like a number of other great typefaces which have
    been over-used, it bears a certain amount of baggage. For example, the fact that
    it has long been the overwhelming choice of the cosmetics industry makes it feel
    \"just wrong\" for representing rationality and skepticism, to me.... I think
    I want something a little more sturdy/practical feeling. Most of the other suggestions
    do well on that score.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "William (Bull) -- For real-world examples of Whitman in use, you might want
    to pick up a copy of the current <em>Women's Health</em> at your newsstand. The
    October 2009 issue marks the debut of a new design utilizing Whitman extensively.
    \r\n\r\nIt looks like Whitman is used generally at about 10 pt in running text.
    I believe that 10-point Whitman approximates the x-height of 8.5-point Optima.\r\n\r\nMostly
    their columns are narrower than yours, I think. (Obviously, this a very different
    style of magazine layout). But on page 136, for instance, you'll find columns
    very similar in width to the 2-column layout on page 5 of your sample. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    the <em>Women's Health</em> type palette has Whitman combined with H&FJ's [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100034|Sentinel]],
    which has some general qualities similar to Parry. \r\n\r\nAs another possible
    reference for you, <em>Brides</em> magazine uses Whitman in some feature text
    and they have Parry in their palette. However, there's not a lot of serif text
    in this magazine, and I don't think the two end up sharing the stage much.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    FWIW: <em>Women's Health</em> uses [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008|Gotham]]
    for sans-serif. <em>Brides</em> uses [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Relay|Relay]].
    Both are pretty frequent and popular pairings for Whitman.\r\n\r\nI hope these
    examples are helpful to you. Let me know if I can be of further assistance.\r\n\r\n--
