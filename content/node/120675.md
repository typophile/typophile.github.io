  body: "There are quite a few blackletter fonts that could give you similar \"rather
    flourish-y\" effects, but almost none that are Italic. If you can slope the font
    yourself you can pick and choose.\r\nFor example, consider   Laura Worthington's
    Sepian http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/sepian/ or Paul Lloyd's
    Minister font http://fontpro.com/minster-font-14241 and  http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/

  body: "Thanks Don - despite it not being blackletter, I think that Blackstone is
    the best fit. Not sure I want to shell out the cash before trying it though. I'll
    continue on the hunt, you've been a lot of help and I may end up investing in
    that typeface.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
