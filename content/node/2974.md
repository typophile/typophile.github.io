    their website. Send them an email.

  body: Some time ago I have the Rotis-family in CE, Greek and Cyrillic produced.
    Even the Italic styles of the SemiSerif &#40;!&#41;. I have it offered M&#42;&#42;&#42;type.
    But these have said NO after long negotiations and many examples. Want to make
    an in-house development which shall be offered as of 2007-2008. So licenser is
    Agfa-Monotype. Linotype and FontShop but also have produced CE customizations
    of the Rotis in the past. Enquire there...
