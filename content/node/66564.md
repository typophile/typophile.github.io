    using the form \u201C&#091;&#091;url|word link&#093;&#093;\u201D will go back
    to displaying normally and not with the wiki symbol.\r\n\r\nThat and the \u201Csmartypants\u201D
    quote conversions will return."

  body: "(Don't know if that was present before:)\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nice if you
    could provide a title in the direct form, or alternatively, put the full URL in
    the title tag? Some browsers do display the full URL before clicking on it, others
    (my Safari) do not. I always wait a second before clicking <a href=\"http://www.bleb.org/cgi-bin/randomgoogle.cgi?n=2\">any
    random link</a>, to see if something useful pops up."

    that!\r\n\r\nI guess one can always use old style &lt;a href..> notation if one
    feels to show a <em title=\"Oh ye smartypants, descriptions are possible on some
    unexpected places!\">popup</em>. (Go ahead, hover yer mouse over that italic word!)"
