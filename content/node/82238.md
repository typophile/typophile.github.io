  body: Custom lettering, but probably based on heavy weights of Kabel and Futura.
    The E, T and L are very Kabel-esque with their slanted terminals. The design is
    from 1977.

  body: "Not the ITC version, the original: <a href=\"http://myfonts.us/td-cgFcd9\">Kabel
    Black</a>.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally, over the weekend I listened to a podcast interview
    with the guy who designed this logo, Peter Kleinman. In it he reveals that he
    was in the preliminary stages of thinking about the logo, just playing around
    with some Kabel type that he cut out. He thought the concept was dumb because
    it was so literal. The publisher happened to walk in, pulled it off his drawing
    table, and returned a short while later to say it was approved.\r\n\r\nIf anyone's
    interested in listening, <a href=\"http://www.radioexiles.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=614:bookmarks-mark-chats-with-pete-kleinman-from-national-lampoon&catid=72&Itemid=172\">here's
    a link</a>. (Warning: possibly NSFW) "
