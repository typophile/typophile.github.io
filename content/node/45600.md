  a hobby when you discuss it with them?

    human weakness really. With a light laugh, forgive & forget - I say. \r\n\r\nYou
    know what you are: A type designer!"

    )

  body: "No, I am not a plumber. I just use that as a coctail party answer to certain
    people who seem like they might be boring or selfabsorbed. I use plumber because
    everyone knows exactly what they do and because boring selfcentered people don't
    want to talk to anyone like a plumber who can't be used to get them \"ahead\"
    in their career. Actually, my father was an electrician and I worked for him in
    my youth so I am no stranger to construction trades. People who would be happy
    to talk with a plumber or tradesman, I do like to talk with, however, because
    they are not phonies.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
