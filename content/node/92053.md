  design a new currency symbol for it. When I first saw the euro symbol before that
  currency was introduced, I thought it looked quite impressive for being well-chosen.
  Imagine if there were to be a universal or global currency. What would its symbol
  look like? It would have to be different from the \"sputnik\" or generic currency
  symbol that already exists, and should resemble other currency symbols such as the
  euro, yen, dollar, pound sterling etc. Although I know that this should look terrifying
  (not terrific) to those who understand it, but why not have a look at one idea that
  I have had, and see whether you can think of a better concept. I could not fit the
  symbol for the pound into the design, as it is too asymmetrical.\r\n\r\nSome previous
  nodes that contain some relevant discussion on the Euro currency symbol requirements:\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/18616]]\r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/4148]]\r\n"

  body: That looks like it comes from some old sorcery book. That said, there is such
    a beast already. It's called a 'generic currency symbol' or some twaddle like
    that and looks like a circle with spokes poking out at the ordinal points.

    the circle with horizontal strikethroughs look too much like theta though? What
    about a capital G (for globe) with either two horizontal or two vertical lines
    going through it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "A line or two parallel lines through something is the common element that
    says \"this is a currency symbol.\" A new global currency would be best represented
    by something simple and easy to write quickly. (So, not a totem pole made of most
    other symbols, sorry.) I'd say a circle (for the globe) with two vertical lines
    through it. Allow for as much variance as the dollar sign has (just one line sometimes,
    break the lines to leave the inside uncrossed, make it a tiny superscript on a
    stick, whatever) or more (horizontal lines, why not). A closed phi \u03D5 could
    be used wherever encoding hasn't caught up \u2014 or indeed the generic \xA4 since
    it's not far from the idea and isn't being used for much else. It would always
    be placed at the start of the number, like the dollar and pound, because then,
    if it happens to look too much like a stroked zero, it won't change the number.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    I left the computer and Hrant got in before I hit Post \u2014 agreeing independent
    conclusions make it clear how self-evident this answer is.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: Goodness,
    no, not the power symbol! In whatever future this is supposed to take place, you'd
    want a clear distinction between \"on/off\" (touching this starts the thingy)
    and \"pay now\" (touching this will cost you money)."

    quite. The symbol which you describe needs to be followed by the name of a currency
    to create a symbol for that currency.\r\n\r\nSo it isn't the same as a symbol
    which by itself is the symbol for one particular currency, the World Currency."
