  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Another day, another logo. This time I&rsquo;m working on a logo for a friend&rsquo;s software company in Holland called &ldquo;Fishgrind&rdquo;. They create various types of software packages but to date have been specializing in software that runs audio visual projector and plasma screens in clubs and entertainment venues.</p>
<p>As you can imagine it&rsquo;s been a little tricky drawing any direct connections between the name and what the company actually does so I have mainly stuck to playing with letterforms and the fish reference.</p>
<p>After tossing around several potential ideas I have come down to one that seems reasonably solid, although I&rsquo;m still playing around with certain aspects such as typeface, weight and little fish glyphs.</p>
<p>Here is just a small progression of how the idea came about, as always all comments/suggestins are welcome.</p>

Its cool that your text can stand by itself. My only crit would be (for me) that the hook on the g is a little thin. Otherwise its a nicely executed idea.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice. Two suggestions, though: The &lsquo;fi&rsquo; looks a bit too tight for my taste – maybe you could move the f a little bit to the left to achieve the optical feeling that &lsquo;fi&rsquo; is as broad as the terminal &rsquo;d'. 
That would also result in the &lsquo;g&rsquo; being more centered, leaving space for optionally adding &lsquo;soft&rsquo; and &lsquo;ware&rsquo; below the actual logo to stress what the company is doing actually.
Greetings, sk</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it&rsquo;s great. I&rsquo;d exaggerate the hook a bit. What I really like is the conceptual tie to POP video displays, which are marketing devices to &lsquo;hook&rsquo; in potential consumers/customers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, here is the slightly revised edition with some different flavours. I wanted to add some colour to the logo since they primarily deal with software for clubs and entertainment venues. Maybe the colours are a little too bright and bubbly at the moment but I&rsquo;m still tweaking them. I widened the fi lig as much as I could without it starting to look silly and also thickened &amp; lengthened up the hook a little. Overall I&rsquo;m liking the way it&rsquo;s turning out.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>mmilo,</p>
<p>i like the mood your typography creates, but the fish aren&rsquo;t in the same style, so they jar me out of the logo itself.</p>
<p>further, while i like the typographic treatment of the fish hook, i don&rsquo;t see how it illustrates a fish &lsquo;grinder&rsquo;. i see it being a fish &lsquo;catcher&rsquo;.</p>
<p>lastly, since the parallel between fish and catching them, grinding them, or otherwise, really has no value when illustrating what the company actually does (software for audio visual projector systems), i&rsquo;d suggest you drop the fish hook and the fish.</p>
<p>instead, put your faith in the power of the fishgrinder moniker. the word itself, as dache pointed out above, carries a lot of illustrative power all by itself. you can still make the logo fun and iconic, by just giving the brand name creative typographic treatment.</p>
<p>i think your work is strong in its many different aspects, mmilo. i just think that you can fit them together better in this instance to create a more powerful, streamlined image/message.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is fun. I just have a few suggestions/ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The s needs some work. It is too geometric and the top slopes forward making it look as if it is falling over.</li>
<li>Do you need the literal hook? Isn&rsquo;t it enough that the <em>g</em> resembles a hook? What if you extended the tail a bit more? I think if you weren&rsquo;t quite as literal the fish wouldn&rsquo;t be as stylistically opposed to the typeface.</li>
<li>Can the fish be a little more assymetrically placed?</li>

<p>As I stated, I think there&rsquo;s a strong connection. You are &lsquo;realing in&rsquo; clients. &lsquo;baiting folks&rsquo; with POP presentations. Etc.</p>
<p>Cheesy? Maybe. But I like it.</p>
