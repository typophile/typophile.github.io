  goudys, and trajans and several other roman fonts.  Came close with PF Monumenta,
  but the serifs are different.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font-sample_5408.jpg]"

    by Adrian Frutiger.\r\n\r\nThese serifs are very distinctive, but not common.
    Your choice of Monumenta was about the only other I noticed with these serifs,
    and letterforms. This makes me wonder if some serif 'surgery' was done to make
    them look sharper. Are there any other words you have seen using this font?\r\n\r\n-

    product it might be prudent to purchase Augustea and remove the vectors that make
    it an open version.\r\nUPDATE: I just checked the vector outlines. Augustus is
    very sloppy compared to Augustea. The Linotype version of Augustea has about 388
    glyphs, many special characters and multilingual support. In this case you get
    what you pay for. \r\nDon "
