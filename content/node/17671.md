  been told it's most likely pre-digital. Thanks in advance-

    What was the reason for saying it was pre-digital?\r\n\r\nI have hunted through
    three volumes of Photo-Lettering catalogs, and the Solotype Catalog and the Phil's
    Photo book without seeing anything particularly close. (If you didn't start out
    with the pre-digital information, I would have guessed a freeware tech style font.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: 'Thanks for the responses, and I apologize for not giving complete information.  I
    was told that it was most likely 25+ years old, thus my assumption that it was
    originally pre-digital.  It''s quite possible--probable, even--that it is custom,
    but I wanted to make sure.  '
