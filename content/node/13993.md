  work you created while working at other shops? How do you deal with collaborative
  work? Too many details about what you've contributed can start to sound a little
  crazy.\r\n\r\nAlso, my wife is an editor, and I'm working with ideas to incorporate
  what she does and market ourselves as a package. How do I handle work she is involved
  with currently since she is employed by an institution?\r\n"

  body: Most <strong>working</strong> people build their portfolios while working
    for someone, whether clients or a boss. As long as you (and your wife) actually
    <strong>did</strong> the work you are claiming to have done, there shouldn't be
    a problem. And, if you worked as a member of a team, be honest about that.

  body: "Thanks guys. I like Norberts take and specific wording. I have a tendency
    to get a bit too technical, which can make me seem a bit wobbly.\r\n\r\nOldnick.
    Not sure about your bold usage. Hope I've not done anything to make myself seem
    suspicious. I have never and would never misrepresent myself, although I can see
    from posts on Typophile that this is more common than I might suspect.\r\n\r\nHere's
    an example. My wife just finished editing a catalogue for an upcoming exhibition
    of the work of Anselm Kiefer. I'm not the designer on the project. If I show the
    book I'll be very clear about what's what. My question would be whether to show
    an image of the book or not?\r\n"
