    body: "Thanks! The only thing is that these books were printed in the 1960's and
      the font above says it's copyright is 1991. Any idea of something from the era?\r\n\r\nAny
      way, this is the closest yet. Much appreciated."

    form (for a specific publisher).\r\nIf you go to this page:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/ag-old-face-bq/\r\n\r\nyou
    can see this is a redraw of an older face:\r\n<blockquote>In 1984 H. Berthold
    released this redraw of Akzidenz-Grotesk by G\xFCnter Gerhard Lange.\r\nThis design
    emphasizes the 19th Century hand-setting roots of the original Akzidenz-Grotesk.\r\nDesigners:
