body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Designers]] : Torsten Weisheit</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
  German designer Torsten Weisheit created the font Linotype Irish Text\u2122 in 1997.
  Linotype Irish Text is part of the Take Type Library, chosen from contestants of
  [[Linotype]]\u2019s International Digital Type Design Contests of 1994 and 1997.
  Weisheit designed this font based on Irish scripts of the 5th century. Characteristic
  of this style is the mixture of upper case letters in the mostly lower case alphabet
  and vice versa. The letters look as though written with a broad tipped pen and have
  triangular serifs, displaying a decorative tendency akin to that of Irish [[calligraphy]].
  Linotype Irish Text is intended exclusivley for headlines in large point sizes.
