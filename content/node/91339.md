body: "I've always been wary of mixing oldstyle and lining figures, except in very
  specific ways. For example, a number associated with a software version might use
  lining figs while the software itself has initial caps.\r\n\r\nWe're revising the
  company business cards with the new logo, and I'd love to see oldstyle figs there.
  But they look a little busy in multiple lines of phone and fax numbers. But they
  look great in the address. Would it be crazy to use OsF in the address and not in
  the phone numbers?\r\n"

    numbers look better in one than the other)\r\n- typeface\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nHere
    is an example. Not business stationery, but it\u2019s apparent that there is a
    layout reason for using both:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/093d2d2e0b112W3b391w/SHIPS_page_5236.jpg\">\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In this case, the functional issue is that with descenders and ascenders,
    the line spacing of the phone numbers starts looking a bit cramped.\r\n\r\nMan,
    I don't know why I am sweating this call so much, but it is bugging me. At least
    the new company logo looks great (IMNSHO).\r\n\r\nWell, off to make a call now.
    Thanks, Charles and Nick!\r\n\r\nT"

    they don't have room to do that. But overall I think it's for the best.

    design, I chose to use three different figure styles on one page:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>OSF
    were used as default, throughout the text.</li>\r\n<li>I resorted to lining figures
    for the sizes, as the OSF looked bumpy with the fractions.</li>\r\n<li>The archive
    numbers consisted of caps and figures. That looked best in small caps, hence small
    caps figures.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<a href=\"http://kaune.hardwig.com/portfolio/dian-woodner-collection\"><img

  body: "Thomas, as Nick says, it depends, but as a generality, within the text of
    a book, we'll use old style generally, but with full caps, we'll use lining. It
    gets a little hincky when there is only one letter and it's a cap, like I-75 (for
    an interstate highway).  My feeling it is still better to use the lining with
    the full cap. Holds true even if the sentence is \"In 1975, I-95 was finished.\"
    Oldstyle for the date, lining for the interstate number. It's a matter of what
    gets a full cap & what doesn't -- just as with the alpha characters..\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: The novel 1Q84 by Murakami, designed by Chip Kidd, uses OSF for the year 1984
    and lining numbers for the fictional year 1Q84, which sometimes occur in the same
    sentence.

  body: "Maybe a rule of thumb is that OSF is potentially problematic when letters
    and numbers are part of the same word?  A few of the examples above fit this rule.
    \ The letters can interfere with interpreting OSF's as numbers.  Something I wrote
    had the gene name \"IBD5\" in a Adobe Garamond with OSF, and the 5 was hard to
    read as a 5.  To me, in that context the 5 looked a bit like a Greek final sigma.

    I'm talking about.)"

    kept the OSF.
