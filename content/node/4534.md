  logo</a> was done with? If I&#39;d know the agency who did the belgacom housestyle
  I&#39;d ask them, but I don&#39;t know that either. <BR>Thanks for any feedback

  body: Looks like a cross between a modified <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pump-2/pump-light/testdrive.html?s=belgacom&amp;p=72">Pump</a>
    and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bauhaus/medium/testdrive.html?s=belgacom&amp;p=72">ITC
    Bauhaus</a> - perhaps using alternate characters.

    the <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALET-FO&amp;sub=view" target="_blank">House
    Chalet</a> &#39;flavors&#39; too. Looks like the 1960 &amp; 1970 variations would
    provide these characters. '

  body: Found nothing relevant yet about who designed the logo. <BR>I&#39;ve got a
    back-up plan but this might take a couple of days. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.zdnet.be/News.cfm?id=21386&amp;mxp=40"
    target="_blank"> Here</a>&#39;s an article about the introduction of the new logo,  <BR>and

    here</a>&#39;s the usual PR-blabla on their own site.

  body: Thanks Yves. <BR> <BR>Its indeed custom designed with some of the flavours
    mentioned above. <BR>An acquaintance at <a href="http://www.bubble.be">bubble</a>
    told me it was designed by <a href="http://www.landor.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=cNews.news&amp;storyid=272&amp;g=1200&amp;n=1220&amp;year=2002">Landor</a>,
    from there I found <a href="http://users.ncrvnet.nl/mstol/belgacom.htm">this</a>
    excellent site on corporate identity by Hans Stol. <BR> <BR>I also found <a href="http://www.lineto.com/">Typ1451</a>
    from lineto as a &#39;stronger&#39; alternative. <BR> <BR>Thanks all of you for
    the feedback, <BR>G
