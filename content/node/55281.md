  body: "Hi David\r\n\r\nIMG_1034.jpg \u2013 for the 'Substance' headline I would
    have said <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=202543&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=30332&query=FALSTAFF&SCOPE=Fonts\">Monotype
    Falstaff</a> but the serif bracketing is slicker on the UCCA example.\r\n\r\nBTW
    are you any relation to John Marsh of Barnet, Hertfordshire? He is/was a graphics
    teacher up that way and an old friend of my dad's."

  body: SUBSTANCE could be <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_modern_no_216_std_heavy/&sample_text=SUBSTANCE&sample_size=60">ITC
    Modern No. 216</a>. See also <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/genres/didone_extra_bold/">Extra

  body: I would suggest <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/sahara-bodoni/overview.html">Sahara
    Bodoni</a> for SUBSTANCE. After careful consideration, I would say it is the best
    match of the fat didones i know of.
