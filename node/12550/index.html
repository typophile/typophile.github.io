The DVD Packaging of Sin City (8/16/05) features none other than a slanted Comic Sans! You'd think that with Frank Miller directing it and with its dark themes they could have at least used a real comic font. 

You can see the packaging <a href=http://www.dvdanswers.com/index.php?r=0&s=1&c=6614&n=1&burl= target=new>here</a>

It's a shame that so few professional designers read typophile. How else are they supposed to know that they are supposed to avoid Comic Sans? This DVD guy may have an excuse, but this ad...

		<div class="commentbody">Even worse: The DVD cover art for <em>American Splendor</em> (another movie that was based on comics) features not only a stretched-out Comic Sans MS, but CC JimLee, CC JoeMad, and at least two forms of Graphite as well. And that's just the "comic book" fonts.

I have no idea why. It's a disheartening mess.

I couldn't find an official online source for the full cover art, but if anyone wants to see it, it's available <a href=http://www.cdcovers.cc/dvd_a.php>here</a>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think they were probably trying to mimic the profusion of lettering styles found on the average comic book page. I've been doing some production work for a comic company recently, and really good contemporary digital letterers use a pretty dizzying array of typefaces, and then modify them heavily as needed (especially for sound effects). It's a totally different world than traditional typography or sign lettering. The problem with the American Splendor covers is that they get caught halfway between typography and comic lettering, and the results are pretty ungainly. They get a B for effort, though!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"> I dunno, as much as I wanna jump on the bandwagon, comic sans has its place. and if its place is on cover of a comic book movie DVD, given it's familiarity to the general public. this kind of strikes me as a 'new ups logo hate' because it isn't rand. Given a little while, from what I've gathered on typophile, the new UPS logo is appropriate and NEEDED. Comic Sans does look like comic lettering ...

		<div class="commentbody">I don't mind [[Comic Sans]] so much, but I still cannot stand the new UPS logo, or their use of FF Dax on their trucks. I kinda think a shipping service makes more sense being all conservative and frumpy. Conservative and frumpy means they're getting me my latest Amazon or Powell's fix on time, and I don't know what the hell their new identity is supposed to mean.

Comic Sans has no real relationship to "real" comic lettering, which is almost never as childlike and irregular as Comic Sans. I really don't think it's a terrible typeface (read the Typowiki entry, which I wrote), but it is misnamed.</div>

And 'Comic Sans' means 'without comic'.
