  font with Fontographer 5 but I didn't finish because I need some help.\r\n\r\nI
  need to know how I can create Open type standard ligatures feature with Fontographer
  5, font lab or Volt.\r\n\r\nor I need to know how I can create ligatures feature..
  when I type some letters together the glyph replaces.. for example AL-JALALAH WORD
  (ALLAH), in some fonts if you type LAM LAM HAA it will have specific shape.\r\n\r\nany
  tutorials, lessons or hints will be very helpful.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMohammed\r\nmohammed.faqier@gmail.com"

  body: "You have to create glyphs in fontlab and insert the Open Type tables (Unicode
    values, characters substitutions, ligatures, marks positioning etc.) through MS
    Volt. Fontlab is unable to handle all Arabic lookups. Microsoft has also provided
    a sample Arabic Naskh font (named as Arabic Typesetting font) with Volt project
    file. It contains almost all the required features and lookups needed for an Arabic
    font. If you open this font in Volt and look through this font features and lookups
    you can learn how to use ligatures. \r\n\r\nHere is the sequence\r\n\r\n1- create
    glyphs in Fontlab and generate a font file.\r\n2-open the font in Volt and insert
    OT features and lookups (or use the <strong>Import Project</strong> command if
    you already have a saved Volt project file to use it with this font file).\r\n3-use
    <strong>Ship Font</strong>  command in Volt to create the final font containing
    Open Type tables.\r\n\r\n<em>Note:</em> Be careful, before shipping font always
    use the <strong>Export Project</strong>  command to save the volt project as a
    separate file or you will lose all your volt work. Later you can use the <strong>Import
    Project</strong> command to open your work with any font file in Volt.\r\n\r\nAlong
    with Typophile forum you will also get a great help from [[http://forum.fontlab.com/microsoft-visual-opentype-layout-tool-%28volt%29/?PHPSESSID=54680a4dfe4b5fc0a4a8efd2849ec6a7|

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI mostly follow the same steps outlined by brother Zuhair.\r\n\r\nYou
    will first need to add \"Arabic\"language in VOLT (first pane towards left).\r\nThen
    add \"rlig\" features under Default item.\r\nNext, add  substitution lookup namely
    RLIG for \"Allah\" ligature (middle pane).\r\nOpen the lookup by double clicking
    it.\r\nSet \"Process Marks\" to NONE and choose RTL where it says LTR (far right)\r\nThen
    drag that lookup on the corresponding feature.\r\n\r\nSave, Compile, Export Project
    and Ship font (don't forget to save the font with different name eg. don't overwrite
    your original TTF or OTF file).\r\n\r\nBest of luck.\r\n\r\nMoiz."
