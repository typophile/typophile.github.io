  body: I don&#39;t think they should have aligned the D and the n -- it causes problems
    with the visual hierarchy. The eye follows the n down instead of reading the rest
    of the word. They should have focused on even spacing on the line in which &#34;Daily
    Care&#34; falls. It look heavy and poorly balanced. Too many people focus on the
    seemingly obvious alignments when there are far more important alignments to be
    watched. Kyle, I&#39;m not picking on you, I&#39;m just remembering some past
    things of which you reminded me. <BR> <BR>Just my two cents. It is a little late
    to critique, but you guys seems to have so much fun critiquing work that is finished.

    <BR>Tanya: perhaps <b>skill</b> has something to do with it. I doubt that you&#39;re
    impressed by all the stuff that <a href="http://www.landor.com/">these guys</a>
    do &#40;who aren&#39;t in-housers&#41;. <BR> <BR>While I appreciate the sentiment
    that some people have no respect or sensibility, I don&#39;t think that the test
    is whether you work inside the place or outside of it. Some of us struggle daily  trying
    to make the best of a bad thing left behind by people who weren&#39;t in house.
    And I am positive the opposite is the case as well. <BR> <BR>I am not impressed
    by this revision, in-house or not. Although I have no idea who did it, or what
    the design brief was &#40;assuming there was one&#41;, I don&#39;t like the result.
    The puffy letters look like a certain <a href="http://www.cheerios.com/about/honeynut.asp">cereal</a>,
    and kind of have a non-identifiable and indistinct harmless feel. At least the
    type in the original felt somehow reassuringly technical or clinically effective
    &#40;It appears to be Avant Garde...anyone?&#41;. <BR> <BR>I question whether
    making something kind of mundane and me-too is what you really want do do when
    competing in the personal care market. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: I&#39;d have to agree with Jon. Being Inhouse or an outside agency designer
    has nothing to do with the final design. Having been both I find all too often
    that the end result is based on the whims of a committee of bad taste with no
    knowledge of design much less typography.&#60;br&#62;&#60;br&#62; <BR>The best
    designer in the world could be hamstrung by an inept marketing department unwilling
    to relinquish the least bit of control to the those more qualified.

  body: Man, what is UP with Landor... do they have a copyright on gradients or what?  <BR>
    <BR> <BR>And Daniel is right... even as a freelancer your work is messed up by
    stubborn customers and awful design-by-committee processes. At least as a free
    designer you can walk away from such jobs, if your financial status allows for
    it.  <BR> <BR>At least they visually stressed the BAKING SODA CLEAN, which is
    one of the most absurd poieces of advertisement. It was less conspicious before,
    but now this new package basically communicates the idea of smearing a paste of
    sodium bicarbonate on your teeth... which makes me imagine a pulvery, smeary,
    badtasting dry, awful substance... not what I&#39;d like a customer to associate
    with my product at ALL... ugh :-&#41;.

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Jon, my remark was a big generalization,
    but from my point of view its often true.  <BR> <BR>The new breed designer that
    gets hired in-house for minimum wage is given a computer for &#34;tools&#34; and
    a copy of photoshop for dummies. Often enough they get reshuffled from the communications
    dept once some manager discovers that John Doe created that smashing powerpoint
    with rotating globes. I&#39;ve met plenty of them who now carry the title &#34;graphic
    designer&#34; on their biz card. <BR> <BR>However there are a few in-house designers,
    such as yourself I&#39;m sure that do have the education to back the position.  <BR>
    <BR>One has to admit that their numbers are dwindling in favor of those candidates
    who meet job requirements which include 30 different software programs for 20K
    a year. <BR> <BR>The corporation is lucky that you can fix things nicely but sadly
    uneducated about your job and design in general if they are hiring these outside
    agencies responsible for gradient crap. <BR> <BR>In all, Its just hard to beleive
    that any respectable design firm would allow gradient tricks and plug-ins out
    the door to any client, committee or not. And who does that leave? students, beginners,
    and the cost-saving in-housers. I&#39;m not trying to be elitist believe me, just
    pragmatic. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, I&#39;m starting to think that these larger
    design firms are hiring the same dime a dozen. Or perhaps there&#39;s some new
    school of thought that justifies gradients that no one knows about? <BR> <BR>See
    its just very scary to see! If more and more large co.&#39;s are getting 3-D&#39;ed
    then its gonna be very hard to explain to our next clients why its bad and why
    these large co.&#39;s are doing it wrong. <BR>-t <BR>&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: Tanya, I agree largely with what you say. Especially about the the smashing
    powerpoint. I have also just seen a job posting for a graphic designer for my
    city government cleverly disguised a clerical opening for a rate significantly
    smaller than what they pay me and requiring more technical knowledge in print
    and online work than I have with 7 years of experience. <BR> <BR>I DO undertand
    what you are witnessing. I just don&#39;t think that the inside/outside dichotomy
    is really the thing. <BR> <BR><i>Or perhaps there&#39;s some new school of thought
    that justifies gradients that no one knows about? </i> <BR> <BR>&#60;speculation&#62;
    Maybe a confluence of production technology with inadequate designers? I wonder
    if better techniques in printing, painting whatever, make things like gradients
    more doable and more tempting?&#60;/speculation&#62; <BR> <BR><i>I&#39;m not trying
    to be elitist believe me, just pragmatic.</i> <BR> <BR>I wonder if it&#39;s not
    more pragmatic to think that <b>any operation</b>&#40;inside or outside&#41; will
    hire cheaper if they know they can sell the work. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re
    being elitist. I just think that the inside/outside dichotomy is false. <BR> <BR><i>hard
    to explain to our next clients why its bad and why these large co.&#39;s are doing
    it wrong.</i> <BR> <BR>I know this is hard for those who really care about visual
    communication. But at least you know you&#39;re right and why so you can say it.

    THAT was the plan. <BR> <BR>&#60;imagine&#62;<i>&#34;...and the resized &#34;O&#34;
    implies the targeting of the customer&#39;s pain. The size difference is enough
    to have mental impact, but not enough to be noticed by the general public. The
    subconcious manipulation here shown will yield millions for stakeholders, shareholders
    and the comany&#39;s directorate...&#34;</i>&#60;/imagine&#62; <BR> <BR>&#60;imagine&#62;<i>...when
    I was drawing the logo I noticed that the o actually dipped below the bottom line
    of the other letters like the n, so I changed it to match...</i>&#60;/imagine&#62;
