		<div class="commentbody">What you need to do is use Kerning Assistance (in the Metrics menu). It lets you set up sets of equivalent left and right characters (glyphs) which are automatically updated as a group when you change the kerning for any one of them. It's a little tricky to figure out the meaning of the &quot;link&quot; option, but the manual has a pretty good explanation of how it works. <BR> <BR>Metrics Assistance is also handy for making sure all A's, for instance, have the same width and/or sidebearings whenever you change any one of them. <BR> <BR>An Aside: <BR> <BR>I have completely switched over to FontLab now and would never go back, but these are two features that were much better done in Fontographer, IMO, and I really miss them.  <BR> <BR>You can do a similar thing to FOG's Kerning Assistance in FontLab by setting up classes and using <i>its</i> Kerning Assistance. But you have to remember which is the key glyph in each class and kern only to that glyph. You also can't see the effects of the kerning on any other members of the class except in the Preview window. With FOG, it didn't matter which member of the equivalent set you kerned, the value would automatically be updated among all the members of the set. The main thing was that, once you set it up, you didn't have to remember, was it the D or the O that controls kerning of characters with round right sides?  <BR> <BR>FontLab's Metrics Assistance is a bit closer to FOG's, but still not as nice since it has to be applied manually and, again, is tied to a key glyph which you must keep track of.</div>

As I am learning this software I am begining to realise certain things very quickly, and from a couple of replys to my question have already realised some fatal flaws in my design process, at this point, all upper, lower, numerals and punctuation, all done manually might I add (and not using the kerning assistance as pointed out by another post on Typophile) if have managed to create round about 2500 pairs <BR> <BR> S</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I hope this doesn't sound like a dumb question, but 2500 is a very high number of kerning pairs: Did you work out your spacing using the sidebearings (i.e., the space on either side of each letter) before you started kerning? In other words, does your font look okay with the kerning turned off?  <BR> <BR>The reason I ask is that, with that many pairs just for A-Z and a-z, it sounds like you are trying to space the font using kerning instead of adjusting the sidebearings. I have seen beginners make this mistake before. If that's not the case, never mind.</div>
