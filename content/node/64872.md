body: "Hi,\r\nI've seen somewhere (I'm sorry to be so vague, but I really can't remember
  where) a letterhead that used an em dash \u2014 between every paragraph of the \"contact
  list\", like this:\r\n\r\nMy Name\r\nMy job\r\nWhat I do\r\n\u2014\r\nMy street\r\nMy
  zip code\r\nMy city\r\n\u2014\r\nEtc\r\nEtc\r\nEtc\r\n\r\nIs it a typographical
  habit? Or some original way to use the em dash?"

    dashes, single dashes, whatever you want, basically whatever is most pleasing
    to the eye for the specific application.
