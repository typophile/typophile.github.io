    you are indeed my favouritest Grotesque, although I wouldn't know if you're extended
    or not. Me I'm more on the condensed side."

  body: "Thanks Yves: I have never seen that typeface in my life and I do like it
    much. There was ad for Christopher Farr rugs in upscale interior design magazine
    and I have to say it looked pretty good in that setting. The FontFont site listed
    this font as PL Brazilia. Any idea what this means or who the designer(s) is?
    \ \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz\r\n\r\n\r\nPS......\r\n\r\n\"BTW Lari, you
    are indeed my favouritest Grotesque, although I wouldn\u2019t know if you\u2019re
    extended or not. Me I\u2019m more on the condensed side.\"\r\nGet a room guys.
