  recently completed my first year within the Graphic Design industry after graduating
  from Middlesex Uni.\r\n\r\nAs we know Graphic Design consists of various elements.
  One thing I have discovered during my uni days even more so during my post as a
  junior designer, I absolutely love working with typography. What I would desperately
  like to find out if there are specialist areas/industries/career paths where I can
  channel my passion of type, type and MORE type?\r\n\r\nI look foward to your advice
  and input!\r\n\r\nDeren"

    image-heavy or conceptual stuff. And of course, start designing type ;)

  body: Would a typesetting post predominantly involve mind-numbing forms and similar
    artworks or would there be space for experimentation/creativity?

  body: I suppose it depends on what numbs your mind; what you find creative. But
    by in large, no, you don't want to be a typesetter. You probably don't want to
    be designer on salary. To experiment, to be creative, start your own foundry or
    agency, and see if anyone is willing to pay for your fun.
