A union per se conjures up a bargaining position which would certainly be impractical.  Then there would be the certification fiasco to endure.  It just seems too far from reality.  Collusion on price fixing is not legal at least in the USA. What would a member get that would more than compensate for the dues?</div>

<p>Unions and some professional organizations are not bound by the same antitrust rules that businesses and individuals are. This is why, for example, the Graphic Artists Guild can do a survey of hourly rates for design services and publish it.</p>
<p>I can’t see how AIGA can even compare to a real union. For starters, how many unions not only demand membership dues but then also demand more money every time you want to show up at a meeting?</p>

<p>Unions are generally most effective in occupations where employers hire a large workforce of union members &ndash; places like factories, hospitals, schools, etc.  Employers know that if the union goes on strike they&rsquo;ll lose a large workforce that may be difficult to replace.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t many companies that have a huge staff of graphic designers. If a company has two graphic designers on staff, the threat of a strike won&rsquo;t mean much. If they go on strike they&rsquo;ll just be replaced.</p>
<p>Also unions generally specify wages, which may be easy to do in a factory where you&rsquo;re paid by the hour, or a school where you get a yearly salary, but many (perhaps most) designers are self-employed and price each job individually based on a variety of factors.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t see a union happening.</p>

<p>I agree fully with James that there isn&rsquo;t really any advantage to unionizing the font industry because we&rsquo;re all independent contractors as it were not unified under any single organization that we work for or service . . .</p>
