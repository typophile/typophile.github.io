  body: "Could be wrong but as I don't know any geometric sans with such a leg for
    /R, could be custom. I'm not even sure if /W is not customized as well. My choice
    would probably be [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avenir|Avenir]] (mainly because
    of x-width and bowl and /G crossbar upper position) customizing /W centre apex
    (or overlapping 2 /Vs and chopping off crossing stem part) and adding a custom
    leg to /P. More candidates to customization: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova|Proxima

  body: "Mixing Parisine and Parisine Plus you could approximate the look, but |G|
    isn't wider enough.\r\nPluto, on the other hand, is too wide overall (once you
    cut the inner \"branch\" of |W|).\r\nThere are others sans with unconventional
    legs on |R|, but of those I saw none has the same of the sample, and all have
    wrong details for other letters (examples: Filson, Fox Grotesque, Cabrito Sans).
    I found especially difficult finding a matching |W|."
