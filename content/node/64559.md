body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if fellow Typophiles could recommend a typeface
  that would go with the image below and keywords like: culture & cross-cultural,
  diversity, education, social, playful, universal. I'd like it to be rather bold,
  mainly for display purposes - titles, headings and shorter texts but a body text
  weight for longer descriptions would be nice too.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/forum-logo_6512.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\n________\r\nAleksander\r\nwww.culturepicture.com"
