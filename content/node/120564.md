  HOME-COTE font on this old paint tin? Lovely rounded capital E and a beautiful H
  and C. Will probably have to modify something, but can anyone suggest something
  half way there?\r\n\r\nAlso Enamel font - I guess I could use the C of something
  and add a cross bar....\r\n\r\nThanks !\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/10_07_10_Paint8_5155.jpg]"
