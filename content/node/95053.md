    originality: I have to agree with Nick, including about wasting time (something
    I consider our most valuable resource - I tend to even get religious about it).
    And I would offer the following \"antidote\" to the Warde-ian \"transparency\"
    business: just because a layman can't spontaneously see differences in fonts doesn't
    make them the same. Or: <em>Nothing</em> is really transparent to the human unconscious.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>/u/

  body: 'Andreas, it''s impossible for me to evaluate a text font without looking
    at it on paper in a multi-page document. Looking at a snippet, enlarged, on a
    screen just doesn''t do it. But... Holy Hannah, this is one dark font! That''s
    the kind I like. And it reads very well, as far as I can tell from the screen
    snippet. The ascenders/descenders look fine to me. The "fi" in "figure" looks
    good enough for me to say: no ligature needed. I realize it''s a work in progress,
    but to my eye the spacing of "Pe" in the first word and "pp" in appeals looks
    a shade too wide. My big picture opinion: This might be one of the dark, twenty-first
    century book text faces we''ve been waiting for.'

    on the printed page of a book.\r\nHowever, my thoughts guiding me towards that
    attempt have been of another sort.\r\nI would never be so bold to claim that anyone
    may be waiting for this. (who on earth did ever WAIT for a PARTICULAR face to
    come?!!)\r\nNo. \r\nBut if there would be something sensible in the design, I\u2019d

  body: "<blockquote>who on earth did ever WAIT for a PARTICULAR face to come?!!</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell,
    I believe that to <em>ideally</em> typeset any given job, the font does not exist;
    what people do is compromise and [hopefully / try to] choose the <em>one</em>
    font that does exist and does the job better than any other. So to me it makes
    total sense for somebody to exclaim \"Eureka!\" when he sees a particular font
    (and this could be a font that was just released, or even under development).\r\n\r\nAnd
    this isn't just hypothetical: when Emily Artinian started looking for Latin and
    Armenian fonts to set \"From Ararat to Angeltown\"* she became stuck. When she
    bought Nour&Patria she said it was the only typeface that could do what she needed.\r\n\r\n*
