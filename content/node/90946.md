  & Sons were never digitized.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody here have anymore info about these
  fonts?  Does anyone know if the actual woodblock themselves are still around?  I
  am particularly interested in the \"Regent\" font that spells out the word \"GARDENS\"
  in this specimen from 1906.\r\n\r\nIf there is nothing else available, what is your
  opinion of the possibility on creating a complete uppercase alphabet and numerals
  from this one specimen?  Also, is there any information available on how one might
  do this?  I've been looking for some writing about doing such things for awhile
  now.  Call it, \"how to make a complete font set from one letter\" or something
  like that.  Obviously this type has been done before, such as when old fonts are
  updated with characters they didn't originally contain.\r\n\r\nhttp://maelhorn.com/xtra/harrild_woodcut_fonts.png\r\n\r\n(note
  to webmaster, the insert image function and the attachment function are not working.
  \"onHTTPError: 500\" and \"An HTTP error 0 occurred. /upload/js\" respectively.)"

  body: "Actual printing blocks may still be extant; however, finding them can be
    problematic.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, it's possible to create a complete character from
    a small number of visual cues. For example, this typeface was developed solely
    from the letters \"Riquet\"\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/picayune-intelligence-bt/roman/\r\n\r\nIf
    you can detect a pattern, you can extrapolate; however, such detection and extrapolation
    are not skills which can be easily taught."

    get on with it.\r\nThe problem is clearly defined in the design precept of Regent."

  body: "Like Nick says, much of the information you need is contained in the sample.
    \r\n\r\nEach letter in GARDENS provides directions for handling that class of
    letters: \r\n\r\n- G for round letters like C and O\r\n- R for letters like P
    and B\r\n- N for its siblings/cousins M and Z\r\n\r\n...etc.\r\n\r\nFind other
    types from the period, or in the same style, or from the same foundry, to absorb
    the zeitgeist that informed the design decisions."

  body: Yeah I think the numerals will be the hardest.  There's really no place to
    put that interesting "plus sign serif" I'll call it, that appears in the lower
    lefthand corner of the letters.  Except for "5," I could see it working there.

  body: Yeah the S is a good model for 5, but what about 9? or 8?  I cant see the
    plus sign working there at all.  What do you all think?

    the visible part of a letter put into the ground, like the little boards where
    you write the name of the plants in a garden. \r\nAnd seriously you don\u2019t
    see the relationship between S and 8?\r\nBy the way, I think numerals would be
    the last of your worries (and, more often than not, this kind of typeface didn\u2019t
    even had numerals)."

  body: Well, whatever they are, its definitely what draws me to the design.  I have
    never seen anything like it before.  Take them away and its basically just a Tuscan.
