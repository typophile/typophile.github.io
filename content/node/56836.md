    in Word 2007, there is same problem in that font.\r\nBut I have made the font
    with FontLab & put the OpenType Tables with VOLT and there I have not applied
    Kashida in any combination in any Lookup.\r\nSo why the wrong Kashida appears
    after some Ligatures & do not appear after other ligatures.\r\nIn Adobe Arabic
    font this problem also appears but only after some of these ligatures not after
    all of these.\r\nIn Traditional Arabic there is no problem but it has very few
    Ligatures, almost all words has only four shapes i.e. initial, medial, final &
    isolated.\r\nI have observed that the wrong kashida appears only after the end
    of these ligatures\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/After words wrong Kashida_3500.jpg]\r\nWhile
    the wrong kashida appears in the centre of only one word that is \"meeminitial
    meemaleffinal\" as shown below\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Iside words

  body: "It appears that the problem is in Microsoft VOLT because when I used the
    FontLab to make Ligature subtitutions the problem disappeared and the Kashida
    appeared at correct places in Word 2007 as shown by the image below.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font
    created with FontLab_3961.jpg]\r\nKeep in mind that this problem do not accur
    in Normal Justification. Instead it appears only in Low, Medium & High Justification
    and in all those Fonts which have large Number of Ligatures i.e Adobe Arabic,
    Microsoft Arabic TypeSetting Font etc.\r\nWhen I used the Microsoft VOLT to create
    the same font the problem appeared as shown in the 2nd image given below.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Font
    created with VOLT_6106.jpg]\r\nBut I am bound to VOLT because I do not know how
    to use LookUps, Anchor attachment for Marks and Accurate Kerning in FontLab. In
    this respect FontLab is very difficult while the Volt is much easier.\r\nIs there
    any solution Typophiles ?\r\nI think to Inform the Volt Developing Team. But I
    do not know about them. How Should I inform them?\r\nPlease Help me ..............\r\nThanks"

  body: "Eben, Word 2007 supports all the layout features necessary for Arabic shaping.
    It doesn't support purely discretionary features such as [dlig], but it supports
    all the required features and also those features such as [liga] and [calt] that
    should be on by default. The Uniscribe Arabic shaping engine takes care of all
    this.\r\n\r\nWhat Zuhair's screenshots indicate is a problem between certain states
    of the Word Arabic justification algorithm and some fonts. The fact that there
    seems to be a difference in behaviour between fonts with OTL tables generated
    by VOLT and those generated by FL/FDK certainly is intriguing."

    If font forms a ligature consisting of letters on both sides of expected justification
    point, Uniscribe will ask kashida to be inserted after the ligature. \r\n\r\nTher
    is no problem in VOLT, difference in behavior should be caused by different layout
    tables produced by VOLT and AFDK.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"

    & not in VOLT.\r\nBut one thing is still confusing that why this problem do not
    occur in the Font at same Ligatures created by Fontlab as shown by my last 2 images.
    Why Word 2007 differentiate between the two fonts, one by FontLab & the other
    by VOLT.\r\n\r\nAlso I want another question. I downloaded the \"save as PDF\"
    add-on for Word 2007 but when I try to create a PDF. Some ligatures do not appear
    in PDF correctly. Then I tried with the Adobe Arabic Font, the same problem occured
    there.\r\nIs there something wrong? "

    in MS Word 2010. There are four levels of justifications in MS Word 2010.\r\n1-Justify\r\n2-Justify
    Low\r\n3-Justify Medium\r\n4-Justify High\r\nIn the first level no kashida is
    inserted, only the inter-word spacing is increased. This works fine with all the
    fonts. While the other three levels of justification destroy most of the text
    shape in Calligraphic Fonts. These levels work only with linear fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks,"
