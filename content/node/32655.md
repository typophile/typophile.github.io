  French, German and Japanese columns across the page.\r\n\r\nThis thread http://typophile.com/node/12477
  that Chris started last year was very helpful and I now have all the Japanese copy
  inserted correctly into the InDesign document, nicely set in Hiragino Mincho Pro.\r\n\r\nMy
  question is this (and it may be more a question about Japanese than about Japanese
  type): I get the feeling that line breaks occur both in the middle of some compound
  kanji and also in the middle of some strings of kana (especially verb endings);
  is this acceptable for Japanese readers? Or are kanji compounds never supposed to
  break across lines? (And, if so, is there a helpful setting somewhere in InDesign
  to say \"don't break compound kanji across lines\"?)\r\n\r\nI've attached a pic
  from the InDesign file as an example. The example is from the instructions to a
  modern music score, and comprises two paragraphs. The break from the third to the
  fourth lines (in the first paragraph) breaks the verb ending \"teiru\" into \"te-iru\".
  Likewise, I think that the break between the second and third lines (in the second
  paragraph) may split a two-character kanji compound onto separate lines.\r\n\r\nAre
  line breaks like this problemmatic for native Japanese readers?"

  body: "I may have answered the questions above with some more googling. The FAQ
    http://www.opticentre.net/FAQ/Languages/Japanese-line-breaks/ makes it look like
    line-breaking is, in fact, a concern, as I was guessing above.\r\n\r\nFortunately,
    however, the PDF www.techart.com/downloads/ID&WL-Part2.pdf here written by Diane
    Burns points to a magic InDesign template available here http://www.techart.com/downloads/,
    which downloaded and loaded into InDesign quite easily.\r\n\r\nApplying Diane's
    j-bodytext paragraph style to my Japanese text produces the output given in the
    attachment. This new output looks great to my eyes because I don't see much (or
    any) split strings of kana or split strings of kanji.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not a native
    speaker. I would love it if somebody could confirm that the new text flow with
    Diane's paragraph style will satisfy a native speaker.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fixed-flow_3772.png]"
