  website (if it is a Google web font). Any recommendations? \r\n\r\nBit of background
  to the project is that it is for a fitness brand, which has lower case Chalet 1970
  in it's logo. "

  body: "Thanks for the reply. Is a lovely font, however I was looking for a san serif
    font. Should have put that in my first post! I am definitely looking for something
    with high readability though. \r\n\r\nI feel that a typeface where there isn't
    a top hook (sorry for the lack of correct terminology!) on the letter a. I believe
    that would go well with the circular and geometric feel of Chalet. "

    the first). The problem is fonts with such an \"a\" are rarely suitable for long
    text.\r\n\r\nWhat about going in another direction in terms of geometry?\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/cube\r\n\r\nOr
    there's this:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/sweet/sweet_sans_package_1_ot/\r\nAlthough
