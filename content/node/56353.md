body: "I'm working on a collection of dingbats specifically for a font that I created.
  It will include directional devices - arrows and pointing hands. Should I create
  a cell for each direction (left, right, up, down) for each symbol? Or, is one sufficient
  and the user can point them wherever they want to? I've noticed in other symbol
  fonts that there were redundant pointers for each direction. \r\n\r\nOn the other
  hand, maybe dingbat fonts are redundant?\r\n\r\nOpinions? Comments? Rude gestures?

  body: There are in fact Unicode points for diagonal arrows; bent and double headed
    ones too, but those may be in the math or misc. technical symbols ranges. The
    symbols of Zapf Dingbats and most of Wingdings are encoded too.
