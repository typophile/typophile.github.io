body: Is there a website somewhere that lists all the fonts used for a particular
  newspapers, such as the Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle, etc, etc, and categorizes
  the use of the fonts, such as &#34;Headline - font1, font2&#34;, &#34;Body - font3,
  font4&#34;.  Just getting into this.  I&#39;m a font lover, so your help is appreciated!!

    provides PDFs of hundreds of papers &#40;somewhat different mix each day&#41;,
    and you can go into &#34;Document_Properties/Fonts...&#34; in Acrobat and see!

  body: The only problem is that it only gives you a LIST of fonts in the document.  You
    really have no idea which one is which, and where each is used, unless you&#39;re
    keen enough to know.

  body: Also, are these pdf files created from the ACTUAL layout program the editor
    uses?  I wonder how they get these pdf files from the newspapers, if so. Hmmm...

    If the paper does not get to newseum, they are not listed. &#40;as you can see&#41;.
    It does not violate EULAs/copywrite laws because they are only exhibited as the
    front page for one day. &#40;However they do keep them on file for historical
    purposes, two days online, but not linked&#41; <BR> <BR>This is second-hand knowledge
    from speaking with Newseum&#39;s director at a SPJ meeting. <BR> <BR>EDIT reEULA:
    Most are &#34;secured pdfs,&#34; which in most cases prevents printing, editing,
    font extraction... etc. Not all are protected however. and Hrant&#39;s question
    is one I do not know the answer to... I hate legal wording <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    right click on it, I just get commenting options, nothing about what the font
    name is.

    TouchUp Text tool, which can be found on the Advanced Editing toolbar, to select
    some text. Then you&#39;ll find a &#34;Properties&#34; option in the context menu.

    were mostly unprotected, while those from the day before were nearly all protected.'

  body: EULAs can say whatever the font vendor wants them to. So sure, there are &#42;some&#42;
    EULAs that don&#39;t allow embedding at all &#40;though these seem to be a real
    minority&#41;. There are more that don&#39;t allow embedding for &#34;commercial&#34;
    use, where the PDF itself is sold -- see the Agfa Monotype EULA for an example
    of that, and their definition of commercial use. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T
