<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Here's an interesting webpage with some really scary info about the HD Copy Protection schemes used in Windows Vista.
<a href=http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/%7Epgut001/pubs/vista_cost.html>A Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection</a>
This isn't the first page to denounce the apparently merciless lockdown that Microsoft proposes. I personally think that it is a bunch of crap, and I'll be damned if I'll ever concede the point.
DRM is bad for consumers. DRM is bad for content producers. DRM is only good for content sellers and their cronies.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I'm not too worried about it. Apps can will still be able to circumvent it, Hollywood doesn't want anything to do with Microsoft, and the record companies are discussing dumping DRM entirely. Both of the next-gen DVD formats are already cracked, so that DRM system will be rendered an irrelevant waste. What the Vista DRM is going to do is prove that, even with some of the most qualified experts in the field and a bottomless pit of development funds behind it, DRM is still just a snake oil scam designed to sucker foolish executives into providing a new revenue stream to the scamsters.
Of course, I've used Windows for about two hours total in the last three months, and I'm considering ditching my remaining PC entirely, so hopefully it's a moot point for me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The DVD formats are cracked. But I'm willing to bet that the people who are going to use the cracks are the people who already download illegal content. The only people who are going to get hurt are those end users with consciences, i.e., those who actually purchased everything with cash money. (Not that anyone has been able to play ANY HD content via their newfangled DVD drives anyway...)
As to ditching a PC, that's all well and good, but the longer time goes on the closer the two main OSes and their hardware become. A Mac is now a glorified PC with a nicer form factor and a better OS, but the video cards, etc. relevant to the MS DRM scheme are practically identical. And a lot of these MS changes are going to be forced onto the hardware.</div>

You're forgetting about pain of the movie industry's big backers. They're paying a fee for every movie that goes out with some worthless DRM scheme, only to be cracked and dumped online or counterfeited relentlessly by organized crime syndicates. Eventually the people behind all those dollars are going to look at the books, realize how many billions of dollars were flushed down the big DRM toilet, and wince in pain. It's important that they feel that hurt, because its whats going to sour them on DRM and finally kill it for good.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I love that idea. Unfortunately, the DRM being implemented is at the very core of an entire operating system that will be distributed to millions of unknowing lemers before they know what's coming. It's gonna die, but it will be a long, painful death.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Y'know, I read all these threads about DRM and Letterhead's method, and I keep remembering what happened when the U.S. declared Prohibition.
Didn't work then, won't work now.
(Although a lot of Canadian companies -- hello Seagrams! -- did a booming business in rum-running.)

<div class=commentbody>What always startles me is the MS even needs to bow to these industries. They <em>own</em> home computing. I'm suprised that they gave in as fully as they did, when they probably could've shrugged it all off and forced the hands of the content providers. Particularly now that Apple is pushing so much content through a far less restrive DRMed pipeline on their own OS and store.
The hardware DRM really angers me, as it's completely disconnected from reality.</div>

<div class=commentbody>From my understanding, Vista's DRM issues apply only to HD-DVD and Blu-Ray content, and only if the content has special flags.
I read that essay by the NZ security researcher, too. I also read <a href=http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/01/20/windows-vista-content-protection-twenty-questions-and-answers.aspx>this response</a> from someone as Microsoft.
If you're still concerned after reading that, read this; an <a href=http://www.slyck.com/story1390.html>interview with the guy who first shared his AACS crack with the public.</a>

<div class=commentbody>I'm not concerned about the content itself. I honestly don't even buy DVDs now, so I severely doubt that I'll be buying Blue Ray or HDdvds (I don't download them either. If I want a movie, I'll rent it.)
Now, as a photographer, I'd love to BURN to these formats for backup, but that's another aspect...)

Microsoft doesn't need to bow to these industries, Microsoft is part of that industry; it's a member of the HD-DVD group. Microsoft also stands to profit from DRM, for years Microsoft has been trying to lure Hollywood to adopt camera-to-projector Windows Media solutions for digital film production. Hollywood isn't biting, but Microsoft won't stop trying.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You know, the one thing funny about this is people's argument:
"Microsoft is a huge company with more power than they know what to do with. Why should they bow to the Movie Industry?! They should just say how things are gonna go and make Hollywood go suck an egg."
I love how monopolies are bad when they're used <cite>against</cite> you, but good when used <cite>for</cite> you.
Maybe Microsoft has learned it's lessons about monopolies?

<div class=commentbody>As computer nerds and graphic designers we tend to have large monitors. I was originally going to ask if there is a possibility of this affecting graphic designers at all. Aside from the monitor issues, it just comes down to a discussion of what rights end users have to their own hardware, etc.
Imagine InDesign shutting down on you if say... Berthold decided that your hardware didn't match their requirements for using their fonts.
That would seriously suck.</div>
