  a perfect match with it. Any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greenwave_6394.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ray Larabie did his own take on the Trajan lettering and called it [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/byington/|Byington]].
    I think this might be Byington that has been widened. (Or it may be Trajan Bold
    that has been either widened or flattened.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Looking at the two typefaces, I am inclined to think the serifs on your sample
    look more like Trajan. Larabie says he beefed them up in his version, for video
    and lo-res applications, and I think that may be the difference.\r\n\r\n- Mike
