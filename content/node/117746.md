    close match:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/victorian/\r\n\r\nI have
    a PDF of the MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan Co. (Philadelphia) Compact Book of Specimens
    from 1892--I'm willing to bet I'll find the font in there. Unfortunately, the
    PDF is not indexed, so I'll have to skim through the pages. \r\n\r\nI'll keep
    you posted."

  body: "No luck with the type specimen book. If you have any idea of when the logo
    was first introduced/used, that might help narrow the search.\r\n\r\nThe more
    I look at it, the more I wonder if it is one of those 1970s attempts at creating
    a \"vintage\" font...."

  body: "Odd logo for a bank. I have no idea whether the letters are circa 1900 or
    1970s Disco Gothic with mini-serifs. It seems to say put your money with our awkward
    letters and our swirly girly _g_ will give it a spin.  The bulging bowl _B_ and
    open loop _k_ are blackletter ideas that became popular with Morris Troy http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/morris/
    and http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/morris/ The _B_ and _k_, as well
    as the _g_ have some resemblance to ITC Victorian -- already suggested by Kevin.
    A similarly curly _g_  is also found in David Quay's Lambada http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/lambada/
    and Azelea Rodgers' Azelea http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/arc/azelea/. The stroke
    terminations on _a_ and _b_ are very blackletter. See for example Weiss Rundgotisch
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/weiss-rundgotisch/ or http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/weiss-rundgotisch/\r\nAdd
    a few more touches like the spur on the vertical stroke of _f_  and the tendril
    with hanging ball in the middle of _B_ and you have a classic Frankenfont design.
    I would bank elsewhere.\r\nDon"

    with them. I suspect no thought whatsoever went into choosing it. I've yet to
    see how well my comments were received. :/\r\n\r\nThanks to both of you for your
    input."
