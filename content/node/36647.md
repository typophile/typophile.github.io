body: "Hi all, \r\nI've recently taken on a web job for a client but they wanted a
  quick modification of their existing logo, which is the stacked letter emblem.  Originally
  it was used rotated -90 degrees with the stem of the R functioning as a page break
  (yikes) for whatever it was used on.  The client wants to keep this emblem, but
  make it a bit more professional and iconic.  I added the additional text.  Let me
  know what you think: kerning, the whole square thing, etc.  I'm not introducing
  color just yet, just want to get it looking good in black for now, and trying to
  be fast and effective on this one.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BRMC-concepts_6682.gif]\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n-David"

  body: "I'm never a big fan of letterspacing to get the sentences equal in length.
    I think I would change the size to make it equal, or just let it flush.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    at the moment it's not really equal optically, if you wanted that. The 'McCullough'
    stands out. Let the period after Bridgette align more or less with the right stem
    of the 'H', and the middle stem of the 'Y' in 'advisory' more or less as well.
    This would make it look more aligned, in my opinion. :)"
