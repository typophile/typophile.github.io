  posts on a few threads that give credit to one or two or some, but not all.\r\n\r\nShouldn't
  there be an <strong>About</strong> link up top to go along with the <strong>Forums
  Projects Resources Typowiki News Membership</strong> links that would include history,
  locations, and who are the administrators, moderators, and volunteers?\r\n\r\nBTW,
  the \"Forums Projects Resources Typowiki News Membership\" links in IE 5.5 (<em>within
  a forum</em>, but not on the home page) are clickable links that I can open in a
  new window. In Firefox, those links are <em>always</em > part of Flash, on the home
  page as well as forum and thread pages, which cannot be opened in new Tabs or Windows
  as I would like.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Clickable_6472.jpg]"

    http://typophile.com/node/34616 . I think most of the committed (and not so committed)
    type designing Typophiles were mentioned.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Also here: [[Typophile
    Type Designers]]"

  body: The initial query was about those who contribute to the nuts-and-bolts of
    Typophile.com, not who designs type or otherwise contributes by virtue of their
    kind answers and expertise.
