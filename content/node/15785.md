  recommended fonts for headlines/subheads. We have to use Rotis Semi Sans for the
  body copy (corporate style and all) but what we use for headings is open. The design/content
  of the magazine is fairly straight and serious, but we're looking to make it a little
  cleaner, sharper and more contemporary while still maintaining its professional
  (somewhat straightlaced) positioning.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

    Its not a text face. '

  body: Unfortunately that's not really an option...Rotis Semi Sans is pretty much
    a dictate. All of our publications use Rotis Semi Sans for text and it can't be
    changed.

    i just used it in a project and the font that i have has really funky spacing

    anyone had a similar experience with Rotis?\r\n\r\n------\r\nnc"

  body: "> <em>What goes with Rotis?</em>\r\n&#160; &#160; --Answer: Potatoes.\r\n\r\nSorry,
    just a little Aicher humour. Many of Otl Aicher's design theories were cooked
    up in the kitchen, as presented in his book \xBBdie k\xFCche zum kochen\xAB (<em>The
    Kitchen's for Cooking</em>), and <em>rotis</em> was derived from his town Rotis/Allg\xE4u
    and for both \"cooking\" ideas and food.\r\n\r\nSince Rotis Semisans is <strong>mandated</strong>
    by your corporate style guide, I strongly suggest that you follow the styles presented
    in the corporate literature of <a href=\"http://www.erco.com/en_index.htm?http://www.erco.com/download/en/en_index_download.htm\"
    target=\"new\"><strong>ERCO</strong> <em>the light factory</em>.\r\n\r\nThe <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/product/172715/?mode=alpha\" target=\"new\">Rotis
    type family</a> was developed much from Aicher's own theories on typography and
    readability, and as such, works better in concept than in practical application.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason why you should closely review the usage of Rotis by ERCO is because Klaus-J\xFCrgen
    Maack, the founder also ran the famous family printing firm Druckhaus Maack. It
    was through the strong relationship of Aicher and Maack that Rotis became possible,
    thus ERCO adapted it as the corporate typeface.\r\n\r\nI would say that ERCO made
    great efforts in adapting the type family for literature as well as titling on
    their web site. You might as well benefit from one of the best usage of Rotis
    I have seen, and mind you, that is no easy task.\r\n\r\nERCO product and corporate

  body: "BTW Andre -- I think JY D\xE9cennie may work very well for titles with Rotis
    Semisans as text. It looks far more delicate in design when compared to Rotis
    Serif and just might take the \"edge\" off a very corporate look for the magazine."

    to play with. I'm intrigued by JY D\xE9cennie, not just because of its look but
    because it's \"based on Australian and New Zealand wood type\" and I work for
    a decidedly Australian organisation (nice fit!)."

      We chose to use it as our corporate font at SANE Australia for absolutely everything
      except web - it's an exceptionally good modern font.

    try Bodoni or Didot in headlines if they fit your corporate image. Mentioned Din
    (check FF Din Condensed family) and Trade Gothic would be nice too. \r\nAnyway,
    Rotis is not hardcore magazine typeface, it suits better for brochures or customer
    magazines. "
