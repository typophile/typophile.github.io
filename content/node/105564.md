  body: "O.K. this is what I have found. The images are from the CD cover for Spandau
    Ballet's album, Journey's to Glory, released in 1981 on the Chrysalis label, with
    the cover printed in West Germany. \r\nThe lettering also appears on Spandau Ballet's
    \"The Freeze.\"\r\nSo whoever created the CD cover probably also created the lettering.
    Photo-lettering could have ensured consistency. I suspect this was not a full
    font.\r\nDon"

    image.]\r\nI checked the usual places for faux-Cyrillic, free & pay, & drew a
    blank.\r\nThe base font is a high contrast serifed angular type in the general
    style of Eden, designed by R.H. Middleton in 1934.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eden_6668.jpg]\r\nSince
    writing this I found that the Spandau Ballet Logo was discussed four years ago.
    The typophiles of the day also suggested Eden as a possible source. http://typophile.com/node/60957\r\nDon"
