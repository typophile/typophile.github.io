  proud to announce the launch of our new type foundry [[http://www.typegroup.ie|TypeGroup]].
  Our first two releases are the ever-so-friendly sans-serif family [[http://www.typegroup.ie/fonts/orga|Orga]]
  and the chunky black slab [[http://www.typegroup.ie/fonts/kettle|Kettle]].\r\n\r\nAs
  well as designing and developing typefaces for sale, we\u2019re seeking opportunities
  for collaboration on type-based projects.\r\n\r\nWe love to talk about type so don\u2019t
  be shy! Get in touch at hello@typegroup.ie\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter [[http://twitter.com/typgrp|@typgrp]]"
