  logo requires the use of an ampersand. I thought I would post a topic here to see
  if anyone could give me any suggestions of Serif fonts that in your opinion have
  nice ampersands. Thanks"

    540 Italic</a> has a crazy swirly ampersand. I've used it as a stand-alone graphic
    element. Very decorative.\r\n\r\nBut maybe you're looking for something more \"cool\"/\"clean\"?
    It'd be helpful if you could define more precisely what you're looking for, as
    there are literally tons of \"nice ampersands\" out there."

  body: "Sorry for the vagueness... I shouldn't have used the word 'nice'. I guess
    I was looking for a bit of a brainstorm to identify a variety of Serif ampersands...
    For example 'Goudy' has quite a distinctive and interesting looking ampersand,
    with a broken hoop at the top.\r\n\r\nPossibly to narrow any suggestions... I
    think something more reserved rather than decorative is what i'm looking for."
