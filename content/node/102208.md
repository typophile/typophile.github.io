  figures in InDesign and Illustrator for example. I need to do a few tables and the
  \"Tabular linings\" options in InDesign and Illustrator does nothing. The numbers
  still aren't lined up properly. The font I'm using is Gotham (Thin, Book, Medium
  and Bold). The HF&J site said that those weight supports tabular figures. I've installed
  the OpenType version.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
