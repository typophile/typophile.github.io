body: "Hello typophilers, \r\n\r\nit's been a long time since my last post\r\nand
  i missed being around the block.\r\n\r\nSo, here I come up with a series of posters
  \r\nI did for a small exhibition of unpublished \r\nworks of mine created during
  the last \r\n5 years.If your way happento cross \r\nThessaloniki you could contact
  with me \r\nto visit the exhibition. It will be open \r\nuntill midof November (maybe
  it will \r\nlast even more).\r\n\r\nAbout the posters, I used two layers: \r\na
  constant one with the information \r\nin handmade lettering \r\nand the background
  layer \r\nwhich is changing, taking different \r\nphotos I shot around the city
  or \r\nin friends' houses.  \r\n\r\nThe posters are not trying to describe \r\nthe
  exhibition. They are a theme \r\nby themselves, though, inevitably \r\nthey give
  a hint of my graphic style, \r\nwhich is what you are going to watch \r\nin the
  exhibition. \r\n\r\nBy the posters I wanted to address \r\nto people who live in
  the same (urban) \r\nenvironment as me. The photos present \r\nthis environment,
  which at this point \r\nis filtered by my eyes. So, actually \r\nI state my existence
  in this place \r\nwe share. \r\n\r\nchristos\r\n\r\n"

    getting an exhibition on your work! We don''t really have graphic design exhibitions
    round these parts. '

  body: "Kris, I am astonished by your work in typography! \r\nEspecially by the notebooks;
    i think it is a beutifull \r\nidea to put your roughs in the site. My favourites
    are \r\nKarv Sans, Slabb and Eliza (with its \"Dorothy\" variation), \r\nbut I
    really miss a PDF with all characters. \r\nDo you plan to upload one in the future?
    \r\n\r\nCongratulations and please tell me what \"kia ora\" means? \r\nIs it a
    maory phrase?\r\n\r\n\u2015christos"
