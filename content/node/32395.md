  body: not sure about the script on the bread packaging but <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&startrow=1&records=&currpage=1&totalrecords=3&displayfontid=LP.100007.0.0&fontRendererText=Fun+%26+Energetic">Wendy</a>
    and <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=7&subpage=viewfonts">League
    Night</a> are a couple good script choices.

      should I stick to Chlorine that i have used on my magazine advert on the above

    alternate layouts you're working on?

    body: Ken, unfortunately not but I thought the green, florescent PLAY button would
      stand out on black. It would attract the target audience too (age 16-24 yr olds).
      It also depicts the idea of a night out i.e. disco lights in a club in the dark
      etc.

      I also can't afford to buy fonts at this stage so I have to stick with websites
      such as www.dafont.com unfortunately. Do you think that the nearest to the type
      on the fruit loaf packaging is:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/thickhead.font?text=PLAY+ON%21+where+ever+you+are\r\nOR\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/search.php?text=PLAY+ON%21+where+ever+you+are&psize=m&q=heart+breaker\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: giggles - I think you'll find that a post on the dafont forums will yield
    better results if you're only looking for free stuff. The members here are more
    familiar with commercial libraries.

    you're looking for freeware stuff. Some of our identifiers might be -- maybe justly
