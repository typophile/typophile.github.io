  exact type face for this. The closest I've been able to come is ITC Garamond Book
  Italic. That's what 'whatthefont' says it is. But I know for sure when looking at
  certain letters that it is not this. Could anyone figure this out? I have been wanting
  to know FOREVER!!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n"

  body: "It does look like ITC Garamond Book Italic.  Two differences: the ascenders
    in the \"l\" and \"h\" are a little higher in your logo, and your logo is a touch
    heavier. The heaviness could have been achieved by a photostat with a shorter
    exposure. The higher ascenders may be a feature of the pre-digital version or
    a custom tweak.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_garamond_book_italic/?&sample_text=Health%20System&sample_size=60&acs_pt=32&update=0\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/health_5835.jpg]"

  body: "Gosh I'm old...\r\n\r\nA photostat is how we would scale our artwork back
    in the pre-digital days. It's a high resolution reproduction made from a camera
    that would output high contrast black and white art onto photo paper. By increasing
    or decreasing the exposure time, we could fatten or thin an image.\r\n\r\nWe would
    take this art and paste it up onto a mechanical, and... \r\n\r\nI could go on,
    but why bother? You're lucky you don't have to do this anymore. Same with specifying
    type by counting characters, cutting rubylith overlays, and all kinds of processes
    that are no longer needed.\r\n"

    should have said this in the beginning.)"
