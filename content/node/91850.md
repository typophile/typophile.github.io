body: "I'm talking about Hunyad / Hunedoara Castle in Hundedoara, Romania. Information
  about the castle: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunyad_Castle|in English]]; [[http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg_Hunedoara|in
  German (more detailed)]].\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/castelul_corvinilor_5499.jpg]\r\nPlease
  visit [[http://alexbeltechi.prosite.com/620/350958/portfolio/the-corvin-castle|this
  page for other photos of the place]].\r\n\r\nWe're looking for appropriate typefaces
  to be used for display purposes in a branding project. \"Appropriate\" could mean
  inspired from that era / matches certain motifs from the buildings / etc.\r\n\r\nHere
  are two typefaces we're considering: [[http://justanotherfoundry.com/herb|JAF Herb]]
  and [[http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Harbour-ALT0000108|Harbour]]. Do you think
  these are appropriate for the period? Do you see any weaknesses in the way they
  are constructed? (I simply don't have the expertise to tell, so any help here would
  be very much appreciated.)\r\n\r\nFeel free to add your own type suggestions. Thanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nPS: This isn't my project. I'm helping [[http://alexbeltechi.prosite.com/620/portfolio|my
  brother]] with a bit of research for his final school project."

    not sure how well it could work as a display one.\r\nWhat about a typeface that
    looks historical but actually isn't?\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/rosenbaum/"

    it comes to text there's no need to be too literal (which doesn't mean a sans

  body: "Thanks all for your suggestions. Litteratra is brilliant! I do agree it would
    look great paired with Grotext. Too bad the latter doesn't have italics (yet?).
    Rosembaun is quite interesting too.\r\n\r\nHrant, is that DTL Fleischmann? Beautiful,
    but pricey, no? I can't even find the price on their site.\r\n\r\nBirdseeding
    \u2014 I see what you did there :)"

    thing: with the display type having so much character, the regular copy should
    probably be less \"in your face\"? \r\n\r\nAmalta is quite nice. Added to the
    list. A pairing with Calluna (the serif, this time), would be nice, no?"

    depends how expressive/reserved you want the whole to be.\r\n2) At text sizes
    this sort of happens automatically.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
