body: "Fonts for teaching Triqui, a language created by a missionary named Barbara
  Hollenbech.\r\n\r\nI have a Triqui Song book that uses underlined fonts.  In Final
  Cut Pro and Type Styler on a Macintosh, none of the fonts use underline and I have
  been trying to use the SIL underline fonts to create a Karaoke file with Apple Applications.\r\n\r\nI
  need a font which has built in underline vowels a, e, i, o, and u, both in Capital
  Letters and non cap letters.  \r\n\r\nNothing from SIL works with the Macintosh
  Applications.\r\n\r\nSeveral people have designed fonts (including me) but upon
  inserting text in Type Styler, they revert to different characters or just don't
  show up.\r\n\r\nHelp\r\n\r\nanyone\r\n\r\nthanks"

  body: You need TypeTool or Fontographer to create a font with the underlines you
    need. Once generated and installed it will work with any application. TypeStyler
    just styles the type you are working with in it - you then can export it but it
    is not a font but a picture of your styling.

    Have you read FontLab's manual on this topic?"

  body: "Ok, I don't get it. \r\n\r\nAre you saying you have taken a font and altered
    it in FontLab, adding an underline to the \"a\" glyph, leaving it in the \"a\"
    position, and that the altered font doesn't display the underline in Final Cut?
    If so, are you renaming the font? How are you installing it? Could it be that
    you just have to clear a font cache? \r\n\r\nOr, are you using an altered glyph
    in a new position? If that's it, what position are you placing the new glyphs
    in? How are you encoding the altered font? What format are you using?\r\n\r\nI
    know nothing of Triqui. Has it an assigned Unicode range?"

  body: "One of the font writers said;\r\n\r\n Gentium1021.zip which contains my modified
    versions of Gentium and Gentium Italic with the extra glyphs in the Private Use
    area. The TTF files have been renamed to avoid confusion with the originals, but
    the fontname is unchanged. To install them, backup your original Gentium fonts,
    uninstall them, and try these.\r\n\r\nThey work fine in Wordpad, so they should
    be OK with other applications besides Word provided you have some means of actually
    typing them. \r\n\r\nIn Wordpad, hold down the alter key and type the codepoints
    57344 to 57348 and press space to insert the capitals. Hold down alter and type
    codepoints 57349 to 57353 to type the lowercase.\r\n\r\nWhat we have done is altared
    a text, modifyed glyphs, created private use area glyps, typed text in Word, copied
    it to Live Type or Final Cut Pro to make it work and it reverts to the assigned
    unicode range.  There is no unicode range assigned to the Triqui language.\r\n\r\nThere
    are three downloadable fonts from SIL that do have the charachers mad but cannot
    be used in Live Type or FCP.\r\n\r\nWe need to import fonts from text files into
    Power Video Karaoke and none of the fonts we have works there either,\r\n\r\nI
    think I am barking up a gree that just isn't there.\r\n\r\nI need the \xE1\xED\xF3\xFA
    as well so that led me to modify some of the others and nothing works with Final
    Cut Pro, Live type or private areas.  Modifying the existing fonts works as well
    though Live type does not recognize the modified glyphs even when Word does.  iMovie
    does as well,  but not Live type....\r\n\r\nI really wanted to use Macintosh but
    I have no Karoke answer there, may need to go back to one of the doze machines.\r\n\r\nSimple
    as it should be, typing in word, making it work, copying to live type and outputting
    a file for use in Final Cut Pro just is not happening.\r\n\r\nThanks, someone
    must know how to make it work.\r\n\r\nbobby\r\n"
