body: If you don't consider the fact that google fonts are free, what would argue
  using a font from fx Fontshop or other suppliers instead of a Google font for an
  App ... are there technical advantages, the general quality of the font or other
  matters to consider? Thanks

  body: "Google also provides hosting services for the Google fonts online, for free.
    And the quality and performance of their infrastructure is astounding.\r\nThe
    higher-quality suppliers sometimes have higher-quality fonts than Google (for
    various senses of \u201Cquality\u201D). But that said, Google does keep upgrading
    their fonts and the gap has been gradually narrowing."
