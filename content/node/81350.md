  Knoll is selling many Oak Knoll press titles at 50% off right now.</a> The sale
  includes books about Tschichold, Goudy, early specimens at Plantin-Moretus, and
  brings the price of Oak Knoll's reprint of Updike\u2019s <em>Printing Types</em>
  to $25.00. It's a good chance to fill out a library without paying high prices for
  what is often not the best printing."
