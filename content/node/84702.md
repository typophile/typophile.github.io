  looking at/for something lo-fo like a typewriter font. But without the 'cheesiness'
  of a typewriter font.\r\nThere's a certain fun and naivety that is conveyed by a
  typewriter face.\r\nAnother, which I've been looking at is Lineto's Simple. It's
  a bit techy though and loses some of the lovely 'naivety' that comes with the typewriter
  style faces.\r\n\r\nLettera seems about right.\r\nLooking for alternatives.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nPaul"

    by Matthew Butterick is my favorite. Also has a very nice cursive, which is rare
    for typewriter faces.
