  are proud to announce the release of two different new fonts. <strong>A 50% discount
  is being offered for a Limited Time</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Machete</strong> is
  the hulky, overfed distant cousin of Bayoneta. Enthusiastically in your face and
  full of humour, Machete is exactly the kind of big alphabet that takes a skinny
  actress camping at the top of a really tall building downtown. If you don't think
  this sort of date is interesting enough, try cramming these letters on your next
  tub of comfort food, road trip comedy, or assault rifle packaging and see. Machete
  don't text. Machete roars!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/machete-pro/\r\n\r\n<strong>Bayoneta</strong>
  is not your usual handcut alphabet, though it can seem so. It can also seem like
  carefully constructed lettering inspired by Polynesian cultures. By bridging that
  gap between knife-wielding kitsch and studied display lettering, Bayoneta offers
  quite a various range of theme possibilities. Its clear and attractive shapes can
  provide the eye-catching spontaneity on a book cover, the expressive shout on a
  skateboard or a muscle shirt, the mouth-watering brand on a protein bar package,
  or the main notice on a theme park ride sign.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/bayoneta-pro/\r\n\r\nMore
