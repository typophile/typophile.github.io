  body: "I agree with you both - the spur at the foot of the G matches Bodoni Poster
    Compressed & Onyx (Bitstream version). Interestingly, the other 3 versions of
    Onyx (http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=onyx) have different shaping
    in this area. I think i'm going to go with the Bodoni version.\r\n\r\nThanks both
    of you for your help & time.\r\n\r\nMike"
