  body: "It is an airline logo. Some other text on the <a href=\"http://www.gestair.com/\">Gestair
    website</a> is set in <a href=\"http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100008\">Gotham</a>.
    The logo very likely started out as Gotham aswell: the G bar has been cut off,
    the R got roughhoused, and the whole thing looks a bit stretched.\r\nF "
