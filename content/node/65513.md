body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI was really hoping there would be a way to justify
  lines by automatically adjusting their font size. I have searched for hours to find
  a solution, but the only solution I can find is ye olde 'do it by hand' method.\r\n\r\nCan
  somebody please help me?\r\n\r\nTo be clear, here are some examples of what I mean:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kua_annual_report_08_4944.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/house_girard_book_10_6565.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/museoslab_2_6653.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aiga-wrap-full_6396.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-lrg_6320.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/9976_6022.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  hope someone can help. Thanks very much in advance!"

  body: "I'd love to know if there is an automated method, too. When I do a type treatment
    like this, I set each line to full justify and stop resizing when the line's spacing
    seems about right. Of course, this can produce slightly irregular spacing if you're
    not careful.\r\n\r\nSomeone could probably write a script for InDesign to do this
    automatically, but I doubt there's one floating around out there. You can check
    the <a href=http://indesignsecrets.com/resources/plug-ins-and-scripts>InDesign
    Secrets</a> scripts page if you want to look for one."

    ancient Chinese trick. It's called math. :-> Set the line at a large point size,
    measure its length (x), determine the desired line-length (y), then multiply the
    original point size by y/x.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Maths don't help with optical margin adjustment tho (and neither does InDesign,
    really). \r\nIf full justification makes optically bad L/R margins (especially
    when you have massive differences in point size), it can be a good idea to make
    the text box slightly too wide, <em>centering</em> the type, and finetuning the
    sizing. (Don't forget to put guidelines where the optical margin should be.)\r\nAnd
    if you need to finetune the left margin, insert a thin space before the first
    character and kern against that.\r\nTakes time! :)"

  body: No need to convert to outlines for real-time scaling. Set up your lines in
    centered and separate text frames (comes in handy for optically adjusted line
    spacing aswell). InDesign lets you scale text frames with their content, just
    press cmd and shift, and grab one of the center handles.
