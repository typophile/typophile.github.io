  Schneidler EF (1936) as the closest match although it is not exact. I mean that
  S is pretty loopy.\r\n\r\nAs this is architecture from 1916, I am now having doubts...
  Is this even a font? (Alternatively, has someone made it into one?)\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much for your time!\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MIT_Building_10.jpg"

  body: actually, many in that same vein but as you said, no exact match in my search
    either. i'd guess that the craftsman had a sample, but the cut probably does not
    match exactly. pre-digital too... maybe one of the more knowledgeable contributors
    can find a match in a specimen book.

  body: "This was the era where major architects developed their own lettering styles.
    The architect of the new MIT campus, William W. Bosworth, modelled this building
    after the Pantheon in Rome. I suspect that the inscription is his idea of an improved
    version of the Trajan column lettering, designed to be effective as a monumental
    incised design. Note that C and G have almost horizontal strokes on the right
    hand side. If  I recall correctly this was not found in American typefaces of
    the day. But perhaps I missed something?\r\nDon"
