  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I don&rsquo;t want to start a flame war against Bill Hill, but does anyone remember what the conversation was about his &ldquo;readable&rdquo; site? I know that dberlow had some fine things to say about it, but I can&rsquo;t seem to find any mention of that thread using Google searches or trying to manually scan old posts. Anyone know the link?</p>
<p>In any case, what brings it up is this comment made by someone on an email list I subscribe to:
<code>
Reading on screen is much harder than reading on paper of various and documented reasons.</p>
<p>The perfect readable webpage has columns, perfect typographic formatted text, no visual clutter/disturbance, pagination and a elastic layout that fits different screen sizes.</p>
<p>I suggest a read-this feature working much like a print-this feature, with usable read friendly text in a modal window like all lightbox clones, with support for dynamic columns and paginating based on character/word count.</p>
<p>check <a href="http://www.billhillsite.com/standardsp1.htm">http://www.billhillsite.com/standardsp1.htm</a> for an example of readable webpage</p>
<p>I`d like to get some feedback on my idea of a read-this feature, with articles/pages 100% optimised for readability.
</code></p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>EDIT
My apologies for posting this edited and out of the original context. No offense was meant.</p>

<p>On which particular display device?</p>
<p>My HDTV? My iPhone? My Kindle? My glossy laptop screen? My 30&quot; desk monitor?</p>
<p>The ultimate issue with this debate is figuring out &lsquo;most readable for which user?&rsquo;?</p>
<p>There are certainly general rules-of-thumb that easily cross over from print, but it&rsquo;s easy to quickly get mired down in the details and lose site of the big picture when figuring out the best way to lay out content on the web site.</p>
<p>Most folks that deal with the web don&rsquo;t believe that columnar text makes any sense online. The reasons include the fact that the screen, in general, is already fairly low-res making it hard to put more than 2-columns on most user agents, combined with the fact that yo have to accommodate a variety of aspect ratios.</p>
<p>In the end, your column-based light-boxish &lsquo;read this&rsquo; sounds cool, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it really ends up being that big of a ROI for the benefit of the individual reading it.</p>
<p>In the end, if you have good content on your site, I&rsquo;m probably reading it in Google Reader anyways ;o)</p>
<p>As for Bill&rsquo;s site, it&rsquo;s completely unreadable in my web browser. It&rsquo;s 40% too wide for my preferences and about 20% too tall, so is actually much bigger of a pain to read than if he had just let it flow as one column.</p>

People respond to the difficulty of onscreen reading in three ways: they suffer without really knowing why; they give up the reading task as soon as possible; or (for the elite) they use every trick in the book to reduce discomfort. I fall into all those categories at different times, especially the last – I put unreasonable effort into printing out web pages so I can read them comfortably over double espresso the next morning.
</cite>
<cite>
For the people who merely sit and suffer, the best we can do is improve their computer’s defaults, as with better and smoother fonts and better screens.

Is a read-friendly feature like the print-friendly feature just a naive bad idea ?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve seen an example of what you are talking about, and I thought it was great. eMusic.com has a very nifty new user interface, and one of the features is that they show an excerpt of the reviews on the left hand sidebar. Upon clicking on it, a nice lightbox-style modal window opens with the full text at a decent size and setting, making it extremely easy to read.</p>
<p>I love the feature.</p>
<p>Now as to columns, it comes down to 3 options: Do I want to have one column a mile long? Do we want to split that single column across multiple pages, or do we want to be more daring and try to fit a variable length and (accessibly) variable sized text into multiple columns?</p>
<p>I hate paged navigation the same way I hate jumps ( SEE MORE ON PAGE B6 ) in a newspaper or magazine design. Multiple columns have yet to appeal to me because of their inconsistency.</p>
<p>That, by default IMHO, makes a single well designed column the best solution. Breaking it out of the page and into a modal box is a grand idea, and I might actually think about implementing something like that in one of my next wordpress designs.</p>

<p>Joe.</p>
<p>Its a good article and deserved credits and links. I did some cut<code>n paste of interesting writings and didn</code>t keep track of who wrote what and it seems like the edit option on this forum has time constrains. That<code>s no excuse for not giving credit when quoting, so I</code>d like to apologise.</p>
<p>The article brings up some really interesting thoughts and I`d like to quote you some more and comment:</p>
<p>Quotes are from Joe Clark`s excellent article &ldquo;Unreadable&rdquo; published in Scroll Magazine: [[http://scrollmagazine.com/number-1/unreadable]]</p>
<p><cite>It is just barely practicable to read a long document on screen if the document is pretty much the only thing on that screen. How often do you see a page like that? Almost never.</p>
<p><cite>Links make it possible to get the hell out of there. Even if a page is so brazen as to contain no links, our browsers helpfully give us a ‘back’ button, a search box, tabs (including methods of displaying 40 tabs at a time), and unlimited bookmarks. HTML gives us a special kind of link, the alternate RSS link, which provides ‘a river of news’.</cite></p>
<p><cite>A link means it’s possible to go somewhere else. Links are intrinsic to the web (and to certain predecessor technologies such as gophers). Links make it seem like you’re doing something wrong if you rest motionless on one page too long. The hyperlink is a Freudian construct – an oral fixation of continuous consumption delivered by automated software. Open wide. </cite></p>
<p><strong>Thats why I`m thinking load about the modal window approach.</strong></p>
<p><cite>People respond to the difficulty of on-screen reading in three ways: they suffer without really knowing why; they give up the reading task as soon as possible; or (for the elite) they use every trick in the book to reduce discomfort. I fall into all those categories at different times, especially the last – I put unreasonable effort into printing out web pages so I can read them comfortably over double espresso the next morning.</cite></p>
<p><cite>For the people who merely sit and suffer, the best we can do is improve their computer’s defaults, as with better and smoother fonts and better screens. But testing shows that really good fonts with really good smoothing increase reading speed by about 5 per cent. That may add up over a workday, but it isn’t make-or-break. And most people cannot alter, let alone improve, their workplace reading environments. There’s little we can do for this group.</cite></p>
<p><strong>On this conclusion I disagree. It might be possible to find better solutions by thinking a little &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><cite> The ultimate issue with this debate is figuring out ’most readable for which user?’?</p>
<p><cite>There are certainly general rules-of-thumb that easily cross over from print, but it’s easy to quickly get mired down in the details and lose site of the big picture when figuring out the best way to lay out content on the web site.</p>
<p><cite>Most folks that deal with the web don’t believe that columnar text makes any sense online. The reasons include the fact that the screen, in general, is already fairly low-res making it hard to put more than 2-columns on most user agents, combined with the fact that yo have to accommodate a variety of aspect ratios.</p>
<p><strong> I would appreciate more information about &ldquo;Most folks that deal with the web don’t believe that columnar text makes any sense online.&rdquo; if you have a url to share.
Is it the technical aspects of css/js programming or the lack of gain in readability that leads to this conclusion ?</strong></p>
<p><cite>In the end, your column-based light-boxish ’read this’ sounds cool, but I’m not sure if it really ends up being that big of a ROI for the benefit of the individual reading it.</p>
<p><strong> If it makes more users read then its beneficial for the publisher/writer ( and probably the reader ) As the Joe Clark quote over says: People dont like to read on the web&hellip;</strong></p>

I for one do see value in having a modal window for content that is meant to be digested, not just consumed.
<p>Joe&rsquo;s comment &ldquo;It is just barely practicable to read a long document on screen if the document is pretty much the only thing on that screen.&rdquo; means to me that the best thing we can do, to have even a remote chance of someone actually reading anything, is to remove as much distraction as we can from the viewport.</p>
<p>That can be accomplished, it&rsquo;s just figuring out how to do it in a way that is acceptable to all/most devices.</p>
<p>As to columns of text, we need to remember why they exist to begin with: The written page. Line lengths cannot be too long. That is a given. But paper has finite boundaries, and a single vertical column of a readable measure cannot fit without being broken into chunks.</p>
<p>But the web is a different medium, and there is practically no limit to the boundaries, so the text can be formatted to fit.</p>

<p>However I see a need for a different solution for textheavy pages users really need to study e.g a 2000 word academic document. Do readers have to print ? If yes, then we all fail in making text on the net readable.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with your first paragraph completely, John, but not the second.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s not a failure of the visual design of a web site that it&rsquo;s difficult to read a huge academic paper online, but rather a failure of the current crop of hardware we use to read said web page.</p>
<p>In the end, large text-heavy documents are really best served on paper. It&rsquo;s just a better medium for the content. That might slowly change with the increase of reflective based screens and portability (ie, the Kindle). But the benefit of the Kindle is, not surprisingly, the fact that it&rsquo;s attempting to emulate paper.</p>
<p>Going back to the first paragraph, there does seem to be a gut reaction by management/directors/editors against scrolling online (WHY ISN&rsquo;T EVERYTHING ON OUR SITE ABOVE THE FOLD!!!??? ;o) but research seems to indicate that people scroll vertically just fine.</p>
<p>When dealing with clients, I often ask them what sites they most often visit. Without a doubt, they tend to be sites that have a ton of content that requires a lot of vertical scrolling (Amazon, Facebook, Ebay, Wikipedia, etc.). I&rsquo;ve found that what we think is the right way to build a web page often isn&rsquo;t the same as how we personally use the web.</p>

<p>I used the Mac version of the Times Reader for a while (trial period) and my impression is that the user experience was very poor. The navigation between articles and sections was clunky and unintuitive. Content updating felt like it took a long time, and the process seemed quite resource (CPU) intensive. In terms of the reading experience, from what I remember, it was not much better than reading from a web page in the browser.</p>

I&rsquo;m not sure anymore what you&rsquo;re quoting, but it&rsquo;s not at all true that newspapers, magazines, books or billboards have been read this way over the 100&rsquo;s of years gone by. After all, with a per-user page description itself a problem, how can anything or anyone on the authoring side effect what else the user has on the screen!? It&rsquo;s just one of the many things about reading on screens that the jump-up-n-down kind like to point to when they don&rsquo;t really understand the problems.</p>
<p>Nick &ldquo;So I would advocate meta-design, so that both page designers and readers have viewing options.&rdquo; 
Me too! That&rsquo;s what the media query and proposed chase query are s&rsquo;posed to do for us.</p>
<p>Mike &ldquo;I have not see the Mac version working&hellip;&rdquo; Me neither but I can tell you the iPhone version is read here every single day without pause or problem. When I used a PC, I used the windows version which was nice for the Times, but the required clout to make fonts happen en masse was lacking.</p>

<p>If I understand you question correct, my answer is that its possible to let users choose a better reading experience, and tailor it to individual settings by giving multiple choices for rendering of coloumns, typography, pagination, scrolling etc.</p>
<p>Should not be that hard to make such solution for some skilled javascript and css coders.</p>
<p>The RIA<code>s like NYT reader are to thick in my opinion for anything else than subscribers and daily readers, but I</code>m sure that the shifting focus in news magazines from print to screen will bring us such solutions by some light (compared to RIA`s )ajax wizardry pretty soon.</p>

I think Amazon is pretty smart — they made a <em>whole new device</em>. MS is almost as smart but their reader is vindoes only, I think. Specify it <em>for the cross-platform web</em>, and don&rsquo;t forget to specify it in such a way as <em>not to improve</em> all web typography and all web composition — i.e. to the point where such a separate function is not crazy. :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/authors/b/mandybrown">http://www.alistapart.com/authors/b/mandybrown</a></p>
<p><cite>In practice, this means you need to limit distractions to the full extent possible. Pull quotes—so effective near the top of an article—become a nuisance further down; many readers will find themselves unconsciously drawn to them, even when they want to focus on the text. Attention to the basic typographic details—line length, a readable typeface, the right balance between font size and line height, appropriate contrast between the text and background—can make the difference between a reader who makes it to the end of the article versus one who tires and gives up.</p>
<p><cite>Whitespace is not so much a luxury as it is a prerequisite. Every pixel of whitespace around the text can help the reader stay focused instead of wandering off. A readers’ eyes must repeatedly approach the edge of the text block; a sidebar that is set too close to the text—or one that is brighter or darker in color—will compete with her on every line. Even a small increase in padding between text and sidebar (especially if the sidebar includes more text) can make for a more restful page, and reinforce the reader’s own sense of solitude.</p>
<p><cite>It’s also important to consider the chronology of the reading experience. The initial transition from looking to reading is followed by an intense, concentrated period in which the reader is lost in the text. At the end of a piece, however, the reader once again comes up for air, and is likely to return to the state of looking (and browsing) that got her here in the first place. The design of the page should respect these three distinct phases: first, by inviting the reader in; second, by leaving her alone; and third, by providing avenues for her to continue to pursue her interests.</p>

<p>Well, you tell me David. Your the expert on that part of the &ldquo;readable web elephant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>David Berlow at <a href="http://www.rogerblack.com/blog/second_font_war">http://www.rogerblack.com/blog/second_font_war</a> :</p>
<p><cite>  My solution is based on the type designer providing multiple drawings, like multiple masters, but instead of defining weight or width in the multiple styles, the type designer provides contours to match the grid size of particular sizes, like 8, 12 and 16. So the type designer is positioning the outline precisely on the low-resolution grid, a fit that is much closer than hinting can ever achieve. The designer controls the exact color of each feature of each character in the a way that produces an optimized result for any font and any script at any size, without having to write software, (hints).</p>
<p>Is your solution released by now, or is it possible to test it ?</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<cite>
Alas, Web designers are resisting new ideas like the Times Reader. But Web designers rejected Flash in the beginning, too. Perhaps it's unsettling for the digerati to realize that their new paradigm is already getting old.
<cite>
For the rest of us, the possibility of richer forms for Internet media is welcome. Communications will continue on the HTML Web, but now more-compelling storytelling in text and motion pictures is being brought online by new "clients" like Flash and WPF.
<cite>
This may still not feel like home for old print designers who like to do things one page at a time, like artists. But TV, magazines, and newspapers are converging online and will soon enough appear on portable, cheap screens, carrying the branding of the old world, like the Times Reader. It won't be the old experience, though; it will have to be interactive.
<cite>
Designers won't have much success in this new world if they try to design each rich screen one at a time. Already, the best Web designers make templates that work together in a design system. Why not make it possible for the users to adapt these as they see fit?
<cite>
Maybe the way for designers to take control of the medium is to let it go. They should just design templates for everyone to use.

<p><cite>While general consensus was found with regard to the best readability and
line length in the above experiments, there have always been some inconsistent
results. First, the similar readability was found irrespective of the line length
as far as the line length does not exceed a certain limit [2]. Second, the optimum
line length that corresponds to optimum readability differed depending on
researchers and experiments [2,3].

<p>What&rsquo;s to blame in this case? Well, personally I don&rsquo;t think reversed text on any backlit background is a good idea unless one has a specially-tuned font, but a more important point needs to be made about ‘readable webpages’ that has relatively little to do with design. Note that I wrote that I found the main copy on Roger&rsquo;s site difficult to read in ‘normal’ mode <em>on my screen</em>. This obviously implies, also, my text rendering environment and my browser. Given the variations introduced by both software and hardware, I think the idea that readability can be optimally addressed independently by design is clearly untenable.</p>
<p>The kind of adaptive layout for different sizes windows and devices being worked on by MS is a Good Thing in terms of document-level readability (e.g. retaining story hierarchy within different arrangements). Text-level readability is going to remain an impossible-to-hit target as long as my computer is different from your computer, and as long as web designers want to tell me in what font I am going to be viewing their content.</p>

<p>Is readability on the bottom of the priority list ?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, your last comments suggest that you think we disagree, which would be a pity, because I don&rsquo;t think we do, at least not about the nature of the problem.</p>
<p>We have a situation in which the variables on the client side are so numerous and of such kinds that design, occurring on the publisher side, cannot hope to provide optimum readability because design is not able to address or, indeed, even to know which variables are ‘in play’. This is the current situation. You have suggested a method to push beyond this situation, which is to provide separate outlines tailored to at least some of those variables, but of course the other half of this solution requires mechanisms for software to identify the addressable variables in play and to call the appropriate outline set. I think this would be pretty cool, but I&rsquo;m not holding my breath, because it is contrary to the direction in which all the major software developers are pushing. [Insert denouncements here.]</p>
<p>Aside from the implementation issues, I&rsquo;m not convinced that this method, which would certainly improve the situation, fundamentally alters it: there are variables of screen gamma &ndash; almost certainly one of the factors making Roger&rsquo;s white-on-red text difficult for me to read &ndash; and variables of individual perception that are not programmatically addressable by the mechanism of tailored outlines. And so far as they are addressable, just how many sets of outlines is it reasonable to produce? And given that new variables are being created all the time, how many new sets of outlines for the same typeface will need to be produced to keep up with the variables? And given that all this development costs money, won&rsquo;t customers simply choose to settle for less-than-optimum readability simply because it is cheaper?</p>
<p>Every once in a while, when I&rsquo;m in a bookshop and find a book that I think I might like to read, I discover that it is so badly typeset or printed that I don&rsquo;t buy it. As I&rsquo;m regretfully putting that badly produced book back on the shelf, I usually reflect that if I had the opportunity to re-typeset that book, I would be able to read it. And that is pretty much my experience of the Internet too, with the difference that I <em>can</em> change the appearance of the text of electronic documents, and optimum readability &ndash; which is a phrase that only has meaning on the display end, on the reader side, not on the design end or the publisher side &ndash; is ultimately only achievable by me for me. This isn&rsquo;t as easy as it should be, and it is becoming more difficult, not less so. One the the principle benefits of electronic text is that it doesn&rsquo;t have a fixed form, but this is apparently not seen as a benefit by many designers, who want to control the appearance of text even though they have no way of knowing what I, the recipient, am actually seeing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some hope — 13 pixel per em Verdana, with standard leading in a 62-70 character line, black upon a 96 dpi screen and a slightly yellow background, pick your rendering. I do not mean to prove you directly wrong in front of millions of 1/1000ths of readers, but design <em>not</em> being able to address some variables is a lilliputian technical issue these days. Design being able to address <em>all</em> variables is a non-lilliputian technical issue under development these days.</p>

<p>&quot; One the the principle benefits of electronic text is that it doesn’t have a fixed form, but this is apparently not seen as a benefit by many&hellip;&quot;</p>
<p>[readers] not designers. I think there is a tissue of misunderstanding that connects the wave of readability quests, IP upsets, standards discussions and open source font queries, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have suggested a method to push beyond this situation, which is to provide separate outlines&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never suggested multiple outlines jus' m.. ma&hellip; mad.. made &lsquo;em. Demonstrating sound x metrics is not otherwise possible short of bitmaps. All I have &lsquo;suggested&rsquo; by that study is that there is a gap between what we have and what we can have in that one qualitative aspect from which <em>all</em> other quality cascades in the domain we discuss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;if I had the opportunity to re-typeset that book&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Y&hellip; yo&hellip;you, had an opportunity to re-typeset everybody&rsquo;s screens. You went for the color of the printed page and no special quality for the screen with a technology claiming to be patented to &lsquo;do something about it&rsquo;, (the screen):-?</p>

<p>Well, apart from the fact that Verdana&rsquo;s default linespacing is too tight &ndash; so you must mean something else by &lsquo;standard leading&rsquo; &ndash;, the web designer has no way of knowing whether my screen is 96dpi or not, and if he specifies type in pixel sizes he&rsquo;s an idiot. 13 pixels: what&rsquo;s that? 7pt? 9pt? 11pt? Yes. Okay, so the web designer can fairly reliably specify black text on a slightly yellow background, although how yellow that background actually is on my screen is yet another thing he can&rsquo;t know. And who picks the rendering? Him? Me? Bill Gates?</p>

<p>13 ppem is a different physical size on each of my three computers, because they each have a different pixel pitch. Ergo, font size defined relative to the em will produce different ppem sizes on different devices for the same reason. But at least that is doing it correctly.</p>

That is because it is. I didn&rsquo;t say there was hope for everyone from this one single confluence. 
<img src="/images/old-images/Hope_4192.gif" alt="">
Looks much better on the Mac.</p>
<p>The discussion subject refers to the ‘perfect readable webpage’. All I’m saying is that perfection — or what I would call optimal, is only achievable from the publisher side, when all reasonable variables on the reader side are addressable. I think the age-old paradigm dating back to antiquity, informing most design into having particular appearances, is fundamentally indivisible from client requirements, even when it comes to electronic text media. This is allowed by technology, as it always has been, until the web.<em> I too want to pull content and view it in a way that suits me,</em> but I recognize, along with millions of others who know that there is lot of content out there intended to be targeted to a particular experience, and they want that experience from the next generation of authors, down to their text.</p>
<p>But I moved to an island in part to get away from John&rsquo;s Continent, (I guess it&rsquo;s safe to move back now?), and to have more control over the things to which my senses are exposed.  So perhaps I’m just grumpy about letting other people tell me how I must write. I reminds me quite a bit of Adobe&rsquo;s 1988-9 saying there was no need for type 1 fonts besides Adobe&rsquo;s, but on a larger and much sinisterer scale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;throwing this into the mix&rdquo;
This is a very important part of the mix, but that is one thing: removing the dancing baloney, stationary baloney and faux navigation. E-book devices, and the iPhone e.g., do the same thing and profited from it &lsquo;till now. But as long as a bulk of users sit in front of Windows machines having appearance dictated to them, people will feel compelled to do studies, make other devices and move it along ahead of Windows. With or without dancing baloney, there is still type to read.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>A more sophisticated implementation of a similar idea is the <a href="http://userstyles.org/stylish/"><em>Stylish</em> add-on</a> for Firefox.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, they say &ldquo;Ignorance is bliss!&rdquo;, and I guess that&rsquo;s true, since I&rsquo;ve been wandering along blithely unaware of this  particular flamewar until Mike Duggan sent me the link&hellip;</p>
<p>Please excuse this fairly long posting.</p>
<p>The folks who&rsquo;ve criticized the pages on my website: <a href="http://www.billhillsite.com/">http://www.billhillsite.com/</a> don&rsquo;t seem to have read the caveats in the content. I didn&rsquo;t claim these pages were great - or even readable - on all browsers on all platforms today, even though they were all created using Web-standards markup.</p>
<p>The awful screen shots which a couple of the posters to this thread have shown are the direct result of not having the right fonts on the system. They are, indeed, very ugly.</p>
<p>The pages were designed as examples, to prove to myself and anyone who took the time to read and follow the instructions that it was possible to create Web pages which can approach the readability of print using Web standards markup and good fonts.</p>
<p>They were created to explore a way forward, not to be compatible everywhere today. So they do currently have to be viewed in the right setup.</p>
<p>They were built using Notepad++ on a 1440 x 900 MacBook Pro, running Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista, and were designed to be viewed FullScreen, to remove all other distractions.</p>
<p>They use Embedded OpenType fonts, which work only on Internet Explorer so far (that&rsquo;s a whole separate flamewar). I&rsquo;m not certain, because I haven&rsquo;t tried them in earlier versions of IE, whether these pages will work exactly right there. IE has supported EOT font embedding in all versions since 1996, but the pages use CSS 2.1 and CSS3 markup, and while IE8 has seen huge improvement in this area, earlier versions of IE may not render properly. I didn&rsquo;t explore this in detail, because as I said I&rsquo;m looking forward, not back.</p>
<p>You can pick up RC1 of IE8 from: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/beta/">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/beta/</a>.</p>
<p>If the fonts don&rsquo;t render correctly on any page, try hitting refresh - there&rsquo;s a bug (now fixed).</p>
<p>However, because the fonts used are the ClearType-optimized ones which shipped with Windows Vista and Office2007/MacOffice2008, they also view properly on other browsers if they have those fonts. I believe you can also get them by downloading the Office2007 document compatibility pack for Microsoft Office 2003.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried the pages in FireFox, Safari and Chrome, and they work pretty well if you are running any of those on Windows Vista. They ought to work if you&rsquo;re running on Windows XP with Office 2007 installed, or on a Macintosh with MacOffice2008. But I haven&rsquo;t tried, myself.</p>
<p>In all those cases, the right fonts should be in your system without needing the downloadable EOT font objects, and the pages should render the way they were intended - especially now that Safari 4 on Windows is using native Windows rendering to get much better text.</p>
<p>I know there are people who will disagree with that last statement, but personally I&rsquo;ve always found Apple&rsquo;s sub-pixel rendering too blurry for sustained reading. IMO, Apple&rsquo;s rendering gives results which are closer to the character shapes of fonts when printed, but at the expense of clarity and edge-sharpness at body text sizes (the critical sizes for reading), at which we use hinting to snap edges to high-contrast sub-pixel boundaries and thus gain some sharpness. In this case I believe obedience is just a little blind, because we don&rsquo;t yet have the screen resolutions for it to work properly.</p>
<p>To see the full pages to best effect, your display needs to be 1440 x 900 or better. Currently Safari (and Chrome) appear to have no way to take a Webpage FullScreen and get rid of all chrome. FF uses the same F11 shortcut as IE.</p>
<p>There are occasional glitches with the multicolumn layout on a couple of pages (especially in FF, perhaps I used the CSS3 standard markup and not the &ldquo;moz-&rdquo; specific version).</p>
<p>The multicolumn Javascript I found on the Web is a bit of a hack really. Since it uses the Document Object Model (DOM), its lowest level of granularity is the paragraph element in HTML.</p>
<p>That means when it has to break a long paragraph at the bottom of a column, it has problems deciding exactly where. In fact, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly do it properly at that level - you need to be able to get down to the granularity of the individual word, or hyphenated word-part.</p>
<p>To overcome that problem, I&rsquo;ve had to do some creative copy-editing. That&rsquo;s not tenable for real-world pages, but was OK for examples.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t expect to have this problem at all once native multicolumn support makes it into all the browsers, and the composition engines - which are a lot more sophisticated than that Javascript - are making the column-breaking decisions. Of course, the engines will also have to paginate the content - multicolumn &ldquo;reading&rdquo; content without pagination makes little sense, except for single pages with a limited amount of content.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in my pages, I express regret that at this time they had to be designed for a fixed size. The Web really needs a more dynamic, adaptive layout system. It can be done; I&rsquo;ve seen it in proprietary formats like the New York Times Reader and what Adobe has shown recently. I&rsquo;ve also seen it done in HTML, but it&rsquo;s not mainstream yet.</p>
<p>This kind of layout will need an entirely new approach to design, new HTML markup (probably) and certainly new tools. We&rsquo;ve been designing for fixed spaces since the first cavemen painted on walls. But there&rsquo;s no such thing as a &ldquo;fixed page size&rdquo; on the Web, and we need a new design paradigm.</p>
<p>Designers have done their best to drag the &ldquo;fixed-space&rdquo; design paradigm into the new world, but it doesn&rsquo;t really work. Examples I&rsquo;ve seen so far of so-called &ldquo;liquid layout&rdquo; in HTML don&rsquo;t fully do the job either.</p>
<p>Typophile is the kind of forum in which we could really have meaningful dialog about all these issues; it&rsquo;s a huge body of collective knowledge and smartness, and I&rsquo;d love to see civilized discussion, debate and disagreement here.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not interested in a flamewar, rudeness, bad manners, profanity, or any of the other behavior seen all too often, which is why I don&rsquo;t monitor these discussions all the time.</p>
<p>If people really just want to have a war, they can have it without me. But I&rsquo;ll try to respond to all civil postings.</p>

<p>Joe wrote:
Newspaper articles, magazines, books, and billboards are not surrounded by blinking Flash advertisements and they aren’t blasting megapixels of bright white light horizontally at you as you sit bolt upright in your office chair.</p>
<p>I know Joe disagrees with my approach, but maybe that&rsquo;s my fault and I&rsquo;ve failed to clearly explain my thinking. Because I agree completely with his criticism of Web page distractions (and the white light, too), and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to address in my own way.</p>
<p>A single narrow (therefore readable) column of black text on a white background is painful to try to read onscreen, because there&rsquo;s far too much white blasting out at you from the rest of the display.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I use white text on a black background in my blog:</p>
<p><a href="http://billhillsblog.blogspot.com">http://billhillsblog.blogspot.com</a></p>
<p>White-on-black is not ideal. However, I found it to be the best compromise option for me on Blogger. I tend to write longer pieces. As soon as readers get down below the first screen, they end up with one narrow column of text and nothing else on the screen. I tried alternative templates, but ended up choosing the white-text-black-background because it gave the best contrast without blinding readers.</p>
<p>IMO multi-column text, especially if it has good word-spacing (which requires hyphenation), can tone down the &ldquo;blasting white megapixels&rdquo; enough to be made comfortable. When typographers talk about the &ldquo;color&rdquo; of a page, they don&rsquo;t mean yellow or blue, they mean the comfortable uniform &ldquo;grayness&rdquo; of well-set text, best seen when you blur your eyes.</p>
<p>If you want someone to read comfortably, nothing on the screen can flash, or move. But adverts can be beautiful without that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to sit down and talk with Joe for a few hours sometime. I get the feeling we might have a lot more in common than he thinks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let’s list Bill Hill’s mistakes, if only to prove that, months later, he still hasn’t learned.</p>
<ul><li>CSS isn’t markup; HTML is.</li>
<li>“Web-standards markup,” which isn’t the term of art in the first place, produces pages that <em>do</em> look right in every browser or device that can render the markup <em>provided one uses the right CSS</em>.</li>
<li>You’re supposed to specify a list of fonts in your CSS declarations, ideally terminating with generic designations like <code>serif</code> and <code>sans-serif</code>. A page looking borked because the viewer doesn’t have the “right” fonts is the fault of an author who wrote lousy CSS.</li>
<li>Web pages  will not “approach the readability of print” if they ape 19th- and 20th-century print layouts, complete with callouts. These are malleable luminous screens we’re dealing with, not dead trees.</li>
<li>Any rational standardista will not insist that pages be viewed at any specific resolution or in any specific mode (viz “full screen”), as those are anathema to Web standards and accessibility. Now, admittedly, not every conceivable outcome can be foreseen by the designer, but obvious ones can be (screen, print, projection), and two of those three need not have anything to do with resolution. Really, this point is a recapitulation of other points; arguing it is like arguing about what a stop sign means. It’s just accepted by everyone else.</li>
<li>The Web already <em>has</em> “a... dynamic, adaptive layout system”; it’s called CSS. (You’re soaking in it!) Look up “fluid layouts.” (Really look them up instead of opening a few pages in IE8 and deciding they don’t “work.”) Use CSS to make <em>Web pages</em> instead of simulacra of venerated print layouts and you might get somewhere. As you note, without apparent understanding, there <em>are</em> no fixed spaces on the Web and we <em>do</em> need a new paradigm, part of which we already have. It’s just that it doesn’t look like a layout from <cite>Punch</cite>, <cite>The Saturday Evening Post</cite>, or <cite>Spy</cite>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I disagree with your approach, Bill, because it’s the wrong approach. You showed no evidence you knew what you’re doing at the launch of BillHillSite and show no such evidence now.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> people who understand graphic design, typography (not the same thing), <em>and</em> the Web. As I wrote before, if Microsoft were serious about this it would hire those people to create actually compliant designs that worked with sexy new embedded fonts. As usual, Microsoft has more money than God but not enough taste.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John: &ldquo;&hellip;if he specifies type in pixel sizes he’s an idiot.&rdquo;
perhaps I&rsquo;m misunderstanding, or know a lot of idiots then, I think we all do.</p>
<p>Part of the &lsquo;new paradigm&rsquo; is that objects are often specified as a portion of the units-per-page, and not as a portion of an inch, or any other old-paradigm measuring system — type is one such object. Point size, though useful in part of the old paradigm, was part of a sizing system based on arm length, age, and static pages of static content. Inches took over when the type sizing of the old paradigm was based on leg work, weather and dynamic pages of static content. And now we have all these measuring systems in the new paradigm.</p>
<p>But onward. There&rsquo;s sense in &lsquo;improving&rsquo; how people specify type size, sense in disapproving bad type/background color schemes and sense in barking at adjacent distracting content. Where&rsquo;s it go? To specific apps that strip text content from a page and only present text? You still want to render better text. Everyone can huddle around the unchangeable facts. Then, you still have to render better text. Search Google for &lsquo;white pixels blasting my eyes&quot; = 0. Search Google for &lsquo;blasting my eyes&rsquo; with &lsquo;computer screen&rsquo; = 171. The whitest blue of the sky above is hardly blasting people.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of different searches you can do on similar combinations sleuthing for the white pixel demon, and many of them find 1,300 to 1,700 matches (not thousands). Search on &lsquo;fuzzy text&rsquo; with &lsquo;windows machine&rsquo; and hundreds of thousands of matches are found. It is likely that a proportional number of Mac users feel and express the same. And yet, there are billions of users of white backgrounds — billions.  Where&rsquo;s it go? To a specific function that colors text to the user&rsquo;s desired preference. Then, you still have to render better text.</p>
<p>Speaking of which&hellip;</p>
<p>Bill: &ldquo;But there’s no such thing as a “fixed page size” on the Web, and we need a new design paradigm.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s hard to imagine anyone believing this more than I do. Buy while the additional font technologies required to address this new design paradigm languish in committees with no intention of moving anytime soon, don&rsquo;t you think it should be possible to replicate that old paradigm trivially to the extent possible in the new technologies? Despite the wonderfulness of the new technology, shouldn&rsquo;t I be able to set a pretty darn good Gutenburg Bible right here? The mother DNA comes before the chicken or the egg, much less the western omelet you desire.</p>
<p>Bill: &ldquo;&hellip; because we don’t yet have the screen resolutions for it (CT) to work properly.&rdquo;
That is one way of putting it, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the resolution&rsquo;s fault&rsquo; ;) Another way is that Microsoft did not develop, (and patent(s)), a font technology suited for reading in the resolution spectrum employed by the then existing and now continuing bulk of users of desktop computers running XP, Vista and Windows 7. It&rsquo;s not nice to fool mother patent office.</p>
<p>Bill:&quot;&hellip;we use hinting to snap edges to high-contrast sub-pixel boundaries and thus gain some sharpness.&quot;
One of my porcupinionated points is that if a type designer, or someone skilled in the word-making arts, does not have control over where that &lsquo;some sharpness&rsquo; is in the forming of words, what does getting the rest &lsquo;right&rsquo; get for you, (lines, ppgs and columns), (leaving colors and surrounding content out of it for now)? You still have to render better text.</p>
<p>Excuse the long post and not even a poke at Clark&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>Having a decent discussion about web readability benefits everyone, literally millions of people, if and when the cogs at the center of the machine start turning in response.</p>

Feb 12 is the day IE6 dies. At least we have that going for us.</p>

<p>David: <em>perhaps I’m misunderstanding, or know a lot of idiots then, I think we all do.</em></p>
<p>By &lsquo;specifies type in pixels&rsquo; I mean using the CSS px unit to specify size. The reason this is an idiotic idea is that a pixel is a non-scaleble object of variant size, i.e. not-all pixels are the same size, so if you specify the size of something using px it will be a different size on different monitor resolutions. So, for example, specifying 13px as a font size will result in anywhere from 13pt down to less than 5pt depending on the monitor resolution.</p>
<p>Some of the CSS reference guides I&rsquo;ve looked at classify px as a ‘relative’ measurement unit, in contrast to ‘absolute’ measurement units. In fact, px is a unique kind of measurement, not truly relative because it cannot be scaled, and not truly absolute because it does not have a fixed size.</p>

<p>While originally true in some browsers, these days its somewhat moot as most of the major browsers have adapted a &lsquo;page zoom&rsquo; method of resizing ala the iPhone.</p>
<p>So, there could be argued a benefit of using a px as it&rsquo;ll relate directly to the other visual elements on the displayed page (ie, images).</p>
<p>Furthermore, AFAIK, most browsers have no idea what my PPI settings are for my display short of actually asking me in preferences. As such, they make assumptions and convert pt measurements to px at some point in the rendering.</p>

I HATE page zoom. It assumes that I want to scroll all over the darn place, when I certainly do not. IMO, it&rsquo;s an easy out for web designers because they think they don&rsquo;t need to build for accessibility anymore. Please let me know when screen readers implement page zoom :)</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s what raster imaging is all about: converting scaled vector graphics or type specified in absolute non-pixel sizes to appropriate pixel sizes and patterns. The key is that the conversion happens relative to the pixel resolution of the output device, i.e. at the display stage where that information is available to the rasteriser. This is all very sensible. What is not sensible is a designers specifying pixel sizes independent and ignorant of the resolution of the output device.</p>

With the additional caveat that most browsers interpret those settings practically arbitrarily. When I first started web design, I would set things in pts because that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m familiar with. But now everything is either px or ems because that&rsquo;s the only way to make sure that things are reasonably consistent. (Which isn&rsquo;t a big problem to me, but when my boss starts yelling because her website looks different on her Windows 98 machine than from my brand new Mac running Safari 4 Beta, then I need to set professional priorities&hellip;)</p>
<p>Also, most javascript functionality is px dependent. It kinda sucks that way.</p>

If you search here you&rsquo;ll find previous posts, years ago, on the lost importance of &ldquo;actual size&rdquo;. The display devices have been standardized to report correctly, and I&rsquo;m not going any further on that particular topic. :)</p>
<p>Johhhhhn: &ldquo;What is not sensible is a designers specifying pixel sizes independent and ignorant of the resolution of the output device.&rdquo; 
Stop, you&rsquo;re hurting my new paradigm! What is sensible? Type designers making font designs independent and ignorant of the size, resolution or rendering of the output device? :)</p>
<p>Dan: &ldquo;But now everything is either px or ems because that’s the only way to make sure that things are reasonably consistent.&rdquo;
And fonts are no different &ldquo;to make sure&rdquo; as you can see from the Franky exercise on Roger&rsquo;s site.</p>
<p>Dan: &ldquo;It kinda sucks that way.&rdquo;
Don&rsquo;t it though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benton had completed his self instruction in typefounding and found himself on the most intimate terms with decimal fractions and measurements of ten thousandths of an inch. He had and still has a mania for accuracy to the vanishing point, not only knowing, as the books tell us, that a hot breath impinged on a small piece of steel changes its dimensions, but actually taking that solemn fact to heart, grieving that it cannot be overcome. The bane of Benton&rsquo;s career has been the limitations of error which are made necessary by the disposition of all metals to refuse to resist molecular action. What other mortals cheerfully accept as accuracy Benton regards as a calamity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come a long way baby, to face a whole new kind of vanishing point!

<p>@DanGayle not sure I HATE it, but as a user/viewer, I definitely preferred the old way (just resize the text). As a web developer, though, I have to admit that the new way is a bit easier of us web developers to accommodate (as you state).</p>
<p>And, given the abundance of g and iPhones, where that&rsquo;s the defacto UI, I guess more folks are going to grow up with that method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is not sensible is a designers specifying pixel sizes independent and ignorant of the resolution of the output device.&rdquo;</p>
<p>@John Hudson &hellip;I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m following you. The designer is as ignorant about the PPI as is the browser rasterizer. Both are making assumptions. Both typically assume 96ppi, which is rarely, if ever, actually accurate.</p>
<p>The problem is that most PC OSes are still pixel based. They haven&rsquo;t made the leap to real-world measurements. Hopefully that&rsquo;ll happen soon and we&rsquo;ll be able to say 1 inch and it WILL be 1 inch independent of the particular display device being used. We may have to wait for PPI to make a major leap up before that happens, though.</p>

<p>That is both the glory and the curse of scaleable type: it can be whatever size you need it to be, and will hardly ever be the size it should be. This isn&rsquo;t a pixel-world issue, per se, but an old issue given a pixelated expression. If you want to dump the whole notion of scaleable type, then I might be willing to carry your banner, but my take on the current situation is that if we presume scaleable type, then we have to also presume that neither the web designer nor the font designer is able to determine what the reader needs. As I wrote much earlier in this thread, the only person who can determine what the reader needs is the reader.</p>
<p>Darrel:<em>The designer is as ignorant about the PPI as is the browser rasterizer. Both are making assumptions. Both typically assume 96ppi, which is rarely, if ever, actually accurate.</em></p>
<p>See above. If both the web designer and the browser are making independently incorrect assumptions about resolution, this only underlines the point I have made repeatedly in this thread: only readers can accurately determine appropriate size &ndash; and hence leading and line-length &ndash; for the text they see before them, since only they can see it and only they have to read it.</p>
<p>[Note, by the way, for the sake of accuracy that generally the browser is not the rasteriser; rather, it calls a system rasteriser or other external library.]</p>

<p>Well, screen resolutions have taken major leaps and they are available. What hasn&rsquo;t taken a major leap is the market for higher resolution screens: the prices are too high for average users and the laptop and monitor manufacturers are flooding the market with cheap low resolution screens. This, in turn, inhibits software and design development targeted at higher resolution displays, particularly scaleable OS.</p>

<p>I only said web designers spec&rsquo;ing type in pixels were idiots. Readers are actually looking at the pixels, so they know how big those pixels are and whether 13ppem equals e.g. 12pt or 6pt. The reader is the only person qualified to spec type in pixels.</p>
<p>Web designers who specify type in pixels are kind of like the dead people in <em>The Sixth Sense</em>: they&rsquo;re walking around like normal people and they don&rsquo;t know that they&rsquo;re idiots, because most of them have the same crappy monitors as most other computer users, and they&rsquo;ve never spent time working on and reading web pages on e.g. a 145ppi screen. I have, and this is why I know that spec&rsquo;ing type in pixels is idiotic. But certainly not more idiotic that spec&rsquo;ing entire operating systems in pixels.</p>

Font rendering is perhaps one of the last areas where type designers can assist the manufacturers and programmers in the world to not make our fonts look crappy. As such, we have to have hope, right?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that a pixel is an object of fixed size, i.e. an actual pixel on a screen. The problem is that not all pixels are the same size. Some pixels are 1/72 of an inch, some are 1/96 of an inch, some are 1/120 inch, some are 1/133 of and inch, some are 1/145 of an inch, and some are 1/200 of an inch. And that&rsquo;s just enumerating the different sizes of pixels on screens I have worked with over the past decade. [I haven&rsquo;t calculated the ppi of my new monitor, but I reckon it is somewhere around 120ppi. For most of the past five years I was using a 145ppi screen (Dell laptop), and before that a 133ppi screen (Toshiba laptop).]</p>
<p>So the question I have for web designers is &lsquo;Would you knowingly spec 6.5pt type for your main body size in a book or newspaper?&rsquo; And I guess the answer is no. But that&rsquo;s what I had to put up with on a lot of websites when using a 145ppi screen. Sure, I could hit ctrl-+ on every page to increase the type size, but readers shouldn&rsquo;t have to do that.</p>
<p>David thinks I&rsquo;m elitist because I buy screens with higher than average resolutions. I think the price of such screens is artificially high, because they don&rsquo;t cost that much more to make than low resolution screens.</p>
<hr>
<p>David, when I say that readers ‘know’ how big the pixels they are looking at are, I don&rsquo;t mean they know the exact dimensions (nor do they have any need to know). I mean they know how big they are in the same way that you know how far you are from an object, because you are experiencing that space directly. Readers know how big the pixels on their screens are because they are looking at them: they know that they are <em>that big</em>.</p>

The iphone, for instance, has a pretty crazy PPI (comparatively speaking). 9px type is unreadable That said, spec&rsquo;ing type in pts or ems get translated back into relative pixels by the browser anyways, and also would be unreadable. Hence the zoom UI.</p>
<p>IMHO, in the real world, right now, the specific units of measurements used in a page layout online don&rsquo;t have really strong pros/cons between them. That may (hopefully?) change.</p>
<p>If a browser would know the PPI and able to properly translate pts/ems/cm/etc to actual measurements independent of the pixel sizes, I think we&rsquo;d all be happier. ;)</p>

What about apps/web pages that are tailored to fit the iPhone? For instance, the Google apps don&rsquo;t require you to zoom. <em>They</em> specify the page size and font size, and zoom doesn&rsquo;t really work.</p>
<p>If you know approximates, i.e., such and such browser is 1440px wide or 300px wide, in addition to the User Agent, you can set things to be consistent for users on different platforms without having to fall back to zoom, which again, I think is a crutch.</p>

<p>But that could be done intelligently and accurately. Actually, it used to be done intelligently in FireFox, because the user could set the screen resolution. For some reason that feature seems to have disappeared, so I guess there must have been some issue with it, but I still think the idea was sound. Ideally, the browser should be able to get that information from the system, but failing that, getting it from the user is a good idea. The UI was quite nice, because it didn&rsquo;t require the user to actually know what the ppi resolution was: all he had to do was measure a line on the screen with a real ruler and enter the length in a box in inches or mm. From that, the browser would calculate the number of ppi and could accurately scale any inch-convertible unit such as typographic points.</p>
<p><em>If a browser would know the PPI and able to properly translate pts/ems/cm/etc to actual measurements independent of the pixel sizes, I think we’d all be happier.</em></p>
<p>Exactly. If type is spec&rsquo;d in points, one knows exactly how big it is going to be in high res print, and one knows fairly accurately how big it is going to be in low res print despite visible rounding. The printer type doesn&rsquo;t need to be spec&rsquo;d in dots, because the output device knows how to accurately rasterise e.g. 10pt type to an appropriate number of dots for the resolution of the device. And we think this is normal and would be shocked if it didn&rsquo;t work, if nominally 10pt type were a radically different size on different printers because they were all presupposing a resolution that was different from their actual resolution. But somehow we&rsquo;ve accepted a situation on screen, despite using the same fonts and an entirely parallel raster imaging rendering model, in which we think it is normal and acceptable for the text layout to be ignorant of the resolution of the output device.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Joe, the CSS spec defines px is &lsquo;pixels, relative to the viewing device&rsquo;. So, yes, it is a relative measurement insofar as it is not an absolute measurement in the sense that a centimetre is an absolute measurment, but on any specific viewing device the actual pixels have a fixed dimension, so the px measurement becomes absolute at the moment something sized in px is displayed on a particular device. A 600x400 pixel graphic on my screen is a fixed size; if I zoom or otherwise enlarge the graphic, it is no longer 600x400 pixels. Of course px-specified text can and should be scaleable, but when it is scaled, like the image, it is no longer the number of pixels specified; so what we&rsquo;re really saying is not that px is a relative measure in the same way that e.g. em or ex are relative, but that the px measurement may change relative to scaling values. But in the same way that one cannot know e.g. how big 13px will be unless one knows the ppi resolution of the particular viewing device, one also cannot know what is an appropriate scaling factor for px-spec&rsquo;d sizes. Yes, px-spec&rsquo;d type can be scaled, but the reader is the only person involved in the publishing and consumption of a web page who knows <em>how much</em> he needs to scale px-spec&rsquo;d type in order to make it comfortably readable on his particular viewing device.</div>

<p>&ldquo;it is no longer the number of pixels specified&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, it is. The browser is just increasing the size of the &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; pixel.</p>
<p>If I spec a web site to use 10px type, it won&rsquo;t necessarily literally end up being 10 monitor pixels high. It could vary depending on end-user preferences/changes and software assumptions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;but the reader is the only person involved in the publishing and consumption of a web page who knows how much he needs to scale px-spec’d type&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s true regardless of the measurement the designer chooses. The issue is that they are all relative measurements in reality.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ both Dan and John: I can&rsquo;t stand zoom, either. And I LONG for absolute measurements.</p>
<p>The human eye doesn&rsquo;t know from pixels. The fovea is 0.2mm in diameter and has a resolution of 600 dots per inch - whether you&rsquo;re from Bangor or Beijing. Those two measurements, plus the reading distance and the reader&rsquo;s personal preferences or requirements, drive everything about creating readable text. They&rsquo;re all absolutes.</p>
<p>We need enough information so the browser can convert pixels (on the specific device) to absolute measurements, then take into account user preferences, too. I did a quick poll recently, and found that where average reading distance for print is 50cm, for screen reading it was clustered around 60cm - but some folks read as close as 30, others as far away as 75.</p>
<p>More evidence that a new design paradigm is needed. Today, the designer has control over the HTML and CSS. But she has no idea of the characteristics of the display on which the content will be viewed, or the reader&rsquo;s preferences (which should be honored).</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no longer an unbreakable connection between designer and display, as there was in print. And only the browser can have access to ALL the information needed to make final layout decisions. I hope that scares everyone enough to think hard about the problem.</p>
<p>BTW, Joe Clark&rsquo;s right. Critiqued as &ldquo;real-world Web pages robust enough to work anywhere&rdquo;, the pages I created are a joke. You could drive a bus through the holes in them, pick apart the execution. There are loose threads everywhere. Mea culpa, mea culpa!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care. They weren&rsquo;t built for that purpose. But I&rsquo;ve had users report they read the book on screen for a couple of hours at a stretch (and went back later for more), and I could happily read a 40-page article myself without giving up in disgust.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not an end, only a starting point. I&rsquo;m headed somewhere.</p>

John, the question, is no longer how big 13px will be, because the majority of users select from &ldquo;small' and &ldquo;medium&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t they? Point size is disappearing from the web user&rsquo;s experience, replaced by your type getting larger if you&rsquo;re &lsquo;on&rsquo; smallest and &lsquo;select&rsquo; smaller. ;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;px measurement becomes absolute at the moment something sized in px is displayed on a particular device&rdquo;
&hellip;on a particular device a pixel becomes absolute to a size once displayed! to the web page upon which it certainly must sit, it is a relative measure!</p>
<p>Bill Hill!?, the eye knows pixels or one would not need to enumerate the distances we choose from each device.</p>
<p>We have enough information from the monitors to get size back to normal, it has been there for a while. We need a font permitting table, variations and extra-contextual substitution in a standard font format (with hints interpreted or at least if non-interpreted, documented by all), compliance to this standard font format by all browsers (a standard display technique for all browsers independent of OSs &rsquo;d be nice:)). All must use @fontface. We need web authoring(?) to transition to presentation of a narrower and denser range of better-rendered text sizes to choose from (how long is this bit gonna take?), and a fruit salad with a tiny glass of ancient port on the side.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a fine day when those things are accomplished, &lsquo;cause that, and a few FB fonts, will make Hill&rsquo;s web site readable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that scares everyone enough to think hard about the problem.&rdquo;
How scared would one have to be, to repeatedly-beyond-count (2005-2008), tell one of one&rsquo;s biggest clients, that the client was full of beans?</p>
<p>Dan and John: &ldquo;I can’t stand zoom, either.&rdquo;
You obviously don&rsquo;t like Pan either then? And do neither of you carry an internet porthole on your phones?</p>
<p>Aluminum: &ldquo;if [] designing specifically for the iPhone, [then] you have a [] fixed canvas to deal with.&rdquo;
You are aware that it zooms and pans? Perhaps you mean to say, that if one is designing a non-internet app for the iPhone one may have a fixed, or a dual-fixed (port. &amp; land.) canvas to deal with? Part of this, however, is true of all displayed content everywhere if the page&rsquo;s description(s) is/are capable of reacting to the page&rsquo;s dimension(s) dynamically. But in the end, the definition of &lsquo;reacting&rsquo; is really based on how well the type composes and recomposes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only seen both zoom-happy content and dual purposed layout happening consistently with good type on the Apple Macintosh iPhone. One hope we&rsquo;ve all pointed to, and I reiterate for possible effect, is that little high res web devices get cheap fast.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>I know all You People are print designers and font designers and so on, but no amount of complaint or avoidance will change the fact that HTML marks up the structure of your content (there are rules for such markup), CSS defines its presentation, and the user has absolute control over the outcome.
