  Big Think interview in 2010. I was just wondering what people make of programmes
  like OpenType and TrueType contributing to the high number of bad typefaces available.
  Is it having a negative or positive impact of the field of type design?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks!"

    leading in.\r\n\r\nTo work backwards, you ask if having a large number of \"bad
    typefaces\" is a good or bad thing. Well, I don't know what a \"bad typeface\"
    is, but surely having more bad typefaces is self-evidently a bad thing.\r\n\r\nMoving
    further backwards, OpenType and TrueType \u2014 two quite different things \u2014
    have nothing in particular to do with a proliferation of bad typefaces; in fact,
    OpenType has made possible some extraordinary and technically complex typefaces
    of considerable merit.\r\n\r\nMoving even further backwards, everyone has always
    thought there were too many inferior typefaces. Vignelli didn't invent that. Well,
    everyone except type designers and typographers who appreciate their work.\r\n\r\nAnd
    lastly (firstly), do <em>you</em> think there are too many typefaces? Are there
    too many paintings in the world, or types of food, or performances of Shakespeare,
    or models of cars? Should we stop painting and cooking and acting and inventing
    just because we could get by with that we have already? Which is to say, what,
    after all, is the point of typography? The two questions go hand in hand."

  body: "This question, although it gets asked often, deserves to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\nBut,
    bad typefaces don't do much harm merely by <em>existing</em>.\r\n\r\nSo we can
    focus further on two questions:\r\n\r\nHas it become difficult, even for sophisticated,
    professional typeographers, to filter out quality typefaces because of the proliferation
    of bad ones?\r\n\r\nAre casual type users often going astray because of the proliferation
    of bad typefaces?\r\n\r\nIn the first case, I think the answer is no; professional
    typographers and real type designers are connecting quite well, thank you.\r\n\r\nIn
    the second case, casual type users are mostly using what came with their computer.
    In the case of Windows, that's fairly safe and standard faces, although Arial
    has come in for some criticism (never mind Comic Sans). I don't think they get
    fooled by sites like dafont; if they get ambitious, and know something about historical
    typefaces, they might pull the Bitstream collection from an old Corel product.\r\n\r\nYes,
    they wouldn't know about contemporary quality free fonts that they might use,
    say, from the League of Movable Type, for example. "

    just to publish an excellent typeface, they have to brand and market it\u2014it

    as Tom Phinney has remarked, the only fonts that are really bad are those with
    incorrect coding, missing characters, dodgy naming, poor hinting, etc.\u2014technical
    defects, not the design of the letters."
