  This is a font that I have to recreate for a logo design. I'm sure I've seen it
  before, but can't seem to place it now for the life of me.\r\n\r\nIt's very similar
  to both Stymie and Serifa Cond Black, but not quite... Bulldog Hunter is also very
  close, but no cigar...\r\n\r\nAny help? Thanks!"
