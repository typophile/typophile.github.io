The focus on ethics was there way before the Babylonian exile, and the ethical ideas from Abraham and Moses continue in Rabbinic Judaism, then subsequently Christianity and Islam. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you know some other history give me the references.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;not related to ethics at all.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually these are mainly theological, and don't have to do really with the content of ethics. In the history of Judaism, Jews only adopted the idea of resurrection at the time of Chanukah, in 165 BCE, because it was obvious that good and pious people were getting martyred rather than getting the earthly rewards promised in the Torah. So they bought the whole heaven-hell end of days &amp; resurrection package.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The influence of this is in my opinion decidedly mixed. On one hand it may have helped to push the idea that we should try to make a better world on earth - one variation on the messianic idea. On the other hand, the whole black and white way of thinking leads to fanaticism. It became Manichaeism, which influenced Christianity much more, with the idea of the Devil as an independent actor causing harm, and other ideas.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Abraham and especially Moses were already social reformers seeking a more just society, so I tend to think that the Zoroasterian influence (if it is that, as historians don't agree) is largely bad. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next post will be on topic!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's very telling that this thread has evolved into discussions over religion. I'll bet John could have predicted it would happen. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's my take: Who we choose to work for and who we'd turn away is ultimately a personal decision. For every person (or studio), it comes down to what they're comfortable with and whether they can look themselves in the mirror at the end of the day (and whether looking at themselves in the mirror is even important to them at all). It seems the real danger lies when we try to enforce our personal standards (whether based on opinion, religion, personal experience, morals or ethics) upon others.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And then there's the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->First Things First manifesto<!-- raw HTML omitted --> published in Emigre #51. As designers, we hold within our reach the power to shape the way people perceive the world around them, and it's my opinion that we ought to use our talents to try to make the world a better place. (Yes, the definition of 'better place' will vary from person to person.) The FTF manifesto suggests a move away from promoting abject consumerism of inessential products in order to focus our efforts on cultural and social change. I can get behind this, but I also recognize that I need such clientele in order to make a living and feed my family. So I choose carefully who to take on so that at a minimum, we're not aiding an organization that is negatively impacting the world. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a founder and partner in a design firm, it was important to me to align with partners who shared a similar goal, so that we may avoid conflict over selecting design opportunities that present themselves.  Has anyone out there been faced with a decision in their studios in which the partners differed over taking on a specific client?  What was the outcome?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I recognize there are plenty of designers out there who have no qualms about taking on Corporation X or Y, and could care less whether they make the world a better place&hellip; Who see no need to distinguish between clientele. It's not my place to decide what's &quot;good&quot; and who's &quot;bad&quot; so I pledge that I won't disrespect you for your choices in the event we differ - all I ask is the same courtesy. There's plenty of work out there to keep us all busy, and as Tiffany said, at least this way we won't be competing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, what's your thought on taking on Pro Bono or non-profit work?  Personally, I think it a good thing that design firms take on some work in order to help organizations that never could otherwise afford the expertise. It's also a great way to stay grounded and avoid having every design project be driven by the almighty dollar.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, what you consistently and conveniently ignore is that most people don't have the will nor the ability to consider macroeconomic issues - they're simply trying to eke out a living. They have the sense not to trust the powers that be to look after them. And they're not qualified to consider matters of state anyway (they're qualified to repair shoes or serve food), and most of them have the sense to know that. It is mostly in the West that the illusion of individual relevance to society is so strikingly enforced. Why? Because a watertight system has been built, and when you give people the illusion of power they're a lot less likely to overturn it. Voting, freedom of speech, mandatory public education of children, television, the whole thing is rigged to produce and maintain servile, oblivious peons. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What the oppressed masses of people want in this world is something very basic they don't have: being treated decently. Your system is making things worse for most people, not better. And the few that it makes things better for, it shields from a realization of its inhumanity, lest their sense of decency causes problems. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back off from destroying the world, otherwise you'll get your due in the end, one way or another. You cannot overpower Nature, including the nature of the human spirit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; And who will tell me (please) which of them is/are right? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Only one person: you. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; appreciating an individual for his/her own worth is superior to judging <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the individual based on his/her ethnic or geopolitical background.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Indeed. Discriminating against an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->individual<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is racism, which is unfair and damaging. But making observations about groups of people (for example that Armenians are more conservative than the French), and even acting on them, is not racism. In fact, it's natural, and the only way forward. Otherwise you're stuck in a relativist world where nobody is responsible for their actions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cultures create and maintain values, and these can be conducive to the health of humanity as a whole, or not. Fear of pointing out problems in certain cultures (like the American gluttony) is exactly what the system wants you to feel. And just in case you're a brave person, you'll never get your views aired in the mainstream anyway. And you can't even complain about that, because you have no Formal Proof (a requirement for credibility in western culture) of media bias (and even if you did you could never publicize it), and because anyway you have freedom of speech, right?&hellip; Anybody can say anything they want, and they feel better, reducing the chances for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->action<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Nevermind that you can only ever say it to a few hundred people at most. When you think about it, dissent is essentially undemocratic. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; nature selected them for extinction <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nature? Democracy is the most unnatural of systems. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All that is old will be new again. But of course the masses will continue the think that the dormant systems are &quot;extinct&quot;, that their society is always gradually improving (nevermind that the 20th century was the worst in humankind), that their system is the best there ever was. Why? Because people believe what you tell them, and through the media the system conveys self-aggrandizement, to maintain stability. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When you vote in the US, you're part of the problem - it's that simple. The absolute least I can do for humanity is not vote - not to go through the motions of this murderous juggernaut. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

There is a reason we have such poor voter turnout in the US. It's not apathy as much as futility. We're really not a democracy anymore (not that we technically ever were). We're really a corporate run society. We're as different as monarchy's as we maybe like to think. Our Monarch tends to be a logo rather than a person, that's all.
