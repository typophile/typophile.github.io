  body: "The Latin specimen looks like Futura as it was commonly sold at the end of
    the metal type era. Compare to the specimen in Jaspert's Type Encyclopedia, 1970:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FuturaLightSM_6602.jpg]\r\nAs
    for history, author etc, here is what Jaspert said:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FuturaInfo_6488.jpg]\r\nRenner's
    early versions had some significant differences in letter-forms, but that may
    be more info than you want at this stage.\r\nDon"

  body: "Exactly, Deberny & Peignot upon the idea of the art director Maximilien Vox
    acquired rights to produce a version of Futura from Bauer. \r\nThey released Europe
    in 1931 in France and french colonies. It seems the greek variant is specific
    to Deberny & Peignot as they produce it punchcutting while Bauer use a pantographic
    process to directly produce Futura.\r\nWe wrote a book in french about the history
    of Futura typeface. ISBN 978-2-9155-4239-4\r\n\r\n[[http://www.editions-norma.com/Livres/Arts-decoratifs-l-Design/Futura-une-gloire-typographique]]\r\n[[www.facebook.com/futurastory]]\r\n\r\n"
