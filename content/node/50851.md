  is a social investment/development project in Africa. Here: http://youturn.jesperlarsen.com/
  you can read more about it as well as see an earlier version of the logo and the
  website in development.\r\nI went for a system here that could be adapted to as
  many surfaces and formats as possible.\r\nA few words would be kindly appreciated.\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/YT_Test_4702.jpg]"

  body: I think people will have difficulty reading "turn" to be honest. It took me
    several tries before I figured it out. And then after figuring it out, it unfortunately
    didn't have that "oh that's clever!" moment. It was more of a, "now why did they
    do that?" Why not make the "turn" text fall vertically? Why have the entire "turn"
    reversed? That would make the effect more subtle and I think improve the readability.
    I understand the concept of a u-turn that's involved here but I think readability
    would be more important then keeping the concept "pure". Also the look and feel
    of the design is very "industrial" to be honest. I'm not sure about the dot before
    the "you." Does it have meaning? Because I'm not figuring that out. That's my
    2 cents.

  body: "Thank you for the comments.\r\nI see what you mean bout the legibility. However,
    i believe that recognition is worth concidering as well. I believe that after
    a period that will not be an issue.\r\nOne of the thoughts behind the project
    is that something different has to be done in Africa, that is investment wise.
    New dirrections for successfull investment and development are needed. I have
    tried to create a mark which one would have to look at differetly in order to
    decode it. I dont know if that is too overdone maybe?? Or perhaps just futile.\r\nThe
    fullstop was an attempt to balance out the overall feel of the mark, but i guess
    it wont be necessary.\r\nI am working on alternatives at the moment. Here is one.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/YT_Test_02_6236.jpg]"

  body: "I actually really like it. The only thing that confuses me is the period
    before YOU. I didn't have an issue reading TURN at all. I'm not completely sold
    on the slash/line/diagonal thing between the words though. What is it for? \r\n\r\nI
    can tell that you know this, but I love the way the mark resembles the shape of
    Africa.\r\n\r\n-S"

  body: at first glance I really like the design...especially on the letterhead &
    the vehicles. Than, I notice the logo is leading the eye downward...it's not a
    good thing especially if you believe in Feng shui. It might be irrelevance to
    you though...but just saying.

  body: "Thanks Jakes\r\nYou\xB4re right, no relevance at all.\r\nGuess we have to
    change western reading direction also, that is acording to Feng Shui, as that
    leads the eye downwards as well :-) "

    postings that the word "Turn" should be turned rather than flipped. The slash
    was also a puzzlement although I see it was removed in your latest posting. '

  body: "I was going to write and say that I think the \"turn\" being backwards is
    ok. Then I changed my mind. I understand what you're saying about it not being
    a problem once you establish brand recognition, but I don't think it's necessary
    for that. Your logo is already unique in the way the two lines of text come together.
    There's not many logos out there with vertical type. I like your most recent version
    the best with \"turn\" knocked out, it really grabs attention. i also prefer it
    without the period. It only adds confusion because it makes it seem like that's
    the end point and i keep trying to read it backwards, especially with the turn
    flipped like that. there doesn't seem to be a point (pun!).\r\n\r\nI also like
    the logo on top of africa, i could definitely see it printed on a tee. But I wouldn't
    use africa as part of the logo. it works well as a secondary element as you're
    using it now.\r\n\r\nthe only other thing that bothers me a bit is that i keep
    thinking u-turn, i saw the arrows on your site and i can see that this plays into
    it a lot. but the logo isn't really making the shape of a u-turn. more of an L.
    I'm guessing your intention of turning the text like that was to play on the u-turn.
    it's just not there yet for me...although it still is very eye appealing and maybe
    doesn't need to be that obvious either. "

  body: "This is much more \"readable\" design. I'm still not understanding the period
    though. It doesn't seem to fit -what's your reasoning behind the period? Another
    thought - although this could be getting a tad too clich\xE9 - but what if you
    actually had a bent arrow symbol (like they actually use on u-turn signs) between
    the \"you\" and the \"turn\"? Finally, what if you stylized the African continent
    artwork - make it look like it was drawn freehand? This might help give it a more
    friendly feeling."
