  similar would be appreciated as well.\r\n\r\nhttp://flyerscoupons.ca/attachments/zellers/76d1267552597-coupon-tresemme-booklet-found-2-new-coupons-pic-included-tresemme-coupons.jpg\r\n\r\nThis
  coupon is the best example I could find that uses the font a lot.\r\n\r\nHere is
  the old logo, in case you are curious.\r\nhttp://www.hairstraightenershop.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Tresemme-logo.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks!"
