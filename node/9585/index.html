Though our first &quot;Fancy Lads Design Club&quot; is very amusing, we felt we made need to be a bit less sarcastic and more professional. <BR> <BR>So this is our follow-up. Gestalting. We are subversively mocking the English language and it making any word a verb and the our own profession in a way. Though I know it is gestalten &quot;to give shape or form&quot; in German, the english definition of &quot;gestalt&quot; is sort of boggling when it is so simple in German. <BR> <BR>&quot;an organized whole that is perceived as more than the sum of its parts.&quot; <BR> <BR>Here is another interesting summation: <BR> <BR>This 'gestalt', or 'whole form' approach sought to isolate principles of perception; seemingly innate mental 'laws', which determined the way in which objects were perceived. <BR> <BR>So what we took from it was the idea of that the whole is greater when the pieces work together. <BR> <BR>I know the one looks like a Cingular-conjoined twin! <BR> <BR>And i have also unintentionally created something within the mark by fulfilling the whole. Does that make any sense? <BR> <BR>Give me some thoughts on color, shape, placement and other things you see or don't see. <BR> <BR>jp</div>

Though I would like to get some thoughts about it vitality and whether its something that has promise and can stand out by name and the mark as a whole. <BR> <BR>I'll wait to open the can of worms later. Feedback is needed and appreciated. <BR> <BR>Oh and if the semi-bold part looks funny(since you all have great eyes), its because I redrew it until I feel confident enough to invest the money in the full character set. <BR> <BR>jp</div>
