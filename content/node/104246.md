body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am wondering what font is used in the book \"A Streetcar Named
  Desire\"--specifically the script and stage directions. A photo is attached (screencap
  from Amazon). More samples can be found at the Amazon look inside preview. The ISBN
  is 978-0-8112-1602-9.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nTom"

    for regular and <em>italic</em>, which makes no sense to me.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the help!!"
