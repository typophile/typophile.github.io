body: Though I feel this is slightly off-topic, I just wondered whether any of the
  logos here are any good. The most recent is to the far right, used at my site www.become.uk.
  The older logos are to the left, with the inspiration, the lc &#39;b&#39; of the
  font Cosmos0, on the far left. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1197.gif"

    vessel -- fill it up with great branding and you have a great logo. Fill it up
    with bad branding or no branding and you have a bad logo. <BR> <BR>One might as
    well want to know the concept behind the Nike swoosh. It&#39;s one of the most
    recognizable symbols in the world and it&#39;s just a curved line. '

  body: ' I absolutely disagree with John . . . <BR> <BR>A peice of art can be good
    and not have a concept. An amazing peice of art is a good peice of art with a
    concept. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen poorly executed art that with a concept that is
    far better than exceptionally executed art with little or no concept. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    impossible to have a great brand without some purpose to it even if it&#39;s minimal.
    Brands and logos stem from something more than &#34;becuase it just appeals to
    me&#34; else they fail miserably as a platform to expand the identity of a company.
    <BR> <BR>And how could you possibly market a company based on nothing more than
    a look without a purpose? <BR> <BR>Stuart :D '

  body: ' A good logo must work in black and white. It would be nice to see your new
    logo just in black and white. As for your colour combinations they are really
    nice and current.  Orange means very little symbolically &#40;this can be a good
    thing or a bad thing&#41; and is very popular these days. I think it will stick
    around for 2 years more before it becomes pass&eacute;. Kudos for not doing any
    glow or bevel effect. '

    recently took a job for a non-profit lit/arts journal here in Minneapolis. I was
    given the prospectus to review, and it seemed like it would be a really fun job.
    The magazine made it seem like a real cutting-edge, modern, no holds barred, breaking
    all the rules publication. I was all set to start planning this really modern
    looking site, and you can imagine my disappointment when i received this: <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Maybe it&#39;s just me, but Apple Chancery just doesn&#39;t do the great
    idea of this wonderful magazine justice. And what is the purpose of that rounded
    square, you ask. I asked the designer the same thing. The answer I got was &#34;well,
    I think it looks nice, and the calligraphic type is representative of &#39;writing&#39;.&#34;   <BR>
    <BR>I offered to create something, for free even, but the editors thought it was
    too late. It&#39;s really too bad.'
