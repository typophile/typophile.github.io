body: Back in 1997 I went to London and checked out the St. Martin&#39;s Academy Of
  Art College. I picked up a gorgeous brochure &#40;which I later lent to one of those
  people that do not return books&#41;. <BR>The brochure had text set in custom fonts
  by Phil Baines as well as Barnbrook&#39;s Manson &#40; later renamed Mason &#41;,
  and also some student typefaces. Phils work was very innovative and I was hoping
  someone knew where to get his faces or at least view them. As I recall the &#34;A&#34;
  and &#34;e&#34; looked something like this. The only font I have seen anywhere is
  &#34;Can you&#34; from Fontshop / Fuse. <BR> <BR> <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/847.jpg"
