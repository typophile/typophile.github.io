  its hand drawn) in this logo for the San Francisco Municipal Railway?\r\n\r\nThanks.

  body: "It most certainly is hand drawn. \r\nIf an existing typeface was the model,
    someone could come up with a match.\r\nIn the meantime, looking for \u201Crailway\u201D
    at MyFonts, brings some interesting results.\r\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Western
    Railway (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/western-railway/) has a similar
    flavour to the words (it needs some condensing for \u201CMunicipal\u201D), while
    something from Greater Albion Typefounders (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/birmingham-new-street/
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/great-bromwich/) could give you the |F|."

  body: Some of the serifs, and especially the |A|s have a Latin shape (http://www.myfonts.com/search/latin/),
    which, I think, make them optically better suited to be placed on an arc.
