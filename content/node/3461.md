body: Ok, everyone &#42;has&#42; to go to the link that&#39;s on the startup page,
  mentioned as winning in the flash contest for type. There&#39;s a section called
  historic tale-construction kit, and although mine is messed up &#40;I didn&#39;t
  realize the story could have pages!&#41; the other entries in the gallery are pretty
  funny, my favorite being the one about some bird&#39;s prophecy for a king. I think
  I might develop a story and resubmit something...
