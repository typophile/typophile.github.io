  This typeface ( if it's not custom ) ... \r\n\r\nIt's an OLD STYLE Serif face, with
  a calligraphic flair and hand-scribed feel. ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ?\r\n\r\nLooking
  for this exact Face or something similar :) \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance ! \r\n\r\nlex\r\n\r\n\u2020\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Blowing_3552.gif]"

    looking for an exact match.\r\nDon"

    If that's true, this is very well-drawn lettering, and not a font.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "You might be right Mike, I can't spot the difference but the scale of the
    image is small so it might be there. I note that a an exactly matching font has
    not been found by now. I infer from this that it might not exist, at least in
    a version available to the public.\r\nPerhaps the best way to get a matching digital
    set of capitals would be to have a calligrapher hand letter them and scan the
    set for making a font or for vector outlines to use in Illustrator. The missing
    letters would not seem to be a major problem. The letter-forms in Fondamento could
    be adapted to this variation of Foundational Hand.\r\nDon"
