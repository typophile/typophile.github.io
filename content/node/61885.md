body: "Hi folks\r\n\r\nWe're piloting a new sports nutrition range.\r\n\r\nThe product
  is innovative and technical and we're aiming to appeal to serious athletes rather
  than macho muscle-heads. \r\n\r\nSo the image we're after is clean, scientific,
  upmarket and dynamic/masculine. The brand is quite design led - we're aiming to
  be the \"Apple\" of our marketplace.\r\n\r\nWe're looking for a font that's cutting-edge
  and distinctive, but legible at relatively small sizes for labelling. To get the
  dynamic feel, we've mainly been focusing on Italic Slab Serif, but perhaps we're
  on the wrong track?\r\n\r\nWe're really struggling to find anything suitable. We've
  done a lot of digging around on the mainstream font sites, so we're hoping you guys
  might know of something we might have overlooked - perhaps something in a small
  font-house or the public domain?\r\n\r\nAny help with this would be much appreciated!"

  body: "Hi dberlow\r\n\r\nInteresting suggestion. Perhaps a bit \"industrial\" for
    something you're going to be putting into your body? And feels a touch retro too.
    This squares with the designer's statement that his inspiration was \"architectural
    geometry of cast iron and brickwork in nineteenth- century American cityscape\".\r\n\r\nDefinitely
    on the right lines though!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I ran across something really different the other day that is very clean
    and distinctive. It doesn't fit the italic slab serif specification but boy is
    it dynamic.\r\n\r\nFeisar from Type Invaders\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Feisar_5868.gif]\r\nhttp://www.type-invaders.com/feisar/\r\n\r\n\"Feisar
    strikes a balance between two worlds. From a superficial point of view it\u2019s
    a modern display typeface, but at closer inspection the construction and spacing
    reveal the influences of traditional type design. This makes Feisar instantly
    recognizable, but still very readable at smaller sizes as well.\"\r\n\r\nFor an

    won't work but had to throw out a curve ball that has completely captivated my
    imagination for finding a way to use this in a project. ;)"

    a bit too angular and extreme for this project?\r\n\r\nI could see it working
    for an edgy dance-club, or a band, or a game?\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion\r\n\r\nGeoff"

    to put into your clients.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
