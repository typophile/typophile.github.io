  on it, I get lots of issues. Sometimes the file does not save sometimes the glyph
  name error is displayed as its more that 32 chars. \r\n\r\nI want to create it from
  the scratch. I need to copy around 30000 glyphs from one sfd file to another. How
  do I do that? Any script?\r\n\r\nThe font I am working on is Arabic Unicode Font.\r\n\r\nI
  am using Windows 7 64 bit and new to FontForge.\r\n\r\nThanks and regards,\r\nShahid"

    font formats do not support more than 64K glyphs in a font. You have hit a hard
    limit.\r\n\r\nRather than copy/paste, you could duplicate the SFD file, and then
    delete unneeded glyphs. That way you could be sure not to lose any metadata or
    interglyph info such as kerning...."

  body: "This is what I want to achieve:\r\nI am working on The Holy Book of Quran.
    In India it has a specific style and format. The text in Black in the link below
    is what I want to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe text in red is the actual Unicode Arabic
    font and the words in black  text is saved as glyphs. Each word in its own glyph.
    What I want to do is that when I type the word in Unicode Arabic font, corresponding
    glyph in black should be displayed. There are approx. 20000 such glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe
    current font has more that 65535 glyphs so I wanted to reduce it to 65535. Is
    there any way to do that.\r\nI will write the lookup data for 20000 glyphs again.
    Can I share Unicode space of some other language and copy the glyphs in that location.
    I will share some codepoints frm Private area some from Bengali, Devnagari and
    some other scripts to cover 20000 approx. glyphs.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/l/g9fsy9QSMB6CsXZ2ejyLFe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You don't need 20000+ glyphs to display the Quran text correctly, you just
    need a font with appropriate layout technology to handly dynamic letter joining
    and mark positioning. See, for example, Muhammad Zuhair's impressive <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/93945\">Albazi
    Naskh</a> font (Pakistan).\r\n\r\nEven if you do go the route of large numbers
    of word ligature glyphs, you do not need to encode these glyphs, and definitely
    should not hijack Unicode character codes from other languages and scripts to
    do so.\r\n\r\nI recommend that before you do any work on this project you properly
    research OpenType Layout and how it works.\r\n\r\n[You might also be interested
    to research DecoType's Arabic script layout technology, which although not as
    widely supported as OpenType is more powerful and better suited to Arabic script.
    DecoType are able to accurately display Quran text with fonts that contain only
    a few hundred glyphs.]"

  body: "Ok thanks. I will try to do that. As I am new to Font Development it might
    take some time. I have already started copying individual glyphs to the new one.\r\n\r\nThere
    is one thing which I did not understand when i was working on the above mentioned
    font.\r\nIn the font which I was trying to edit some of the glyphs are not displaying
    in other applications (specially Quran Publisher) but shows up perfectly in Word
    2007. Actually there was no lookups defined for it so i renamed the glyph and
    added a lookup in FontForge. Am I missing something? D I have to click on \"Unlink
    Reference\". If my lookups are wrong then it should not work in Word also!! Any
    guess or ideas??\r\n\r\nThanks"
