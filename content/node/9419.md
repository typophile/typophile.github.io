body: Can anyone suggest a beautiful yet affordable sans serif for my cv and letterhead
  design? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a graphic design student wanting a gorgeous cv,  clean
  swiss type so far...but its missing a typeface, din isn&#39;t quite doing it for
  me. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got a decent catalogue of fonts, so it would be ideal if it
  was something I had and didn&#39;t know it!

  body: Address is spelled incorrectly in your CV. Also e-mail is easier to read with
    a hyphen. And... at least in the U.S. it is customary to list your education after
    your work experience.  <BR> <BR>Forest for the trees

  body: Be consistent; use &#39;2004&#39; or &#39;04&#39;, but not both. List your
    freelance clients; if I was using this CV to judge you, I&#39;d be more interested
    in those than in the short placements. <BR>&#39;We designed adverts for printing&#39;
    doesn&#39;t really cut it to be honest...why else would you design them? <BR>Who
    says &#39;one 17 AD&#39; are &#39;reputable&#39;? - don&#39;t put subjectivity
    like this into a CV. <BR>Sorry if this seems a bit critical, but what you write
    in a CV &#40;I write as someone who has to read them for recruitment&#41; is more
    important than whether you&#39;re using DIN or not.
