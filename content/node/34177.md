  a big project as it has Serif and Sans. \r\n\r\nWhat do others feel about it?\r\n\r\nAlso
  any views on using Zine Sans and Serif for a large project, corporate brochures
  and annual reports?\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers"

    hate working with it. There's something fishy about the font files, maybe I've
    got an old version.\r\n\r\nFor instance, look at the size of the cursor in Illustrator:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/krautwald/524776957/"

  body: "That might be worth looking into. A decent OpenType version of Charlotte
    should solve my problems.\r\n\r\n<em>edit</em>\r\nThe ITC OT edition seems to
    be a few weights short of the old Letraset Charlotte family."

    always wonder whether you should stick with something tried and tested.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a very warm font.\r\n\r\nHaven't seen the cursor issue with this. I am on MAC.\r\n\r\nAnything
    on Zine then?"

  body: "I haven't used Charlotte, but the Zine family has a few annoying quirks,
    particularly in the serif version. This is a subjective view, of course.\r\n\r\nIn
    general, I try to stay away from using both sides of a sans/serif familiy together.
    It always seems like a safe and somewhat boring choice. Having said that, though,
    there are a number of other great faces in this camp:\r\n\r\nSmeijers' Quadraat\r\nMajoor's
    Scala, Seria, and Nexus\r\nChester's Apex\r\nStorm's Sebastian/Serapion\r\n\r\nIf
    you're into the work of Ole Sch\xE4fer, you might also consider using FF Fago
    (or Info) as the sans, and finding a contrasting serif to pair."

    and Serapion. Will check those out.\r\n\r\nYes Zine does seem to be a quirky old
    font but I do like it. Might be hard ot work with though."
