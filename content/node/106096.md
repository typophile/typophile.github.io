  body: "Can't find a font that could match both letters and treatment. This looks
    like a [[http://www.myfonts/search/copperplate|Copperplate]]-like with stripped
    shadow applied.  Actually, don't know any Copperplate-like this one. May be they
    started from a sans, added those tiny flare serifs, duplicated back the lettering
    and \"filled\" it with oblique stripped grid symbol.\r\nClean sans: [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview|Gotham

  body: "This form of shading was an innovation by John M. Wehrle in 1868, when\r\nhe
    engraved a type series first known as Ray Shaded.  George Bruce's\r\nSon & Co.
    sold it as \"Ornamented No. 1552.\"\r\nAccording to William Loy: \"It enabled
    the skilful compositor to rival\r\nthe productions of the lithographer, a position
    which he held until\r\nrecent years. Ray Shaded was such a decided novelty in
    type that every\r\nprinting-office making any pretenses to the better class of
    work put\r\nit in and used it until it was worn out. ... The design is a plain\r\nroman
    character, slightly condensed, with a carefully cut ray shade on\r\nthe right.\"\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ShadeUsingDiagonalLinesByJohnWehrle1868SM_5592.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PageB_NameSetInRayShadedSM_4905.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks Don, very interesting! As sidenote and to be exact, the 2 shade effects
    described above are different. The one on the sample is a underneath shifted oblique
    striped duplicated layer and the one described by Don is rather an isometric 3D
    striped effect.
