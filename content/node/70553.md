    a font. You must be proud.

  body: "For what it's worth, my jaw dropped when I saw this too. I know this kind
    of imagery isn't offensive world-wide (the Japanese still find blackface harmlessly
    amusing, for example), but in the US it's completely verboten.\r\n\r\nThe closest
    European parallel would probably be Nazi imagery.\r\n"

    not done in a racist way, so why read into it as racism?\r\n\r\nI mean, maybe
    Tomi from Suomi is actually a racist, in which case, oh shit, this is just wrong.

    rather start wondering if there\u2019s a direct link from quantity to quality
    even in type design\u2026"

    and \"Zwarte Piet\" in Holland. \"Perspective\" vs. cultural norm aside...as long
    as you are promoting/selling online, your customers are international and you
    would be wise to consider how others perceive this.\r\n"

  body: "My apologizes to everyone who found my advert offencive. My intention was
    not to make any racist comment, I just made a cartoony image to work with the
    name of the font. I've already sent new graphics to replace those that offended
    people.\r\n\r\nFinland, and most of Scandinavia (the Danes dabbled with that first
    part, I think) has no history of  colonialism or slavery, so this kind of imagery
    is not considered \"blatantly racist\". But because this is international community,
    I should have considered the audience, and I failed to do that.\r\n\r\nTherefore,
    I'm sorry.\r\n\r\nBut I do find this political correctness somewhat off-putting.
    I made \"Taffee\", not a negro (or what is a correct word?). He just happened
    to be black, because I made black background for the headline, and needed a graphic
    to fill the space. Taffee came from that.\r\n\r\nBut once again, I apologize."
