  platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac/Mobile)? Who puts extra care into their webfonts?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI
  realise this is subjective, and there are browser samples available on most services.
  However, I am after real world / behind the scenes insight if possible. \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

  body: The sprungmarker.de web site has [[http://sprungmarker.de/wp-content/uploads/webfont-services/|this]]
    overview of the major web fonts hosting services. It does not contain the exact
    information you are looking for but could be a good starting point.

  body: That's a tall order. "All platforms" also includes all applications, rendering
    engines, color selection, and video driving software within those platforms, all
    technologies used for display devices, and even completely uncontrollable factors
    such as ambient lighting.  I think that the quest for the holy grail would be
    simpler!

      mobile. I only use Apple/iOS devices with any degree of regularity \u2013 I
      don't have the experience to know what webfonts perform well on other platforms.
      I am sure not all webfonts are created equal...\r\n\r\n "

  body: "AFAIK, \"Webfonts\"  are standard fonts that have been made accessible/usable
    by web pages without users' ability to store/save/copy/pirate them. Some have
    been converted to other formats (e.g., EOT) to achieve that purpose.  General
    use is still in its infancy. \r\n\r\nhttp://webfonts.myfonts.com/webfonts-know-how/what-are-webfonts-0\r\n\r\nYour
    response doesn't affect my comments; browsers are just a subset of \"applications\".
    And where is the line (if there is a line) between 'webfonts' and e-reader fonts?
    If there is one, it won't last very long.\r\n\r\n"
