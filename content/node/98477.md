body: "Bruno is an innovative multi-layered font which I developed at the KHB (University
  of Arts Berlin) under the guidance of Luc(as) de Groot. \r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8DKqp.jpg\"
  alt=\"\" />\r\nIt's basic form principle is that of a ribbon, folded and bent in
  space to produce the glyphs. I named it after my grandfather who was a poster designer
  and thus hand drew a lot of custom fonts.\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hPwtP.jpg\"
  alt=\"\" />\r\nTraditionally the use of multi-layered fonts can be very clumsy,
  since you often need to duplicate text fields and then align them precisely on top
  of each other. Not so with Bruno: I programmed an InDesign plugin for it that automates
  the whole progress. There's a one minute demo video here: https://vimeo.com/54004048\r\n\r\nThe
  font contains all necessary glyphs to display eastern, middle, and west european
  languages.\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3t3K1.jpg\"  alt=\"\" />"

  body: "Nice work! You can get some really neat contrasts with the double colors.
    \r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a typeface with layering as well. It's a pity
    Adobe scripts are still a bit crummy to implement, that's what they can get away
    with sadly as market-leader. I have to go with ID/Illustrator scripts as well
    but I'd rather have something simpler.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks all!\r\n\r\n@hrant\r\nIt got much easier in the last years, but more
    than half of my code ist stuff that works around a lot annoying InDesign bugs.
    Finding these & finding a fix is usually a PITA\r\n\r\n@Nick\r\nThe plugin copies
    the textframe and activates a special OT feature on that copied frame. If anything
    is changed on the original textframe (content, position etc.) it's mirrored to
    the copy.\r\n\r\n@Grant\r\nUnfortunately Adobe trademarked my grandfathers name,
    so MyFonts took the font down. I'll now have to come up with another name. It's
    still available to buy at leo-koppelkamm.de/bruno\r\n\r\n\r\nLeo"
