  body: "I never like curtailing speculation, but it's probably high time already:\r\nIt
    sort of has to do with chirography, in that this is about Arabic, and Arabic is
    conservative that way. But chirography per se is actually circumstantial here.
    Basically this query stems from an idea I got from Onur Yaz\u0131c\u0131gil's
    presentation at the New Orleans TypeCon*, an idea that I elaborated in my ISType
    talk** in June: in order to express the glorious Arabic past of Turkish writing
    (something admittedly not all Turks are crazy about, but I think it's a key way
    of defending Turkish culture in a Western world) a nice subtle trick would be
    to make the tittles diamond-shaped. This would also extend to giving any Latin
    setting a gentle Arabic vibe.\r\n\r\n* http://onuredy.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/hello-world/\r\n\r\n**
    http://www.istype.com/?p=776\r\n\r\nDuring my talk I showed the following image
    that proposes a quick mod to Carter Sans Italic for setting Turkish:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cartersans2_6096.gif]\r\nQuite
    contrary to the view of some Turks that evoking Arabic would be backwards, my
    view is that doing it subtly would in fact be... sophisticated.\r\n\r\nBTW one
    \"cosmic\" thing that happened in Istanbul was that <em>immediately</em> after
    my talk Fred Smeijers started his own presentation and he was using Meran for
    the text!  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I'm sorry, Hrant, but you are making something out of nothing, and I thought
    this during your ISType presentation too. Yes, of course the presence or absence
    of dot in Turkish matters, but its shape doesn't, and Turkish text looks like
    Turkish text to the people who matter, Turkish readers, without a design feature
    that is at once too subtle to be significant and too nostalgically suggestive
    of something for which there is no nostalgia. It's ironic that your demonstration
    word is 'sophisticated', since the result looks so naff.

    there's nothing better for cultural progress than public challenge.\r\n\r\nI admit
    that comparing the shape of the dot to no dot at all isn't entirely fair. But
    the shape does matter:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>too subtle to be significant</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis
    is frankly surprising to hear from a text face designer. Maybe I've misunderstood
    this aspect of your approach to type design all these years.\r\n\r\nAnd how could
    it be \"naff\" if it's too subtle?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>for which there is no nostalgia.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    hate nostalgia. It's not my intent to leverage such a base emotion.* My angle
    is cultural preservation, especially in the context of possible admission into
    the European Union. And anybody who thinks Arabic has no relevance to Turkish
    culture is simply fooling himself. Walking around Istanbul completely confirmed
    this for me. I sent Alessandro some photos showing how engrained Arabic remains
    to Turks (for publication in his \"mini interview\" thing) but I won't show them
    here lest I steal his thunder. Calling the influence \"decorative\" is a convenient
    superficial escape.\r\n\r\n* Although I do think that Turks who lean more towards
    Islam are more likely to yearn for the \"good old days\". And remember that -at
    least among some Muslims- the Qur'aan is only \"official\" in Arabic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    it is significant in formal terms, but as a single detail it is too insignificant
    to carry the weight of cultural implications that you want to load on it. I think
    there is often an odd disconnect between the grandness of your ideas and a kind
    of timidity in their application.\r\n\r\nAs for naff, I was referring to your
    Carter Sans illustration. At that size, the dots are far from subtle.\r\n\r\nI
    too saw the large amount of Ottoman building lettering in in Arabic script in
    Istanbul (and also purchased a book on the subject that I have given to Tom Milo),
    but other than representing an official policy to preserve historical record I
    didn't see any indication that the script is important for modern Turks <em>who
    cannot read it.</em> I wouldn't even call the influence of these artefacts 'decorative';
    I don't think there is an influence. I saw huge amounts of modern Turkish signage,
    and no trace of any connection to the older Ottoman cartouches."

    of interest to some Filipinos who can't read it.\r\n\r\nAlso, the overwhelming
    majority of Turks are Sunni Muslims, and I think this means that the Quran is
    only 'official' in Arabic for <em>them</em> - thus, while Turkey has mass literacy
    in the Latin script for the Turkish language, I would expect Arabic literacy to
    still be widespread in that country.\r\n\r\nEven Muslim clergy of liberal political
    inclinations would need to engage in Quranic scholarship - in order to defend
    their positions.\r\n\r\n@hrant:\r\nI know this <em>should</em> go in an E-mail
    or something...\r\n\r\nI see you've designed an Armenian-language keyboard layout,
    based on traditional typewriter layouts. I happen to have [[http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/kybint.htm|some
    familiarity]] with what has been done with typewriter layouts in the past, and
    thus I have the temerity to make some suggestions for improvement:\r\n\r\n1) As
    you must resort to a third shift for the digits, due to the number of letters
    in Armenian, there is no good reason to keep them on the top row. As some Katakana
    layouts [[http://www.quadibloc.com/comp/images/kbkana.gif|have done (image link)]],
    you should place them on the home row (ASDFGHJKL;).\r\n\r\n2) Also, as this gives
    the AltGr third shift a very high degree of prominence in the Armenian keyboard,
    as opposed to keyboards like Canadian French or Brazilian Portuguese, where it
    is simply used for less-common accented letters or additional special characters
    and punctuation, you should offer the option of a reassignment of certain additional
    keys on the keyboard:\r\n\r\nLeft and right Ctrl keys -> AltGr\r\nCaps Lock key
    -> Ctrl\r\nRight Alt key -> Caps Lock\r\n\r\nFor those who prefer to keep Caps
    Lock where it is, just moving the Ctrl key to the right Alt key could be another
    option.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I <em>have</em> sent an E-mail now about this to the appropriate
    party, Michael Everson."
