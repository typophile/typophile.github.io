  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am coming to this forum of what I consider font experts in hopes of reviving an old discussion. Years back I posted this &hellip;
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/5563">http://typophile.com/node/5563</a>
to the forum and frankly I have not had to deal with font issues for a while but recently an old client asked me to come in and install a new 27&quot;iMac.</p>
<p>Problem is their old workstation and files have been touched by numerous users who all have different ideas of how to manage fonts and there are multiple copies of numerous fonts and at least three different font managers, Apples Fontbook, Fontexplorer, Suitcase, you name it.</p>
<p>They want auto activation, the current user has no leaning toward any one tool and does not seem inclined to tackle the issue of wading through multiple copies and organization, so it is up to me. I am re reading the Extensis &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; doc and this one I found googling. 
<a href="http://www.jklstudios.com/misc/osxfonts.html">http://www.jklstudios.com/misc/osxfonts.html</a></p>
<p>I am seeking info on what you all think is the best way to cleanup and organize for starters then what management tool to use. My gut feel is to gather the fonts (minus system) use Font Doctor to clean and then use a management tool. What are yours?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You could look into a server based/browser based manager. That would allow users to still have system and some application fonts on their computers, but the main collection is all on one server. You can create specific user groups, manage licenses, etc.</p>
<p>When I worked for a large studio we used Font Reserve (that had problems) and then switched to Universal Type Server (UTS) by Extensis. UTS seemed to perform well once you got used to it. Fonts with limited seat licenses can be restricted to specific groups. Font Reserve, also by Extensis,  I had problems with and wouldn&rsquo;t personally recommend.</p>
<p>For myself at home I use Font Explorer also.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Be careful with Font Doctor and all those fonts. An Extensis rep came to my former workplace and did a font migration of our Font Reserve server to a new one dedicated to UTS using Font Doctor. It was a complete disaster.</p>
<p>As a preface I should mention a big problem Font Reserve had. Font Reserve would allow users to manage fonts on their own computers as it well should. Only problem was it was also copying these fonts onto the server. I was not managing fonts when that was all set up, but started about the time we got UTS. So when I went to go through the new migrated collection instead of a couple thousand fonts there were close to 10.000. More than half were unlicensed fonts pulled from users computers that were either corrupt or PS orphans. Font Doctor also merged versions of fonts with the same family name even if they were from different sources. I spent way too much time fixing that mess. The only good out of all of that was I got a large studio to finally pay attention to licensing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks all, the more I read the more I think many of the issues are because they went to a new Mac that has to use 10.6., there are some font conflicts with OS 10.6. Mainly Helvetica, Helvetica Neue and some others.</p>
<p>has anyone read the two docs I mentioned? I am impressed with both but Kurt Lang&rsquo;s writeup is fairly new and complete, I am going to read it a second time today.</p>
<p>Stephen, This is a one graphic person shop so a font server is not needed, you FontDoctor story is scary but plan is to clone the users Mac with either Carbon Copy Cloner or Super Duper, clone their OS to another Mac and figure out the issues there first so I am not too worried.</p>
<p>JamesM and Fontrasin, if you made me choose today I would go with Fontexplorerx, in fact they own that as well as Suitcase which I made them them stop using and move to Fontexplorerx a few years ago because of issues but I hear it has improved.</p>
<p>Tell thanks for the tip on FontCase, I love the company name! I googled it, reviews are good and a lot of people like it but auto activation was a big issue for him until recently. Also perhaps the biggest drawback is it appears they are a one man shop. The comments on the reviews keep pointing me back to Fontexplorerx.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Bohemian Coding
Although I use the plural everywhere when I talk about Bohemian Coding, there&rsquo;s only one person in this company. Bohemian Coding was founded early 2008 in the Netherlands and is being run by Pieter Omvlee. We develop a number of great (at least in our opinion) shareware applications for Mac OS X and have many things planned for the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babs, stay tuned&hellip;..</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>re FontCase: Although the program has been a one-person endeavor it has the backing of FontShop International nowadays (they assisted with the plug-ins if I recall correctly).</p>
<p>My program of choice is FontAgentPro, which is simple yet powerful and well maintained by the developer (example in case: they are quite forward with putting out new versions of plug-ins for new CS-versions, which counts in my view as a major plus). For a single person shop it is just the thing, imo.</p>
<p>My tip for your friend/client: Backup all the font files onto a external drive. Erase from the main computer. Install just the necessary ones and the ones that come with Adobe apps. Search and install fonts as and when needed, preferably OS-format. And always test before giving newly installed fonts the right to live on.</p>
<p>I did the same a couple of years ago and it&rsquo;s been plain sailing ever since… : )</p>
<p>(I also have tried FontDoctor to sort out things, but it is — or was — quite finicky about certain characteristics which I never could place in context; maybe a misplaced byte by a font designer or such… The result: loads of font files classified as Reject/Repair and such, blah!)</p>
