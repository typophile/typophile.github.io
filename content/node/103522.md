  design course, and I'm doing the final graphic project. For my project, I must develop
  a new fashion brand and for this brand I need make a visual identity. Well, to do

  be Swiss 721 family a good font for impression and graphics stuffs?? And if someone

  body: Swiss 721 is as the name more or less states a copy of Helvetica. Bitstream
    published it after not getting a license for the original. So why do you not use
    Helvetica?

  body: 'Swiss 721 is a very clear face that will be excellent for an identity system
    that calls for something as clean and legible as possible while having more font
    variations than Helvetica. As far as history goes, to the best of my knowledge
    it is a basic variation of Helvetica (very similar to Helvetica Neue) created
    by Bitstream sometime in the last 30 years. '

  body: Hrant, look after yourself by wishing a thing like that. Before you know you
    are using only Helvetica like Neville Brody did after his wild years at The Face.

  body: If you lay Swiss 721 on top of Helvetica and compare outlines - except for
    a slightly different arc in the leg in the 'R' there is no virtually difference
    whatsoever. I think the figures may be slightly taller or shorter.

  body: Swiss 721 has more logical weight/width distibution compared to the original
    Helvetica. This makes it more useful for starters...
