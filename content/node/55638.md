    placement and shape of the tail seems arbitrary. A loop might work, or maybe look
    at the \"B\" for guidance and have the tail grow out of the left side of the bowl?
    (Not sure this would work.)\r\n\r\nThe \"C\" has an underbite to my eyes. May
    also be a bit wide (and I agree with Craig that it's short, as well as the \"G\").\r\n\r\nI
    think the \"H\" may need to be wider.\r\n\r\nOne thing that strikes me as odd
    about the \"J\" (other than the left side of the curve, which somehow doesn't
    work) is the long left-side head serif. All your other horizontal serifs seem
    to be shorter (even on the \"F\", which might benefit from a longer one on the
    right), so I'm wondering why you're making an exception here.\r\n\r\nI think the
    shape of the \"U\" is somewhat amiable! But you may want to work out the inner
    vs. outer curves a bit more smoothly where the curve grows out of the stem on
    the left side.\r\n\r\nIs this going to have lowercase?"

    side of the tail (inside the bowl). It's mostly the left-side onset of the tail
    that looks \"arbitrary\" to me &ndash; it feels like the tail doesn't deeply \"connect\"
    to the bowl, it's just kind of hanging somewhere.\r\nAlthough that loop you made

    with Craig that lowering could help. The serif on the top looks too heavy compared
    to the lower left serif.\r\nB: I'd look for guidance in the E and F to balance
    both bowls. Though I like the bar as is, I think it would take benefit from their
    sisters.\r\nC: Some of our curvy letters (C, G, O, Q) could need to overshoot
    up and down a bit (as D and S do it at the top). Perhaps it's wide also, as Nina
    says, but I'd like to see it taller before judging that.\r\nD: The stress seems

    nice shape. I agree with Craig it's out of character.\r\nJ: It deserves a hard

    as a whole, anyway.\r\nO: See my thoughts on the C. Nice balance.\r\nP: Hmmm...

  body: "I love that ampersand...\r\nThe A is now well balanced (though I cannot feel
    yet comfortable with the top serif, but don't take it in account).\r\nI'd make
    the spur of the G sharper and less heavy.\r\nYour  J \u2013the first one\u2013
    now looks great; perhaps the left serif is still long a bit.\r\nI like the newborn
    K, but the weight of the strokes is odd: the upper is too thick, while the lower
    is too thin (the should follow the same logic of the M or the V); it happens in
    both versions \u2013the latter is pretty good; the fat J bothers me, but it's
    just me.\r\nThe open P is nice. I'd like to see an alternate P with the tail of
    the bowl ascending, more B alike, but not too much.\r\nYour R suffers the same
    lightness in the stroke I pointed for the K; the bowl seems big, perhaps because
    of this; as with the K, I like the latter version the most.\r\nThe S is beautiful
    as is.\r\nI think the U is still unresolved in its inner curves.\r\nWith the V
    and W I have the same concerns exposed about the top serif of the A, but in that
    case I'm strongly in favor of a thin vertex gently overshooting the baseline.\r\nThe
    X definitely needs contrast (see notes on the K and R); once it's done, you'll
    need to shift the extremes of the thin stroke.\r\nThe Y has a poor contrast as
    well.\r\nI have to say the same about the Z, even though it's quite beautiful.\r\nYou'd
    have to clarify us some questions about the eventual lowercase set, guidance to
    find a name, and so on.\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n<strong>MarS</strong>"

    on V and W are odd, but I think fittingly so. If you keep them, think about spreading
    those bottom vertices of W away from each other.\r\n\r\nJ's curled end looks too
    flat at the vertical (could be antialiasing).\r\n\r\nThe shorter thin stroke of
    M looks pinched where it intersects at the middle of the glyph.\r\n\r\nZ looks
    like it has a little italic slope; is the top stroke too short?\r\n\r\nI don't
    like any of the alternates at the end. \r\n\r\nI think your A looks great as it,

    more weight/width.\r\nThe fat-flat-top \"A\" annoys me a bit; it think the top
    full-serif one is the best solution for much.\r\nI'd try making the upper stroke
    of the \"K\" gets thinner top to bottom, at least a half its current width.\r\nNow,
    looking thoroughly, the \"O\" \u2013and consequently the \"C\", \"G\", \"Q\"\u2013
    seems to be contrasted in excess, I mean: the thinner parts are too thin, especially
    against the other glyphs.\r\nYou've got a great challenge with the \"Q\". I'm
    not sure about saying anything.\r\nThe leg of the first \"R\" apparently needs
    more weight. Anyway, I like the second \"R\", though its bowl is excesively wide.\r\nI'm
    starting to enjoy the \"U\", as well as the V and W.\r\nAbout the \"X\", break
    the thin stroke to avoid the optical flaw that \u2013precisely\u2013 makes it

    of a counter) you could try a high crossbar like H has. Something like this (in
    structure):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_4006.gif]\r\n\r\nI

    and the significantly different letters were not present in the book title or
    whatever it was. Don't be discouraged, as you probably still have the right in
    this instance, and I think certain letters such as Z and J are much better than
    the original. The original K has you beat, though. The new P's have merit but
    I think you'll have to work harder to create worthy R's that go with them. You
    could also try other more fanciful changes; the possibility of a wineglass Y based
    on the U comes to mind.
