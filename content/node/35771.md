  body: "I'm not sure those manufactured letters are from a font. The width proportions
    seem poor, as if someone used a design for each letter without planning how they
    would all look together.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html">Gotham</a> was
    inspired by this kind of architectural lettering. The G is somewhat <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=gill+sans">Gill
    Sans</a>-like, but the M is way off (Gotham's as well BTW). <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=nobel">Nobel</a>
    exudes the same atmosphere but individual character shapes are also quite different.
