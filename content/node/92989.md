  Design: Now in Production]] at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York
  City, Ellen Lupton of the National Design Museum and Cara DiEdwardo of the Cooper
  Union will moderate a panel of type designers discussing the problems they have
  tackled. \r\n\r\nI am pleased that my font Williams Caslon Text is one of those
  in the exhibition, and I will be one of the panel discussing [[http://coopertype.org/curriculum/lectures/wicked-problems-in-type-design|Wicked
  Problems in Type Design]] on June 18 at the the Rose Auditorium of Cooper Union.
  The others speaking will be: Philippe Apeloig, Hubert Jocham, Henrik Kubel, Jeremy
  Mickel, and Jesse Ragan.\r\n\r\nI'm really excited about the event, which I think
  is guaranteed fun for type fanatics.  \r\n\r\n "
