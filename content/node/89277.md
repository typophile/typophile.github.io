  skool <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle\">sliding puzzle</a>.\r\n\r\nWithin
  the packaging will be a letter press card talking about world peace, the peace symbol,
  and a nob to my friend <a href=\"http://luc.devroye.org/fonts.html\"> Luc Devroye
  </a>(inglorious basterd that he is!) who came out with a font called Wahei (awesome
  peace symbol dingbat font), which I used here and once before in my World Peace
  graphic.\r\n\r\nIt is my intention to have every peace org carry this puzzle, I'm
  going to approach every single one of them and see what's what.\r\n\r\nThought I'd
  share."
