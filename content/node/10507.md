  I follow the Mr. Carbaga manual &#40;Learn Fontlab Fast&#41; : <i>see page 72 :
  To add the Space character to a string, type&#92;0020 &#40;then a space...</i>.
  I did but nothing happen. <BR> <BR>Help please! Thanks'

  body: '\0020 will only work if the space glyph is correctly encoded. If you have
    a glyph in the font called &#39;space&#39;, try running the Assign Unicode command
    from the Glyph menu. This will assign Unicode values to glyphs based on their
    names, following a mapping list &#40;the default will be the STANDARD.NAM file
    that comes with FontLab&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also note that in preview and metrics strings
    etc. you can also enter a glyph by name, using this convention: /space'

    This line seems to me little useful. Is there anybody who can help me to use it
    effectively?\r\n\r\nThanks"

    after I finally got all my main glyphs into fontlab I ran into the exact same
