  body: Because a label is the only thing that sets some spirits apart the manufacturers
    understandably spend a lot of money on the packaging. This often means custom
    type. Consider <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/zemestro_medium/">Zemestro</a>
    or <a href="http://vllg.com/Feliciano/Morgan/mudTyper+Weights/">Morgan</a> as
    alternatives.

    of money spent on liquor packaging is interesting, I was just thinking how many
    bottles have really excellent design/typography."
