  body: Almost certainly made by hand. Those strokes are a mess. If you like that
    kind of 'S', check out <a href="http://vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexSans/mudTyper+Weights/">Apex
    Sans</a> and <a href="http://vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/">Apex

  body: Really? I've seen sans serif lettering with an "S" very similar to that used
    elsewhere. Thanks for your help.
