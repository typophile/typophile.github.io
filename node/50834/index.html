  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Afternoon all,

I'm currently looking at how the study of the effects of [[aesthetics]] on [[legibility]] can help to improve the reader experience.

Now I know this is a very much debated area, the whole area of "how do you measure legibility" (of which http://typophile.com/node/41365 is a great thread), and the fact that aesthetics are subjective (as I believe is legibility to a point - reader preference, familiarity, etc.).

What I am looking at, is if the conducting of legibility tests, followed by subjective aesthetics tests (in which various samples would be created with varying levels of creative elements and the same tests applied as in the legibility studies as well as preference, etc.) to see if it is possible to find a balance point between the two. The theory is that if you can find a point where the legibility is maximised, and then find the point where the aesthetics don't negatively affect the legibility, then you can effectively improve the reader experience.

My thought behind the possible application of this is in uses such as study materials and required reading. For example if you can increase the aesthetics to a point where they are maximised without decreasing the legibility of the text, can you in theory improve the reader experience, and would it have an additional effect on other aspects; retention, comprehension.

I know this possibly sounds a little vague, but I'm really interested in people's thoughts on this.

Thanks   </div>

(aek chew alley, I agree with you that aesthetics are an important component of legibility. They're also what gets left out of any legibility testing I'm aware of. It is absolutely crucial to any understanding of legibility, readin' ritin' and comprehension in general. Aesthetics is the part of design that gets dismissed immediately by those folks who want to figure out how reading works. After all, designers just want to make things look attractive and beautiful, right?, And this gets in the way of real scientific understanding. Right?. But really - what is, or, are aesthetics, other than the way we humans tend to like to have things organized so that we can comprehend them. A chart, or a dense passage of text that can be described as "Pleasing to the eye" is probably better, i.e. more readable and comprehensible than one that could be described as "A dog's breakfast". 

But, how do you test for the aesthetic component in any credible way without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars? In all seriousness, more like Millions of dollars. It's not a small problem. I do know how far a hundred grand will get you and that's really not much to write home about. Personally, I think that good designer or artists understand aesthetics in their bones. It's a non verbal kind of intelligence and unless the results of any such research are applied to further developing those skills for  future designers, I really don't see the point. Scientifically design type is like scientifically through basket balls... You may know all the physics, but it doesn't mean you can through a ball.

Interesting comments you make there, especially those about the cost of the aesthetics testing. Do you think it's possible though to look at these criteria on a case by case basis and then build almost a kind of process for creating reading materials that maximise the reader experience whilst retaining the highest possible level of legibility. Maybe it's more from a user testing perspective rather than a definitive 'these are aesthetics' perspective?

<em>Aesthetics is the part of design that gets dismissed immediately by those folks who want to figure out how reading works</em>

This is part of my frustrations also, and the idea is to look to see if you can keep a partial focus on the aesthetics, so when it comes to layout and design of the material as opposed to just the 'science' of the text, you can ensure that the legibility isn't compromised. It's all born out of a frustration with complying with standards and legibility, and how you can make them work together.

Sorry if I'm rambling, I've currently got the lurgy and am not thinking quite straight! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the article <cite>Measuring the reading experience</cite> in Typo Magazine Issue 22, I wrote about my experiences in attempting to measure aesthetic aspects of typography. It’s known that people perform better on cognitive tasks after being induced into a good mood by receiving a gift or seeing something pleasing. I examined if it was possible to do this with typography and found improvements both on the candle task (a cognitive task) and a reduction in the amount of activity in the corrugator (frowning) muscle after reading with better typography.

It doesn’t cost millions of dollars to do this. In fact I did a live demonstration of this effect at ATypI in Helsinki with the remote associates task (a different cognitive task). After listening to me drone on for a while, I asked the audience to find the word in common with <cite>swiss, cottage, and cake</cite> (answer = cheese). Perhaps half of the audience found the correct answer. Then after listening to the highly entertaining Herr Spiekermann for a minute, I asked the audience to find a different remote associate, which about three quarters of the audience found. It didn’t cost a penny to run.

Cheers, Kevin

There are five studies with 3 different pairs of document styles discussed in the article. One pair is of good and poor page layout including good and poor image placement. Another pair either included or omitted OpenType layout features such as ligatures and small caps. The third pair had either reasonable h&j, or had severe problems with rivers. There are pictures of the document styles in the Typo article.

I have not seen studies showing benefits of layout since Ulm Hochscule fur Gestaltung journals of the late 1950s [written by Gui Bonsieppe]. Do you know of any more research in that area being done? There are loads of stuff on legibility but little on typographic layout.

		<div class="commentbody">re the cost... Granted, Kevin - All I know about the cost of research has to do with a single project, that was too way expensive and not very productive of useful information. Still, I can extrapolate from that, and say that if one got, say 10% of a useful result at one price, then a wild guess at the cost of 100% a useful result will be at least 10 time as much. :o)

I think that perhaps what your experiment at ATypI showed was that what most of us already intuit from personal and professional experience is valid and common to all of us and it's measurable. But where does one go from there? To prove that rocket prolusion actually works, all you need is a balloon, but building on that knowledge enough to get to the moon is not going to come cheap. 

Not that anyone really needs to go to the moon. :o)

It would be fascinating to hear when Kevlar could condone necessary malignment in his field, if not here. A two-font, one-document, 20 or so 20-something subjects, dead-end studied to within one thin human hair thickness of anecdotal, and he loves it!

"...showing that your perception of the content itself is impacted by the typeface used..."
NO KIDDING!? Song & Schwarz doesn't do that though, preferring to let the results become muddied by badly conceived type selection and by badly implemented type composition.

"Arial is the best font for reading"  (says Song). 'Nuff said? Maybe not. How does finding a remote associate via presentation, have anything whatsoever to do with reading? 

There now, I've strained my left corrugator muscle.

		<div class="commentbody">There are ways to criticize every study, but sometimes it's more useful to talk about the positive aspects of projects.

The question being discussed is how to measure aesthetics. The typographic conditions in the Song & Schwarz may not be terribly useful, but along with the studies I wrote about in Typo, these are possible methodologies for measuring the reading experience that go beyond letter legibility and reading speed measurements. With these methodologies you could use your own typographic expertise to compare conditions that you find interesting. It's a choice between improving on the existing research or criticizing from the peanut gallery.

		<div class="commentbody">Scientists do science, which is a methodology that tends to limit the scope of individual experiments so as to ensure a solid basis for furture work, rather than overreaching itself. This narrow experimental focus may indeed look like 'tunnel vision', and it often guaranteed to make any individual experiment appear either insignificant or banal to an outside observer, especially one who may have extensive practical or anecdotal experience of the thing being studied. But the point of any individual experiment is not to answer a grand question, but to see whether the result contradicts or supports the results of other experiments. And occasionally the results will contradict the beliefs of the non-scientific practitioner, and that's when things get interesting for the rest of us.</div>

I wasn't conflating a particular instance of tunnel vision (Song & Schwartz) with the scientific method in general.

However, I do think that Blake's <em>Newton</em> is relevant.
Designers have tried to reduce type design to mathematical principle for centuries, but it never works.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For me science measures only what it sees in nature. Behavioral science only measures what it thinks it sees in human behavior. Humans often think and do things that are not visible or measurable. The products developed by humans can be analyzed by science after creation but not until then. Measuring a product after creation does not necessarily yield a path for science to create a better product of a similar kind. Patterned simplification can lead to measurable malfunction.

		<div class="commentbody">There are some really interesting things being said here. [as a designer] I can understand the frustration of trying to reduce design & typography to a set formula, it does in some ways take the creativity out of design, but could you also use it for the reverse effect?

I'm quite interested as it would appear that some of the views here are against using scientific research at all in the design process. Considering this, do you feel that the science could fit into the process, even if it is just to create a process? Does anyone feel that the research would be useful in qualifying design choices to clients, after all, I know how annoying it is when a clients only qualifying statement is "because I like it".

Do you think you could do a study into the emotional reaction to a typeface, a simple "what feeling does it conjure for you?" to see if there is a correlation between opinions to help inform typographic choices? 

Please bear in mind that I'm in no way suggesting that scientific or subjective market research should take over from intuitive decisions on the part of the designer, after all, it is what the training is for, but how do you guys feel about this?  </div>

Market research and product development can use scientific principles to test how well a design <em>might</em> work.
But how a creative product tests (which may be compared to polling) and how it performs when launched are two different things.
There's no such thing as a sure thing, and sequels are rarely as good as the original.
There's no substitute for 10,000 hours of experience.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Science can havr its place and its value. We must, however, guard against results being presented as scientific being placed on a pedestal and viewed as absolute truth because the name "Science" has been attached to it. Science once told us that Pluto was a Planet; now it says, not so. I don't pretend to know which conclusion is correct but it is clear that scientists can error as much as the rest of us. All scientific results need to be scrutinized and questioned. All research methods and procedures need to be examined and questioned without being held in awe. To me, the biggest issue is that the conclusions that are drawn from data are made by humans. The data may be correct but the conclusion may be wrong. If data tells me that regressions in reading are greater when a reader comes across a word in italic, that may indicate that italic is harder to read or it may also tell us that the reader is pausing to contemplate why that word is in italics or just triggers a memory like "I remember reading that book in college." Both may be true but how do we know? There is judgement in analyzing data just as there is in designing a glyph visually. Either can be misjudged. The difference is that we just say the designer made a human error while we are not so quick to be as critical of anything residing  in the realm of science.

		<div class="commentbody">Eben - I'm completely aware that the second half of the tests are very subjective and don't really constitute a scientific test, but the idea is that if you were to couple these with scientific tests for reading speed, comprehension, retention, etc. then you could use them to an advantage. I'm trying to find if there is a benefit in using subjective aesthetics testing to benefit the scientific part of the research, the 'case study' part being "can it benefit the reader experience"

I understand the need to include type designers, or at least designers who are aware of the essentials of type design. I am a graphic designer with a strong interest in typography, I am working on designing my own typefaces, and also work a lot with graffiti and handwriting (one of my interests is the crossover that these have with typography, where the lines blur, etc.) so I'm not <strong>too</strong> naive, but I don't profess to know all about the area.

I don't think this 'teeth gnashing' is all naive and silly, as it tells a lot about how the designers feel about the process. You get to the point where you can find out exactly <strong>why</strong> they feel like this and then you can find a way either around, or to turn this to the advantage and use it to aid the process. Surely that's of benefit, analysing problems to find solutions?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">>I’m trying to find if there is a benefit in using subjective aesthetics testing to benefit the scientific part of the research, the ’case study’ part being “can it benefit the reader experience”<

This is excellent. But it is completely wrong. However, the fix is simple: simply invert it to 'the case study part being "do [good aesthetics] <em>detract</em> from the reader experience?"'

It stands to reason that good aesthetics are noticeable as such, and the time spent noticing them will be time wasted on admiring aesthetics when all time spent reading needs to be spent . . . reading.

The problem with type designers today is that they are obsessed with harmonious aesthetics to the detriment of readability. Graphic design is not, in many respects, a good foundation for readable type design. Because what the graphic designer finds beautiful, harmonious and attention-getting is a thrust that does not relate at all to what the reader finds easy to read. 

I see graphic design as being primarily about a kind of macro experience and type design as being primarily a kind of micro experience. (That's a very bad way of expressing it but the best I can do at this moment -- enough maybe to get the germ of the idea across?) This was brought home to me when I had a glance at Paul Hunt's Reading project. The typeface seems to have tentacles that want to reach into the very fibres of the paper. Here, I thought, one could see a design axis, a design will, a design theory, a design practice, a praxis, that was relevant to <em>reading</em>.

It was brought home to me in a different way when I saw a large dual column edition of Shaw's essays set magnificently in metal Fournier. The pages all but read themselves. 

The moral of that experience was one I have felt was paramount since I first tried to design type: nobody, nobody, nobody, is ever going to get <em>reading</em> until they start designing single-size fonts. A single master used at multiple sizes is always a fatally maimed 'monstrico'. Nor is there the slightest justification for single-master/multiple size fonts other than money, money, money. 

You can ask: 'where is the money for us to design single-size fonts? We can't afford to spend ten years, rather than one, on a text design that only a few will buy.'

Maybe the answer lies in T.S. Eliot's prescription that the poet needs to have a job separate from poetry.

Certainly, if you look at what is happening today, with the designers who <em>are</em> designing single size type, that is what happens. Two examples: Robert Slimbach's new Garamond (which with four entirely separate optical multiple masters can be permitted, for this argument, to count as single-size) was designed <em>entirely in his spare time</em> over a period of many years. In this he is still following the direction of Sumner Stone who cannot possibly be making enough money from the great Cycles family to compensate him for the endless thousands of hours of development and sheer <em>being</em> that it cost over a period of more than a decade, and continues to cost. 

So I guess my larger point is that there is no point in talking about readability until you have thought through some of the obstacles to readability which have been set in motion by the direction that typeface design has taken since, roughly, 1960. </div>

Eben, of course it is! That is my point and it is not the scientists fault. The reason more tests are not done and that more useful results don't come out is that there are so many variables to control, which are so far not possible to control, as to make both the test too complex or the data too vague. Other issues are that there is very little financial support for this arena of work and the potential of monetary profit is small.

"all this gnashing of teeth about scientists coming in to stamp all over our nice typographic grass is a bit silly as well and frankly just as naive."

Who said that scientists are coming in and taking our turf? Not me. Scientists are not coming in and there is very little work done in the area of typography. My beef is not with the scientists--there are several in my family. My beef is with the rest of us who jump beyond the scientists conclusions and give the studies greater weight than even the scientists who made them. Scientists are not afraid to question each other but we are afraid to question results or to limit the scope of results to the level intended by the scientists. Scientists work incrementally. They take a small piece of the puzzle and analyze what bits they can and build upon the previous work done by others, Other scientists take different chunks either independently or cooperatively. After years, there is a body of work which others look at objectively and may prompt yet another study. This goes on for years. The scientists are not in awe of each other; they just work and read what others have published.

We all need to stop being so full of ourselves and just look at our role pragmatically, even naively. When we pull and push control points about in FontLab, we are experimenting, too. It may not be rigorous scientific method but we control some variable and change others. I have prattled long enough.

...oh let's not forget the peanut gallery, the Other... who actually measure the humans of specific groups and outfit them with aesthetics to fit. Or, who you callin' peanut gallery, peanut gallery's peanut gallery? ;)

CA: "...it would appear that some of the views here are against using scientific research at all in the design process."

On the contrary, that is how we work: the client feels dark we lighten the type, the clients feel happy we put on the swash. Seriously though, our process of outfitting clients with fonts, a subset of the font selection process for sure, is a scientific progress from an unknown through a growing known, to an optimized legible aesthetic for some kind of foreseen reader experience. We do not do this arbitrarily, but rather progress from small to large glyph repertoires, one to more styles, and from general to specific composition, in search of specific complimentary and contrasting typographic aesthetics, to reach that foreseen reader experience.

I am against most reading research that does not involve reading. I have never been against good scientific research, which I define for one thing, as offering identification of the type(s) used, and the composition(s) and includes in the results, these specifications and examples of the typography as presented to the study subjects. I have also never been against good scientific research on scientific research on design legibility and aesthetics, as Kevlar talks a lot about. But as one can see, sometimes, some forget where the peanut gallery is, and where the use of scientific research is just another live wire in the design business.

Cheers!

I've designed several, some as commissions, some as retail.
For instance, a text font for the Globe and Mail newspaper, and a revival of a 19th century book face.

Of course, people will use them at sizes other than for what they were originally created.
However, that is their prerogative.
The idea that a typeface will only work at a given size is mistaken, because it ignores the contribution of the typographer, and the effect that different layouts, media, and reading environments have on the effect of type and process of reading, not to mention the variability of reading skills and style, and content.

This is not to say that the idea of size-specific fonts is wrong, just that text fonts work within ranges, and the specification is as much the typographer's as the foundry's--and online, the reader's. Isn't this appropriately post-modern for the 21st century, multiple authorship?</div>

I quite agree! Scientists are NOT the problem, WE are. Perhaps you missed my other comment a few posts below the one you quoted: "Scientists are not afraid to question each other but we are afraid to question results or to limit the scope of results to the level intended by the scientists"
An example of what I mean is a recent quote taken out of context. There was a study done regarding screen fonts on web sites. The only fonts tested were bundled fonts in certain screen read situations. The quote taken out of context said something to the effect "therefore, Arial is the best font for reading" leaving out all the conditions of the study and making the reader think that Arial is the best font for reading anything anywhere anytime. The researcher did not say or intend this but never the less some non-scientist (I can't recall but I think he was an editor of some sort) jumped all over it and took it as god's gospel because it was "science". You can be sure that a true scientist would have been quick to point out his error.

		<div class="commentbody">“The reclassification of Pluto isn’t evidence of scientific error: it is evidence of science being done.” [John Hudson]

This obscures the fact that nothing new about Pluto was actually revealed (though it seemed at first that someting new about Plato was being proposed): the reclassification of Pluto had to do with a redefinition of planethood. Taking this into the realm of metaphor though, if Socrates was the sun, might Plato not be admitted to planethood after all?
See: http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060824_planet_definition.html

How my comment about reclassification on account of redefinition applies to the issue at hand is that, if legibility or readbility are operationalized in terms of eye movement patterns (saccadic amplitude and the absence of regressios), or ease of visual word form resolution (as quantified by the size of the word superiority effect), rather than simple reading speed, or the simple <em>discrimination affordance</em> of letter shapes under compromised conditions caused by distance or illumination, what counts as a legible or readible font might be expanded or contracted or reclassified.

Improving the reader’s experience can of course involve all of these things, but often includes much more, including introducing elements that enhance expressive specificity but have measurable — but non-fatal — perceptual processing costs. Some of the ‘much more’ might only be accessible to anecdotal report.</div>

Well said, Peter!

When the elements of a fonts design or positioning are purposely strayed from best practices of reading in order to enhance comprehension of meaning, your conditions are met. 
An example might be the word "Help" in one instance set in white in Clearview on a plain green background; in the second instance the same word "Help" hand scribbled in red (as if traced in blood). In the second case, the legibility factors are negatively impacted but the communication is enhanced without another word being added.

		<div class="commentbody">I'll give you a good example of how typeface design impacts readability. Penguin puts out an excellent set of historical atlases in 9" x 7" softcover format, text by Colin McEvedy. The text was originally printed in Times Roman at about 8, perfectly legible and a pleasure to read. The layout encouraged comprehension. Later, they reprinted these books, same size, but with the typeface changed to one (I forget which right now and I'm too lazy to track it down) with a relatively higher x-height and at slightly larger size, reducing the white space. The design is less attractive and the text less legible, never mind that the point size is bigger. I wanted to sue.

"Scientists are the least likely people to put scientific results on a pedestal, since they know that future science will probably demonstrate the inaccuracies in those results."

Another way of saying it is that 'scientists' who do put results on a pedestal, ready to defend it in all cases, are suspect as is their science.

"How is it possible to know whether it’s typeface or type size that’s affecting readability?"

Exactly, or other composition affecting the results that most studies seem utterly oblivious of. Most don't even bother to publish the compositions used in the studies. These things and more make any amount of maligning of Song & Schwarz, e.g. insufficient.

In my ICTVC 2004 presentation I said a tabulation of the perceptual processing impact of manipulating type-form microvariables is maddeningly elusive. I tried to suggest we look at specific determinants of ‘perceptual discrimination affordance’ in letters or specific determinants of the effective and automatic formation of ’word-level codes’ with words, like lateral interference or crowding, response-bias, cue value and computation costs as some of the areas that are effected.

It is not enough to change a variable, measure the effect along a single raw dimension like reading speed and then conclude ’readability’ is improved. This becomes blinding. We go around in circles. We stop trusting our cultivated vision and craft wisdom. We kid ourselves into thinking we have understood readability in this way. We've gained no understanding at all of what our type-forming micro-decisions actually <strong>do</strong> <em>in perceptual-processing terms</em>. We can sense and experience what occurs, but we haven't deepened our vision and craft wisdom with evidential knowledge about what occurs. Yet, intelligent design requires just that. 

We need to know, for example how spacing affects the formation of word-level codes. How does too wide or overly tight spacing disrupt this? Why? What are the tolerences? 

Or we need to know, does decreasing stroke contrast, or making it variable effect the cue-value of distinctive features in such a way that word-level codes are harder to assemble in the visual cortex.

Many sciences have acheived this level of specificity and particularity. Why not the science of reading?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, it is easy to take the piss, and no doubt tempting with such thick prose -  but actually lateral interference or crowding, response-bias, cue value and computation costs are all specific and distinctive ideas which have emerged from psychological testing. I am about to study this crowding thing and with any luck the others because I am going to run a test to see if some CALT shapes I am going to design as replacements to the regular letters aid in speed and or accuracy when reading. The final shape of the test and the extensiveness of it are TBD. And as I said I need to come up to speed in the primary lit for this kind of testing. But I am hoping to find something nifty! If you would be willing to talk to me about it as it's getting designed that would sure be "pukka" as they say here in Old Blighty. Wadda ya say?</div>

David, I think it's not so hard to see that over-tracking causes the word to fall apart as an integral object-like unit, and under-tracking leads to crowding, but wouldn't it be nice to know precisely why both these things disrupt reading, or how exactly having an integral object-like unit improves reading?

Explain to me in perceptual psychophysical or perceptual-mechanical — perceptual science — terms why it is important — if it is — that the cluster of letters form an optically integral or cohesive object-like unit. Why might it be important that the word as a visual unit resist easy deomposition into it's constitutent letters?  Isn’t this the implicit belief that motivates type-design? Talk to me about the work that the visual cortex performs in reading that makes this desirable or mandatory.

Knowing this might give weight to our fetishistic attention to spacing.</div>

As far as I see, rather than describing too tight spacing, "crowding" actually results from <em>good</em> spacing -- "crowding" in the way Eben uses it is formation of "gestalt", or what you seem to call an "integral object-like unit" which, with the subject at hand, may safely be called "word". The latter part of the quote I don't understand though. What "how exactly"? Ideal reading conditions means words that are distinguishable and recognizable as such. What riddle is there that needs to be solved?
By the way, I am amused by the term "crowding", especially when confronting it with the older "gestalt". Both acknowledge the same phenomenon but approach it from opposite directions. It looks like the "crowding" is rooted in Anglo-American philosophic tradition which is obsessed with reducing everything to smallest particles as if these had some built-in evidence, but gets trapped in the un-answerable question, how come that we are able to get from these particles to a unity? From sensual impressions to conceptions, ideas, objects? (The "reference" problem.) "Crowding" nicely reflects this, alluding to a bunch of particles lumped together <em>somehow</em>. "Gestalt" instead starts out with concepts, ideas, objects -- the unity which "crowding" acknowledges, wants to explain, but does not really know how. From a "gestalt" perspective, perception is perception of objects, period, and particles are recognized only in as far as they form unity.

Aesthetics draws the eyes' attention during reading.

		<div class="commentbody">Karsten, it is possible both to track too tightly and hurt readability, and too loosely and hurt readability. In both cases the "gestalt" of words is hurt, but in different ways. Peter's theory is a gestalt theory of reading, not an 'atomistic' one, if you take the atoms to be letters.  

"Crowding" refers to close proximity that hurts quick identification of letters. It is something there is a whole literature on, Peter tells me. The connection of it to the ease of what Peter calls "word form resolution", or what you could call "word gestalt" is complex, and not yet studied. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Karsten, Eben hasn't said how he defines crowding, but in the psychological literature the follwing is a representative: “Crowding is defined as impaired recognition of a suprathreshold target due to the presence of distractor elements in the neighborhood of that target.” [from: Christopher W. Tyler and Lora T. Likova, “Crowding: A neuroanalytic approach” Journal of Vision (2007) 7(2):16, 1–9 http://journalofvision.org/7/2/16/]. I’m not sure I'd say it underlies the seeing of gestalts as wholes.

You asked, “[w]hat riddle is there that needs to be solved?” I’m not sure it’s Chris Allen’s so I probably shouldn’t press it, but my riddle is, is the current way of schematizing reading, as for instance, an automatic process mediated by the activation of abstract letter identities, correct? If it is, it might be difficult to understand why it is important that the cluster of letters form an optically integral or cohesive object-like unit / gestalt.

The current way of schematizing reading would put letter-form construction into the domain of legibility, or as I like to say, perceptual discrimination affordance, and gestalt-integrity into the domain of aesthetics. I want to believe, however, that there are “perceptual processing in reading” reasons for attending, in type design, to issues of gestalt integrity, or as I like to say, the optical-grammatical cohesiveness of the letter cluster, considered as a bounded map of black and white sub-letter forms.

To make progress with Chris’s question it might be important to resolve this <em>fundamental disconnect</em> between the priorities of type design and a central aasumption of the science of reading.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed I read your remarks in the light of what I read about crowding before -- and placed your remarks in the same category. My mistake. Thanks for the clarification and also for an additional article.

I am aware that crowding is described as something negative, disturbance rather than formation, yet think one might reinterpret it as formation rather than disturbance. I see traces of such a reinterpretation in this <a href="http://lpp.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/pdf/PapersPC/2001/Cavanagh-4-2001-673-674.pdf">introductory article</a> but may err.
My problem with the conception of crowding is in its implicit premises. Bill, as you indicate, these studies deal with crowding only in so far as it disturbs identification of <em>individual</em> letters -- which presupposes an atomistic model of perception. Moreover, they try to explain perception as a mere technical process, as mechanics of the eye and brain. There is nothing wrong with describing the "technical" conditions for perception, but if the goal is to <em>explain</em> perception on this level alone, I fear they are on the wrong track.

Interestingly, the article which you recommend in your latest post refers to this one -- Korte: "Ueber die Gestaltauffassung im indirekten Sehen", 1923 -- and I am curious to read it. At least the title makes direct reference to gestalt. (It looks like crowding, as dealt with in articles today, is the result of transplanting a observation from gestalt context into an atomistic context. Need to read this text.)</div>

I think you’re quite right that “these studies deal with crowding only in so far as it disturbs identification of individual letters.” The Patrick Cavanagh review deals with peripheral vision. It helped me see that the important function of crowding in parafoveal preview is to constrain it to assembling ‘accurate ensemble statistics.’ Wxactly what these ensemble statistics are or have a bearing in is unclear, but they go beyond just ‘envelope structure,’ or other markers of simple word-shape. Foveal vision is still required in visual word-form resolution, but what occurs there is contextualized and facilitated by this assembly process. 

Most studies don't deal with crowding in foveal vision. I think crowding comes into play under various conditions in foveal vision. I'd love to explore this with you and others further, but maybe in a new thread.</div>

Yes, well, we've been there before. Only people who don't know enough about the parts that are smaller than letters, consider the letter the atom.

The convenience of common symbols (letters), and the words we have in common for the names of letters used on eye charts, does not seem to stop "scientists" from confusion over the difference between seeing letter, and reading words, lines, paragraphs and pages and pages of text.

When one's definition and study of "crowding" is another's definition of  "normal everyday composition for the purpose of reading", (as in Tyler & Likova), I say you have 20/20 proof!

Philosophically that 's not possible. In type design aesthetics *is* functionality, and aesthetics is impervious to scientific analysis.

In other kinds of design, it may be possible to separate function from visual style, but not type, because it only exists to be looked at.

I can be categorical as well. In type design aesthetics and functionality are intertwined. Functionality is foundational; aesthetics a humanistic <em>experience-improving</em> virtue or <em>plus value</em>. Good spacing plays a role in rapid automatic visual word-form resolution. It also looks nice.

Philosophically type design is feature-manipulation. The perceptual processing impact of feature manipulation  — to what degree it affords or promotes seamless or effortless network relaxation inside the visual cortex, for instance — is not, in principle, impervious to scientific analysis. Every feature-manipulative move has an aesthetic or gestural-atmospheric impact as well. That aesthetics resists quantitative formalization and technological control or automation doesn't mean the structures it puts in place, or the type of experience it promotes can't be rigorously explored. </div>

What I mean is that other design objects have functions that are independent of how they appear to the eye.

Now, the aesthetics of, say, a chair, may be how it feels to sit in, or of a knife, how it feels to cut with, and in that sense the aesthetics is very functional and no different than with type. But don't people usually use the term aesthetics as part of a duality which splits "mere" visual styling from the "ugliness" of mere function? I don't believe you can do that with type. If it doesn't work it has poor aesthetics; it can't have good aesthetics and not work.

If you look at the words to appreciate the shape of their letters, that's not reading, is it?

<em>Good spacing plays a role in rapid automatic visual word-form resolution. It also looks nice.</em>

Exactly; there is no difference. Spacing is quite literally all about looking nice ("precise").

<em>That aesthetics resists quantitative formalization and technological control or automation doesn’t mean the structures it puts in place, or the type of experience it promotes can’t be rigorously explored.</em>

Agreed, but people expect that such exploration will lead to scientific principles which can be used to engineer predictable results, and that's not possible--at least, not at the "expert" level you alluded to Peter.</div>

I'm much more comfortable with that. Unlike in some other design domains both the functionality and the aesthetics of typographic objects are tied up with how they look.

Perhaps, but case-specific affordance ranges and thresholds can be fairly tightly scripted. And these thresholds and ranges impose practical benchmarks or constraints. At distance x and type-size y typeface z will not be easily readable under nightime driving conditions from a distance d assuming a driving speed s for people with 20 / 20 vision.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My riddle again, this time framed in Denis Pelli & Katherine Tillman’s terms.

Denis Pelli & Katherine Tillman write (The uncrowdend window of object recognition, <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, 2008): ”Some objects are recognized through a single combining of features over the whole object, whereas other objects require separate combining over each of several regions of the object. The distinct regions define parts. In an object with multiple parts, each part must be recognized before they are all joined together.”

What is the case with words?

Is the combining metaphor right?

If reading involves the former, improving the experience might involve facilitating a single combining of features over the whole object; if reading involves the latter, improving the experience might involve facilitating separate combining over each of several regions of the object.

What should type do?

Cognitive and perceptual science seems biased toward the latter; tpyographers and type designers seem biased toward the former.</div>

That's because what a good type designer/typographer knows how to do is:

facilitate separate combining over each of several regions of the object

by:

facilitating a single combining of features over the whole object.</div>

So, reading some arabic or most chinese, carpet or carpentry appreciation, landscape, seascape or sky cape recognition, follows recognition of each part? What should type do? As it must do everything for all readers, it does. No one here should tell you there is no recognition by letter any more than anyone "out there" should tell us that there is no recognition by word. 

Peter:"Explain to me in perceptual psycho-physical or perceptual-mechanical — perceptual science — terms why it is important — if it is — that the cluster of letters form an optically integral or cohesive object-like unit."

It is important — I know it is — that the cluster of letters form an optically integral or cohesive object-like unit, for if any of the thousands of clusters expected from a cluster-making mechanism fail to present clusters of sufficient optical integrity or cohesive object-like unitization, (or proper cluster separation or deunitization), then the mechanism responsible for the failure will not likely yield sufficient financial rewards to allow its maker future cluster-making mechanism occupation.

No one does. It’s just how these things are schematized — given what is know about human physiology, the structure of the visual cortex, information processing and neuro-mechanics — that gets me going. 

But why should that matter? Typography and type design have gotten pretty far with it’s own type-tribal inuitions about these thiings.

“[…] facilitate separate combining over each of several regions of the object by: facilitating a single combining of features over the whole object.” [Bill T]

I’m not sure this can be done. I'm assuming wide spacing and closed forms would do the former, while rhythmic spacing and forms open to each other might do the latter. Also, closed forms might be more susceptible to crowding.

Instead of integration or combining, I think in terms of quantization. This involves resolving the information derived from the retinal and ganglion projections of stroke complexes into role-units, like stems and bowls and counters. As I see it now, quantization occurs at salient centres, but simultaneously and interactively all across the bounded map or uncrowded span. Combining isn't done, and parts (in the Pelli / Tillman sense) don’t emerge as labelled entities, but role-unit identities and direct associations are noted and calculated, along with positional information.

When a criterial amount of information at the role-unit level is resolved, lexical identity emerges and the reader moves on.</div>

But corrected, it's a flawed statement nevertheless, because it ain't "our" intuitions we work towards you know.

As they say, the shoemaker may be better at making the shoe, but it is wearer who says whether the shoe pinches.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Jelmar’s right. Many aspects of reading are effectively discussed in Gerard Unger’s engaging <em>While You’re Reading</em>. See especially the chapters “Disappearing Types, ”The Process," and “Reader’s Eyes.” The account is accessible, worth-while and as Unger himself says, “greatly simplified.”

To my mind Unger takes at face value too much of what is concluded about foveal vision and parafoveal preview in the studies his account relies on. In a section that relates to the specifics at hand, Unger writes: “In one model, each letter is read individually and words are similarly compiled one by one. Meanings are then allocated to each word and the words are then assigned to their places in the sentance. In this way a text is reproduced and comprehension built up in a step-by-step process. This may be how it works with children learning to read and at the same time learning to link sounds to letters. In the case of experienced readers the process may be different. Once the experienced reader has got going, he is thought to project ahead of him, as it were, expectations regarding the content. He takes in the text several words at a time, testing his expectations […]”

The “each letter is read individually” might seem innocent enough, but how might the process be different in the case of experienced readers, if it is? Other models of how reading might be different at the letter-assembly stage are not discussed.</div>

Actually, we did a study to measure how much each of these processes contributes to reading. We went to a lot of trouble to use methods that would be convincing. What do you think?

		<div class="commentbody">Prof. Pelli, thank you for pointing to your article; I had not seen that paper before. As one of the people who has been strongly advocating the view that letters are the primary route to word recognition, I think this is a nice demonstration that there is are whole word and context components to word recognition.

I’m struggling with the context only condition (+S –L-W). Earlier studies that asked readers to predict the next word in a sentence found that people could only guess the next word ~20% of the time, and function words made up most of the correct guesses. How were you able to get the accuracy rate up to 80% in order to measure the reading speed of this sentence: “eE TbF FrD Qt fHe nQcM A”? Presumably there is accurate word length information here that wasn’t present in earlier studies, but 80% still seems high even with infinite time. Was some sort of adjustment made to get a RT for this condition?

Could you explain how was Table 2 created from Table 1? I haven’t figured out how you made that transformation.

Cheers, Kevin Larson

good question. no, there's no adjustment, but bear in mind that a difference between our method and "guess the next word in the sentence" is that our observers, because they had unlimited response time, could also use context information from the FOLLOWING words in the sequence of 6 if it helped them. you are asking how people still managed to read well enough to measure an 80% threshold in the hardest cases. it was mostly a matter of getting some practice with the substitutes (overcoming the knockout), and partly that even letters that did have substitutes weren't always substituted (randomly, they were occasionally "substituted" by themselves). in the demo that you quote, we did all the substituting possible, to maximize the intensity and purity of the experience for the readers of our article. we talk about this in the methods: "The L knockout by substitution is quite effective, but not total. We attribute the residual reading rate (50 word/min) in the triple-knockout condition (see Table 1) to letter decoding, i.e. we think that L as reported here slightly underestimates the true value of the process. We tried making the knockout more severe (by not allowing a same-letter substitution when alternatives were available) but, as one would expect, this makes some conditions untestable because the observer cannot reach 80% correct at any presentation rate." thus, in the "S-only" case that you ask about, we think observers were still getting some help from L. 

<em>"Could you explain how was Table 2 created from Table 1? I haven’t figured out how you made that transformation."</em>

getting from table 1 to table 2 is a matter of fitting the LWS model (R = L + W + S + e) to the measured reading rates, minimizing the error across all 8 conditions. table 1 shows the measured rates and table 2 is the model fits.

does that help?

		<div class="commentbody">Fabulous! As one of the people who has been strongly advocating the view that letters are only among the routes to text recognition, I believe this is the best demonstration I've seen that there are whole word and context components to the process.

From the study: "We can be confident that each of these three manipulations affects only one of the three sources of word information in the text."

I can't be confident in this unfortunately. In the study's analogy to a store, this study uses lying customers (surrounding mangled words) to come 'round and "shout" at the sales people while they are trying to understand their chosen customer (word). This is done, e.g. by alternating case in words? I cannot help but think this is over-doing it (shouting), as opposed to using small caps instead of uppercase, and systematically replacing only ascending and descending letters (whispering the word shape away).

To put S&S's study into this study's store analogy, one'd be asking the store management if they thought the sales force would think it easier to serve a crowd of "expected customer types", or whether it'd be easier to serve a heavily accented crowd of unexpected tourists, who also (by mistake) turn out to be 8 inches tall and very hard to hear.

Cheers!

		<div class="commentbody">Denis, I share David’s sense that this moves the discussion forward, especially in the characterization of W.

However, I can’t be confident either that each of your three manipulations affects only one of the three sources of word information in the text.

My holistic process — let’s call holistic: H — involves more than your W. Your W is my holistic process’s <em>parafoveal</em> component, which I think of in <em>ensemble-statistics</em> terms rather than <em>word-shape</em> terms. My holistic process H also has a <em>foveal</em> component. The foveal component of my H is letter-feature based, but transgraphemic, or letter-boundary transgressing. In other words, it relies on location, identity and direct association information existing at the granularity of letter parts and evoked forms, but it doesn’t rely on channeling that information into independent letter slots. Instead of channeling information into slots my foveal H-process samples letter-parts and evoked form information simultaneously from all locations within the whole. The whole is considered as a bounded map of letter-parts and evoked forms, that is, as a bounded map of blacks and whites. (Channeling can however be successful in alternating case.)

This is like your “one-step assembly (features to word),” except that the “features” the assembly of ensemble statistics — your W — relies on are probably of a different order than those which are available to foveal vision.

My foveal H-process description uses ideas about feature-analytic processing developed by Frank Smith in his 1967 dissertation; ideas about pattern-unit processing developed by Neal Johnson prior to 1979, and ideas about identification matrices developed by Richard Golden in 1986.

In my scheme parafoveal pre-processing — your W — facilitates but doesn’t replace the foveal component of my H. In other words. I’m not convinced that your W process <em>is</em> actually “common to both central and peripheral vision.”

So here we have not one, but two, two sources for H, and together they provide an alternative processing path, not an additive compliment, to L — or so it seems to me.

When the foveal component of my H fails in the silent substitution paradigm, the perceptual processing system tries L. The letter-based identification mechanism isn't absent here, but the L-mechanism has to contend with misleading letter cues, so makes allowances for the possibility of substitutions, slowing sense-following down dramatically.

The only condition in which the foveal component of my H-process <em>doesn’t</em> encounter problems is with normal upper and lower case.

I wonder what this does to your analysis.

Interestingly, I discovered while trying to read your paper with partially fogged-up glasses, I could read the L-knockout text with remarkable ease and accuracy. When my glasses cleared up the L-knockout text again became very tough-going. </div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Hello Dennis, 

I have been discussing Peter’s theory with him for some time, and have come up with some experiments to test it against the current received views which Peter calls ‘slot processing’. These are tests of ‘gestalt’ effects that are different from those you have so far identified, as Peter notes above. Kevin Larson has also expressed some interest in these experiments being carried out.
 
In order to understand the ‘gestalt’ effects that Peter writes about, it has helped me to put this in terms of a model that captures at least some features of his ideas, and makes it easier for me to think about the issues. Let me explain the model, and then the experiments.  

The model I call a ‘matrix-resonance’ model. The idea here is that visual processing will identify sub-letter features, and place them into a structure similar to positions in a number matrix, as in matrix algebra. The position in such a word matrix would indicate spatial relations to other features in the word. Sub-letter features would be coded in some way like "left ascender" or "counter open on the right", and would have an indicator of spatial position in relation to other features. 

Now sub-matrices can be ‘read’ out in matrix algebra by multiplying the matrix with another matrix that has a bunch of zeros in the appropriate places. Similarly, the features in a word matrix could be analyzed into letter matrices, and identified as letters. And I think that in fact happens. 

But simultaneously, in parallel processing, and following Peter’s ideas, I think a whole word matrix ‘resonance’ process is going on. If a single pitch tone rings out in a room it will ‘paint’ vibrations over the whole room, but only a lampshade that is ‘tuned’ to the right pitch will resonate. Similarly, I think that the brain simultaneously ‘paints’ the whole visual memory bank of word matrices, and if one matrix pattern stored in memory ‘resonates’ then that is immediately identified as semantically the right word.  And the process of resolution into letters is dropped, as the eye makes the next saccade.

Whether the matrix is read as a word or as letters depends on a number of factors. If the word is unfamiliar it will require the breakdown into letters. Also, if the reader has an attentional "set" to proofread, there will also be a breakdown into letters.  But generally, in my view, there is a bias favoring reading the matrix as a whole as a word. That is to say, the whole word matrix is sent to all the stored record of matrices of role units associated with semantic word meanings. And when it "resonates", to use my earlier metaphor, with the stored matrix then the meaning is checked as sensible in context, and the eye moves on--or at least doesn't back track.

The basic a priori argument for such a scheme is efficiency. After all people instantly recognize Chinese characters, where even the ‘radicals’ that make up other characters often have as many strokes as a short English word. Why shouldn’t the brain take advantage of this pattern recognition capacity, and bypass an elaborate ‘look up’ process? 

Furthermore, the matrix doesn't have to match memory exactly. There is probably some kind of partial resonance, which is good enough to pick out a word, so as long as there are not competing words that are 'rung' by the matrix. Thus wrong spelling, broken letters are not even noticed. 

The point about this model, which is supposed to articulate Peter’s theory—though he may not agree with all of it—is that word gestalt may be defined DIFFERENTLY from external word shape or just what is seen in the parafovea.  If this model has any validity, there is often not letter by letter processing, even though this kind of processing would fall in your “letter” category.
 
How would one test for the existence of such such a sub-letter feature word pattern view, verses a letter by letter parallel processing only?  I’ll explain the experiments in my next post, and why they are in fact likely to be sensitive to the kinds of issues types designers are typically focused on in their work.

Do all people instantly recognize Chinese characters? This is the parallel wheel upon which many of these experiments must also turn, whether the study likes it or not.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">So in the matrix-resonance model, we do parallel processing, but we are able to process and identify the word from patterns of sub-letter features across a whole word. We don’t always have to first resolve the sub-letter features into letters. That’s the basic point Peter has been arguing, and he convinced me of it after I was initially skeptical.

Being a former student of Popper, I knew the key issue in science is of devising tests, preferably crucial ones, for any theory; otherwise it’s not really part of science. The question I was wrestling with is: how in the world can you show that such processing is going on, given that if you can see the sub-letter features you can also see letters. 

After reading the part of Kevin Larson’s [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx|Science of Word Recognition]] article on the word superiority effect (WSE), I got an idea.  The word superiority effect shows up when sets of letters are flashed at a person, followed by flashing a “mask”,  typically a line of xxxx, to the observer.  The mask is supposed to stop visual processing, because it puts new information into the visual cortex, overwriting the old. The idea, of Reicher, was to study just  the visual processing. When you do this kind of test, it turns out that people are better at identifying letters in words than in non-words. 
 
So if the initial word flashed was ‘made’, people will be better at saying correctly that the correct missing letter in “ma_e” is a ‘d’ and not a ‘k’—better than if it were a non-word, such as “dmae” and you showed them “_mae” and gave them the alternatives d and k. As Kevin notes, this word superiority effect has always been the best argument for the existence some kind of word-gestalt effect, known on Typophile, thanks to Hrant and following Taylor & Taylor’s text on reading, as the ‘Bouma’ (rhymes with trauma :). 


Following Peter’s view, and my experience designing a typeface family, it seemed to me that if you more widely spaced—tracked out—the letters, this should at some point destroy the word superiority effect.  The idea is that the distances between the different letter parts in a word like “the” are important, and not only the relative distances between parts of individual letters. So increasing the spacing between letters would mess up the word-gestalt, or Bouma. Hence the WSE would vanish at greater spacing. And that would show that more than letter identification is important.

Now I told this to Kevin at TypeCon in Seattle, and he was interested. Then Peter did a literature search—and he has made an amazingly broad and deep study of the reading science literature—and found that indeed this test had actually been done—and I was right in my prediction, which had been based on Peter’s ideas. The WSE did go away with wide tracking. The original paper on spacing and the WSE was by Purcell, Stanovich, and Spector in 1978, with follow up articles by Holender in 1979 and Purcell and Stanovich in 1982. 

Now the fly in the ointment has been that mixed-case words liKE this ExAMpLe also show a word superiority effect. This led almost all researchers around 1980 to think that the WSE was some kind of memory and guessing effect, not a word gestalt effect, and to adopt the view that reading is totally by letter processing in parallel, with no trans-letter effects. However, as Peter pointed out to me, in these mixed-case tests there was a significantly time between the showing of the group of letters or word and the showing of the ‘mask’. This time lapse is known by the awkward term “stimulus onset asynchrony “ (SOA).


My conclusion has been that there are two WSE effects. One is influenced by orthography, and kicks in with longer exposure to the letters (longer SOAs). The other is more a word gestalt effect that is clear at short times, before the information goes further up the processing chain. This goes with my ‘matrix-resonance’ model, explained in the first post. 


So based on this idea, I predict that with longer exposure to the letters, the word superiority effect will re-appear even with the widely spaced letters. –Or to make it sound much more impressive: the WSE will reappear at longer SOAs :)  This will establish that there is a WSE that is due to word gestalt effects, as well as one due to memory effects. In other words, this will show that the typographer’s distinction between legibility of individual letters and readability of text is valid. Or in other words, the Bouma rides again :)

Now I should emphasize that the word gestalt effects here are not simply the word outline, or what can be seen blurrily in the parafovea, which you, Denis have tested for. This, I supposed is a gain in skipping words and in knowing where to plant a fixation, based on information gained in the parafovea. But there is much more to word-gestalt processing than this, if Peter is right, and if my model has any validity. 


This is only one experiment, and I would propose a series involving the kinds of things that type designers are concerned with. These I’ll post next.

		<div class="commentbody">Before I get to more experiments, a couple of responses:

David, I left out a comma. It should be: "After all, people instantly recognize Chinese characters." Also I shouldn't have written 'instantly', which is an exaggeration. I meant that proficient readers of Chinese can recognize them probably as quickly as we recognize letters. I don't know about tests of this though. 

I am also aware that most Chinese characters are composed of two to four sub-characters. However, even the sub-characters (radicals) often have more strokes than a short English word. The point is that these basic characters are not modular in the way that alphabetic words are, and yet there is extremely rapid recognition. Of course we also very rapidly recognize faces, which are far more complex than letters. The basic point is that we humans have immense powers of pattern recognition. I don't see why our brain would forgo using them while reading. It seems to me it would prefer the seemingly quicker path of recognizing the word from the word pattern of sub-letter features, as Peter has argued and my model elaborates. 

Denis, from the point of view of Peter's theory, and my model, with letter substitution you are not preserving 'whole word reading' and knocking out letter reading. You are just preserving whole word reading in the parafovea. In the fovea letter substitution knocks out the pattern of sub letter features. Thus by letter substitution you are completely defeating the kind of whole word reading that Peter thinks is going on routinely. 

What you are doing with alternate case is quite different: forcing parallel processing of letters. You report that Frank Smith found that alternating case slows reading by 21%. That 21% may indicate in fact the difference between the efficiency of on one hand using word-pattern reading plus advance information from parafovea gains, and on the other hand using parallel processing. There could in normal reading conceivably be no word recognition by parallel processing of letters at all. The word patterns may always be winning out. Now I would not go that far, but the point here is that you are not testing for the kind of whole word reading that Peter theorizes exists and that my model represents. 

Crucial tests are crucial in that they hit one theory and not another in their results. But these tests miss addressing Peter's view, and my model. 

Incidentally, in Peter's view, historically the abandonment of word gestalt approaches around 1980 was based on the mistake of thinking that all there was to a gestalt view was the external outline of the word. According to Peter, people such as Frank Smith and Hermann Bouma were struggling with richer views, though these never got clearly developed. 

I'll defer description of my further experiments testing Peter's view and my model until my next post.   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'll just chime in regarding William's point about people recognizing Chinese characters on the character level.

Like many Koreans of my generation, I'm generally horrible with Chinese characters, as Chinese characters have been largely phased out of day-to-day usage in Korean. I can read a lot more than I can write, and I can vaguely recognize a whole lot more than I can recognize with certainty.

I can recognize the character 特 for instance, but wouldn't be able to recall how to write it. Also, I might vaguely recognize a character like 寶, but I wouldn't be able to tell if a few minor strokes were changed around as long as the overall pattern was not too different.

Clearly I'm not reading these characters by looking at their modular components—I don't even necessarily know what these are. I'm "reading" these characters by (vaguely) recognizing their overall shapes and pattern, not by looking at the details.

I get the sense that reading happens mostly on a level above that of the individual letters when I read texts in other scripts, but with Chinese characters it really is obvious.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, here are some additional tests showing the presence of word-gestalt reading, in the manner suggested by Peter and in accord with my model, using the Word Superiority Effect. 

First, instead of simply spreading the letters out by tracking more widely, I would suggest doing irregular spacing of letters, accordion-like. In his book "While You're Reading" Gerard Unger has an example like that, and I think it will destroy the Word Superiority effect even more effectively than wider spacing. 

Second, I would try whiting out portions of all the letters in a good text font, but leaving default spacing and everything else alone. I would predict that the WSE will be even more dramatic in these cases. People will be able to read words on the basis of the partial letters present, but have a much more difficult time with identifying letters in non-words. I think this would be a particularly dramatic demonstration of the way the brain uses sub-letter features across a word to get a word image. 

Third, I would keep spacing the same, but mess up the rhythm of the type face by having some very wide letters, such as very circular bdeopq, along with very narrow ones. I think that will also mess up the WSE. In fact the (horrible for text) typeface "University Roman" already does that. But I would take one of those faces with a lot of widths--such as David Berlow has produced--and mix up widths. 

Fourth, I would randomly alternate regular and bold weights within the same word. Again, I think this may disrupt the WSE. 

Fifth, I would compare the effect of gradually wider tracking with very round faces, like Helvetica, with ones based on the oval, such as Meta. I think that in order to get good word image very wide and round faces, particularly sans, they have to be spaced too close, and this causes crowding that hurts readability. This may affect the WSE. 

In fact I would also test the same spacing disruption with a good sans and serif of similar width (equalizing for x-height), and see if that affects the WSE. My theory is that it is hard or impossible to get the balance of word image and wide enough spacing for legibility with a sans compared to a serif. This might show up in the WSE. 

These issues of even color and good rhythm are ones that good type designers are concerned with. David Berlow has talked about them as enabling type to "disappear" as the reader is reading. They may only make a difference of less than 5% to reading, but that 5% may be the difference between screen and print, or between a good text font and a bad one. 

Finally, let me say that I do expect that such disruptions will show themselves in ease of reading, where by 'ease' I mean a combination of reading speed and comprehension over time. 

These factors may not show up with easy materials for a short time, because the reader may be able to adjust for mildly adverse situations. However, if eg you have a series of SAT reading questions for people to do over a 3 hour period, with the goal to be getting as many right as possible, answering all, then I think you will get a measure of reading ease. The worse face for texts type, or the worse the combination of setting and type, the worse will be the performance. Also I would expect reports of fatigue. 

Kevin has pointed to a 1948 book were there was no decline in reading performance over time, but this hasn't been repeated, and I suspect the methodology was flawed.

		<div class="commentbody">More from me. I stumble over the idea that Pelli and Tillman’s dissociations reveal indepenent reading processes, which each contribute a given number of words.

I wonder if it would be less troublesome to say that Pelli and Tillmans manipulations measure three interacting factors rather than three independent processes. Reinterpreting Pelli and Tillman, could we say effective role-unit quantization is the largest factor in determining reading speed, grammaticality plays an important role, and interfacilitation comes in third. Ease of quantization into role-units accounts for about 61 percent, grammaticality accounts for about 22 per cent, and the affordance of interfacilitation within the quantization process accounts for the rest, about 18 percent.

I doubt if it’s quite that simple though, because the knockouts Pelli and Tillman use introduce various bottlenecks. For example, alternating case probably introduces two: a componental abstraction — separate integrations over distinct areas — bottleneck (which probably affects attentional effort), and a sophisticated guessing bottleneck (which probably causes more reliance on grammaticality).

If they are interacting factors, changing levels of grammaticality or levels of interfacilitation affordance should change the amount of role-unit quantization required.

[Interfacilitation: when the visual cortex sees role a (for example a bowl or stem) at position x within a full bounded map, role b at position y, and role c at position z, this may facilitate a more accurate and quicker decision about what exists at position w.]

[role units are things like strokes and counters. They are elements of intermediate complexity, existing between simple features (like curvature, or abscence of closure) and letters (which in the word context are identifiable as parts). Some studies purport to show  that intermediate complexity features are optimal for the basic visual task of the classification of wholes.]


[quantization is my name for the process that moves from detection of simple features to discrimination of distinctive role-units. I use quantization because this process is not purely bottom-up. It is driven by learned perceptual knowledge of these structures of intermediate complexity]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry to be so slow responding. I was hounded by reminder letters for overdue reviews. They’re now done. Phew! 

<strong>David “dberlow” (Nov. 15):</strong> <em>“Fabulous!”</em> Thanks! 
<em>“This is done by … alternating case in words. I cannot help but think this is over-doing it.”</em> You are certainly right in noting that there are subtler ways of disturbing word shape. (I like your suggestion of alternating case using small instead of large caps.) However, your concern does not apply to the needs of our paper. We estimate the value of the process (word shape) by how much the reader slows down when we knock it out. The finding, surprising to some, is that knocking out word shape causes only a small reduction in reading rate. Thus, the fact that we used a really brutal method (alternating case) yet still had only a small effect makes our result all the more convincing. Thus, given the conclusion that our paper was arguing for, it is helpful to err on the side of “overdoing it”. (If we had obtained the opposite result then it would be have been desirable to go back and try something subtler, such as you suggest.)

Sorry, I could not figure out what you’re referring to as <em>“S&S’s study”</em>.

<strong>Peter “eene_son” (Nov. 15, 17)</strong>: <em>“this moves the discussion forward”</em>. Great. Thanks!

<em>“However, I can’t be confident that each of your three manipulations affects only one of the three sources of word information”</em>
Our paper gives reasoning and evidence to reach this conclusion. To challenge the conclusion you have to challenge the evidence or the reasoning. Simply describing another theory has no bearing. The reason that we give for concluding that the knockouts were selective is that the effect (in word/min) of each knockout on reading rate was the same, independent of whether the other knockouts were present or not. 

<em>“Interestingly, I discovered while trying to read your paper with partially fogged-up glasses, I could read the L-knockout text with remarkable ease and accuracy. When my glasses cleared up the L-knockout text again became very tough-going.”</em>
Wow! That is very interesting. I’ll try that myself. Thanks!

<em>“I wonder if it would be less troublesome to say that Pelli and Tillmans manipulations measure three interacting factors rather than three independent processes.”</em>
Is your theory consistent with our data? That would be very interesting.

<strong>Bill “William Berkson” (Nov. 15-17):</strong> I like your matrix-resonance theory. It puts all the elements together in a novel way. And I also like, very much, that you propose experiments to test it. However, as you may already have noticed, suggesting a new experiment is a bit like suggesting a new typeface. It is very unusual for a type designer to create a new face that somebody else suggested (unless, of course, it’s a client paying for the privilege). Similarly, scientists usually do their own experiments. If you want to create a new typeface or do a new experiment, usually, you have to do it yourself. However, for pilot data, it can be quite informal, just printing a few sheets and taking simple measures that don’t require any fancy equipment. 

As for the Word Superiority Effect, I agree with you and Kevin when you say, <em>“this word superiority effect has always been the best argument for the existence of some kind of word-gestalt effect”</em>. However, that was before my paper on this (Pelli et al. 2003). We replicated the effect, but presented a mathematical analysis showing that the effect is not big enough to be compelling evidence for a word-based process. The effect can be accounted for by a letter-based process. No one has contested our conclusion, so the word-superiority effect (of the typical size measured) is no longer good evidence for a word-based process. I’m afraid this reduces the impact of the elegant word-superiority-effect experiments you proposed here.

I think that the results presented in that paper are consistent with your matrix-resonance theory. Our results indicate that the word is not just one feature, nor is a letter, the features must be smaller than a letter. Which agrees with your theory.

However, we have another, later, paper showing that the word cannot be recognized unless the letters are separated (Martelli et al. 2005). This is the “crowding” effect that Peter has mentioned several times. I don’t think that your matrix-resonance theory can cope with these data, because, according to your theory, the break between letters should not matter.

<em>“Thus by letter substitution you are completely defeating the kind of whole word reading that Peter thinks is going on routinely. … you are not testing for the kind of whole word reading that Peter theorizes exists and that my model represents.”</em>
Yes, that’s right. We were not aware of your theories at that time. But I think that the Martelli et al. paper above presents strong evidence against the matrix-resonance model. Letters do matter.

When you say, “a series of SAT reading questions”, what does “SAT’ stand for? Speed-accuracy tradeoff? Scholastic aptitude test?

I’ll respond to your fatigue theory in my next post.

		<div class="commentbody">Denis, thanks much for your reply. 

Obviously, I will have to read your papers that you reference to see whether or not I find your tests and arguments convincing. That will probably take me some time, as I have a crush of other work to deal with right now. 

I would just note at the outset that the matrix-resonance model I suggested does not dictate how much of reading is by letters and how much by word pattern of sub-letter features; it just allows that some of it is. I don't know how much of it is, but I do think that there is at least enough to be of importance to the issues dealt with by type designers. 

As David Berlow mentioned, either in this thread or another recent one, whether the foundry can close the sale of a font to publications often depends on type designer creating type that becomes 'invisible' when you read it. 'Invisible' means that you are unaware of the type for most of the time reading, and just absorb the meaning. There are also intervals when you orient yourself on the page, looking at headlines, first lines etc., and there you do 'see' the type, and aesthetics have a strong impact in these intervals.  

The factors that contribute to 'invisibility' include even color, good spacing, and letter proportions that have good rhythm. These may affect reading speed or fatigue only by a few percent, but it is enough to make the difference between good and bad type, or between the relatively low resolution screen and high resolution printed matter. 

There a possible confounding factor here on the issue of word-gestalt vs letter reading, and that is that these factors may allow for more ready letter identification. But the word superiority effect may allow us to separate what is going on, which is why I suggested those experiment. Again, I'll have to read your papers to see whether I'm still optimistic about this being an indicator.

I would point out, as you reply to Peter, that you reference an alternative theory and experiments, but do not account here attempt to respond to and account for the Stanovich et al results that I "predicted", namely the decay of the word superiority effect with greater spacing. Stanovich himself dismissed it (in a rather ad hoc manner IMHO) as being somehow due to confounding effects of masking. Going to longer exposure times--long SOAs--would undermine this masking explanation, if I've got it right. Whatever the truth is about reading, it needs to account for the spacing effect. By the way, Kevin is on your side in being skeptical about the WSE indicating anything important; but he has been open-minded enough to think it's worth testing, and I'm grateful for that. 

Oh, I see I also failed to mention another indicator of ease of reading, other than speed and comprehension: how easy it is to proof-read a text and catch errors. That's a noticeable difference between screen and print, as most people can testify.    

Yes, by SAT I meant the Scholastic Aptitude Test. These reading tests are already standardized as regards difficulty, and are pretty tough, so they would be used to test whether speed or comprehension or both decay with time, and hence fatigue, using different type and formats.

I think such tests would be revealing, as I don't think there have been really good tests of the 'goodness' of text type for reading, to discriminate better and worse type, and better and worse layout. This is really a different testing issue than letter vs word processing, though it may be related.

As to what scientists do, your description is not quite accurate. A lot of scientists collaborate on tests that others conceive, including very often junior ones with a senior professor. Collaboration with colleagues on an equal level is also not that uncommon. Collaboration with someone outside academia is unusual, but there's actually no law against it :) </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Denis, my first response questioned whether, under a different — and I think fuller or richer — account of reading, the knockouts you propose — straight-forward though they seem — are properly selective, or at least selective in the way you say they are, and consequently whether they lead to pure additive-factor measures of the processes you say they do. My second reply was to suggest that your results might indeed be compatible with — or at least potentially informative about — components of such an alternative point of view.

Bill, assuming a purely sub-letter feature based process is routine for skilled readers reading ordinary extended blocks of text, and is the key to invisibility during immersive reading, it would be useful to know not only how much, but under what circumstances a letter-process (componental abstraction) occurs.

Denis, I'll try to respond to your comment about the Martelli et. al. paper presenting strong evidence against the matrix-resonance model in a day or so.</div>

...over a six word span, using attention deflecting mid-word uppercase letters which are usually found seeking attention for recognition of specific mid-word caps. :) The more brutal the methods used to "enlighten" the process, the less likely you are to reach a conclusion that matches <em>our</em> results, which is, after all the "experimentation" is over, what counts to actual readers of actual text. 

I should also add, that the letter-<em>only</em> recognition camp, has used this kind of study to justify  technologies afflicting millions of users with both bad letter shapes and bad letter spacing. So, there may be a lot to what you say, but when the words pile up and the resolution sinks, your studies become less useful to readers, and apparently useless to us. For when bad type and typography, that well below the norms produced by trained type and graphic designers, are the starting points for reading studies, we can not only shrug.

My way of saying this might be, “the finding is that forcing the visual cortex to use the alternative letter-by-letter path causes a significant (18 percent) reduction in reading rate.

But I expect there will be other costs: a significant increase in the attentional effort required, and a subsequent decline in ease of sense-following.

This would all make sense if fast reading depends on <em><strong>resisting</strong></em> <strong>isolating</strong> to identify, and, instead, relies on <em><strong>promoting</strong></em> a direct, foveally-based <strong>compounding</strong> of featural and configural information all across the bounded map. 

Again, featural here means: ‘role-unit’ and ‘evoked-form’ information, or strokes and counters information. Configural information can be of two sorts, first order and second order. First order configural information is direct association or local combination information about role relationships — for example, if and where a bowl combines with an ascending or descending stem. Second order configural information is more global relational information — for example, whether the counters form a sequential circular / tubular-and-open-at-the-top / circular and-open-to-the-right pattern, or some other pattern.

In the sense that first order configural information is compiled, letters matter, or are used.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Much respect to Pelli & Tillman for their work, which has produced fascinating results.

However, I think their procedure underestimates the effect of context (S).

The premise that "We tend to read by serial object recognition", and the subsequent use of RSVP, are off the mark.
If we read, as P&T say, by "a series of fixations, rather than a continuous sweep" (quantum, not wave?), this is at odds with their experiments, which employ a method that constrains the reader into a passive mode analagous to a continuous sweep of single words.

Reading uses serial fixations as an active process, saccadic movements (with significant regressions) probing long tracts of text, often skipping words. 

How does the reader decide where to make each next fixation?
From information perceived in the parafovea. So reading proceeds by saccadic probing, directed by lexical analysis (fuzzy logic) of parafoveal information.

This is "W" and "S" processing, which is "knocked out" by the RSVP method, so how can meaningful conclusions be made about the role of S (context) in particular, if the participant's ability to actively incorporate it by saccadic probing is denied, with visual contextual awareness restricted to a single letter on each side of the word at hand?

Given that fast readers spend less time in fixations, and have less regressions, we can deduce that expert readers are better interpreters of parafoveal information, i.e. "S", context.

This is consistent with the way one learns to read, moving up from parts of letters to syllables, to words, &c. &c. 

P & T's concept of "context" is lexical, not visual, and does not account for one's awareness, during normal reading, of text in blocks. Typographic layout, if you will. 

It seems to me that the operant space-time dimension of reading is much larger than a few words. Multiply the 2.5 to 3 second span of consciouness by the number of saccadic movements per second, and we have about twelve saccades in play, two of which, on average, are regressive. I theorize that in the moving window, which encompasses a good long sentence, the reader creates a perceptual construct--a dynamic grammatical image propelled by the meaning it divulges--using the culmulative "spatial mapping" associated with saccadic movement to organize the fine details at the centre of fixations, and the fuzzier information in between, into a coherent semiotic whole, realized in notanic (Cartesian) space. 

What kind of saccadic movement occurs during RSVP? It doesn't turn off, so it would seem to be "regressive", in the sense that it would attach itself to lower level reading functions, focusing on letter details. </div>

Bad type, bad lighting, bad printing, blotty paper, water stains, poor spelling, all lowercase, texting shortcuts, bad handwriting, torn pages, don't prevent us from reading. I think the human perception/reception/comprehension is pretty amazing and functions extremely well. I wonder if we make too much out of reading studies and assume there is a problem that is type related when there is not?

It might be easier to think of a regressive saccade as looking at something you’ve looked at before, rather than a eye movement that isn’t left-to-right. When looking around the world during non-reading activities you fixate on objects 3 to 4 times a second. Sometimes your eyes move to the left, sometimes to the right, sometimes in just about the same location (though with a slight movement). A regressive movement here could be to the left or right depending on where you just looked. RSVP eye movements aren’t left to right because the words stay in roughly the same place, but they’re not regressive eye movements because new words appear.

That's what the data says, within the closed loop of the test, which considers S (context) to be lexical, rather than visual.

In other words, in RSVP the contextual S component of the reader's closure on the meaning of the word being viewed is based purely on the lexical meaning of words previously read, not, as in "real" reading, using information from the full space-time visual awareness the reader has of the text: approximately 12 saccades, and a considerable amount of typography.

So, knocking out lexical context is not the same as knocking out visual context, even if they ARE both knocked out in RSVP.
It might have meaning within the closed loop of the RSVP test, but what does that tell us about the role of S in real reading?

How to explain the greater speed of RSVP?
In RSVP results, "S" accounts for 22% of reading rate. In normal reading, the percentages may be different. If the values of L, S, and W are indeed additive, lets assume that the 60% slowdown of normal reading is produced by more time spent on S--now the values of L and S become almost identical.

One thing the difference in speed between normal reading and RSVP might suggest is that the extra time, in normal reading, devoted to awareness of a larger visual field of text, shows how important visual context it is to "smooth sense-following", when reading is considered as more than just "object recognition". 

<em>RSVP eye movements aren’t left to right because the words stay in roughly the same place, but they’re not regressive eye movements because new words appear.</em>

Sorry for the confusion over "regressive"; I meant that looking at details of letters, rather than whole words, was "regressive", in the sense that it harks back to how one learns to read. Can't resist word play.

Thank, you Chris. This is what I have been saying for years.

I am interested to understand how we read, and hence in studies of reading. But the fact that it is difficult to determine everything that is involved in reading shouldn't make us think that reading is difficult, let alone that there is a pathology of type design. 'Readability' is not the product of reading studies, it is the prerequisite subject of study.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, the purpose of reading studies is to understand reading. If its mechanism is better understood, it may help those with dyslexia, as well as shed light on many other issues, including those concerning type.  

I don't think that many reading studies focus on type--quite the contrary.

However, I am of the opinion that there are small but still significant differences in readability due to type design and layout design. Scientific research can potentially shed light on these variables, though it hasn't done much so far. 

Denis, you write about my matrix-resonance model: 

"I don’t think that your matrix-resonance theory can cope with these data, because, according to your theory, the break between letters should not matter."

This is absolutely not a correct characterization of my theory. The separation of letters is on my theory vitally important because the sub-letter features have to be detectable by the eye for the ensemble pattern to be recognized. I expect that either too much crowding or too much spacing will destroy the Word Superiority effect. Optimal spacing--within a certain range--is important to readability. 

In my view type lays down a grid, roughly twice as fine as the 'n', and our perceptual apparatus has been trained to pick up salient sub-letter features falling on and deviating from the grid. Further, as Peter has related to me, there have been Fourier transforms done on pictures of type that confirm the presence of such regular, but not exact, frequency of features. In effect we type designers have to 'tune' our letters to get it right! And honestly, that's how it feels in making decisions on letter width and proper spacing. 

Indeed, in Peter's view spacing for good readability of type is actually at an interval where crowding would normally make object identification in the fovea more difficult. The key thing is the play of type forms against the grid, and the matching of that to the inner matrix. 

I haven't had time to study your papers that you think refute the importance of the Word Superiority Effect, though Peter doesn't think they do this--he will post later on this no doubt. As will I, but it will be a while, alas. 

Happy Thanksgiving all!</div>

I didn't say that there were. The problem is that the few that do have an impact far beyond the intension of the scientists doing the study--as well as getting more attention then they deserve from editors and clients who become armed and dangerous. We have beat this discussion to death many times here so I won't persue it any further and get the cannons roaring again.

		<div class="commentbody">John, you ask: "How are we defining 'significant'?"

Basically, if it shows up subjectively that readers consistently find it more comfortable to read one in extended text rather than another, that is a good enough test for me. Subjective self-reports would be good enough. It would be necessary to design the questionnaire so that the subjects judge reading experience--and the results are not confounded by report on the type as display or pet theories of the reader. 

And, by the way, I think you could show a difference in subjective result pretty easily by, for example, reducing leading way beyond what is ordinarily acceptable.  

Of course, I would prefer to have more objective measures that correlate with the subjective ones. For example, the fatigue test I mentioned above--or a test for ease of detecting typos, which I also mentioned. In extreme cases, it might show up simply in reading speed in a relatively short period.  

For example many people report they don't like reading extended text on screen, and they also find it easier to proof what they have written in print. The subjective report is significant to me, and I think it would be easy to test the relative errors in proofing. </div>

One of the reasons I have avoided getting heavily involved in this thread is that I don't think it is clear what the discussion is about. On the one hand, the original post referenced 'improved reader experience', and on the other hand it referenced 'legibility', and seened to presume a correlation that has not been defined.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I do think this thread has covered some new ground, so I hope you'll bear with us.

Also, as I said before, a tabulation of the perceptual processing impact of manipulating type-form microvariables is maddeningly elusive. So I'm not as confident as Bill that we'll soon be able to gauge specific impacts. I think John is quite right in implying that pure and simple readability is a fairly wide plateau. I’ve used the plateau image before, but it actually comes from reading Denis Pelli and his associates. The image is of a steep rise, than a wide plateau followed by a gradual decline. This is where I'd look for impacts: where the steep rise starts; where does the plateau sit; how wide is it?

Thirdly, some readers might find little practical benefit in arguing about whether reading is wholistic in some sense, or by parts. But to me what's at stake is the self-understanding of typographers and type designers in what they're doing. If reading is holistic in the sense Bill and I elaborate, then there are functional, perceptual processing reasons for type designers to do what they are doing to guarantee the gestalt integrity in optical terms of the words their letters are to form. A by parts view gives a much less clear picture of why this might be important from a ‘perceptual processing in reading’ point of view, so the ‘tuning’ obsessiveness of type designers becomes an aesthetically fetishistic tribal quirk.

Finally, Denis: despite some reservations, I think the reasoning in the Martelli, et. al., paper is basically sound, if and only if isolation to identify provides the only release from crowding. I think you may be right about this when it comes to paravoveal vision, but for foveal vision I think the idea of Hess that “in flanking conditions where contour interaction is evident, the visual system shifts it scale of analysis to more relevant higher spatial frequencies” might be of some use. If the shift in spatial scale of analysis to more relevant higher spatial frequencies also relieves crowding we are back into the domain to Bill’s Matrix Resonance model. The shift fails in parafoveal vision, because the parafovea only supports coarse sampling, but can succeed in foveal vision, where the density of receptor cells is much higher.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, I think there are some very clear issues here. I myself find lengthy posts here--such as mine!--difficult to read on screen, and prefer to print them out. And I know I proof read less well on the screen. I have heard many others report the same thing. This is a reality, and a good theory of reading should be able to account for it. Do you deny that these things are a reality?

In pioneering research in psychology it is often not clear exactly what concept will be useful in building a theory. As experiments are done, that can be clarified. For example I have heard that the "introvert/extrovert" scale has held up pretty well as a testable and real phenomenon, while other concepts from the early 20th century have not held up so well. 

If you refuse to investigate something because it is not yet operational, then you block scientific progress. For me, my late Uncle Ben Lieberman's definition of readability is sufficiently clear to try to make it more operationally testable: "Readability is the ease with which the eye can absorb the message and move along the line." This contrasted with "Legibility is the ease with which one letter can be told from another." And that has an illustration moving from a b to an old style italic h, with the foot turned in, to a roman h.

Herman Bouma defined legibility (1979) as "the technical quality of the text close to the centre of vision." For him this includes both the quality of the symbols proper (sharpness, type, font, size, luminous contrast with background) and such layout factors as distances between lines.”  He writes, “[p]roper guidance of the eye along and between the lines requires suitable margins, vertically aligned line beginings, and interline distances more than 3-4 percent of line length.“ And he continues, “[l]egibility factors are sufficiently know both in graphic design and in psychology: what seems lacking are thorough checks on such information and a translation in terms of rules of thumb and quick standard experiments to make the proper notions generally applicable.”

Bouma then goes on to say, “[t]he quality of the content of a text is usually referred to as “readability” and includes ease of comprehension.”

We might want to parse this differently, but in terms of discussions between typophiles and psychophiles it gives us a reasonable point at which to jump in.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Peter, you're right that "readability" is often used to refer to the quality of the writing, of how easy it is understand quite apart from graphic qualities. I think in using 'eye' Lieberman was metaphorically trying to indicate that whatever the graphic qualities of the text contribute to ready comprehension, that is "readability" in the context of type design and graphic design. Here what is referred to is a combination of speed, comprehension and comfort that come from graphic qualities. Now that concept is very broad, but it still is clearly distinguished from 'distinguishing one letter from another'. 

The important issue here is that there is more to the graphic side of ease of reading than the ability to recognize individual letters. That I think is the same issue you and and I and many type designers differ from the current view of most reading psychologists. </div>

Are you on Mac or PC? 

Slightly more seriously:
Let's suppose that younger people, such as the 17-25 year olds in the P & T research, don't have your screen-reading problem.
How could one know whether the effect is caused by physiological aging, or by cultural and technological changes? (On the principle that such reading preferences are performance factors that are hard-wired during the learning process.)

I suppose it could be theorized that the room for evolution in reading norms occurs in the margin of error of scientific data.

In any event, reading theory that doesn't account for demographics...

		<div class="commentbody">It took me years to identify the pattern.  I've always been a big reader, but then my paper reading almost dropped off to nothing.  Most of that had been fiction.

What I didn't recognize until later is that I'm still reading just as much, if not more, but now most of that's on the screen.  Wikipedia, blogs, forums.

Now, I'm young, and so I've grown up having both screen and paper to read, but when it comes to types of reading I certainly have a very well defined preference.

It's brutal so try to sit through a fiction book, but I can't read a book on a screen.

For informative writing, like how-tos or step-by-step articles, I have to have it on the computer (no recipe books here).

For news and magazines, must be paper. (although I do skim PDF magazines and really enjoy those visually, bt I look at them, instead of reading them.

On screens I prefer sans-serifs, and on paper I prefer serifs.  I'm not sure of any underlying reason why, or if others are like me or it's just a personal preference, but I hope this information helps.

I we want to think of readability as a typographic measure, and express it in a way science can use, we should at a minimum explicitly tie it to my foundational mechanism, or an alternative to it, distinguishing between type-1 and type-2 readability.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Denis, to add to my previous comment to you. From a follow-up to Hess, I learned letters are broad band stimuli that require integration across spatial frequencies. The Hess, et. al., paper is “The foveal ‘crowding’ effect: physics or physiology?” Robert F. Hess, Steven C. Dakin, Neil Kapoor (2000); the follow-up in question is “Efficient integration across spatial frequencies for letter identification in foveal and peripheral vision.” Anirvan S. Nandy and  Bosco S. Tjan (2008). 

My tests with fourier transforms reveal, however, that classically readable types, spaced according to long-established typographical standards reveal a very specific sort of narrow phase alignment, especially in the horizontal direction, where the vertical stems and the vertical parts of curves lie. This suggests to me that visual tuning to this narrow phase alignment channel at the granularity of strokes might be important in normal immersive reading, whereas categorical perception in letter tasks depends more on integration <em>across</em> frequencies. 

Testing spatial tuning in letter identification versus immersive reading tasks, and correlating this with WSE results for when phase alignment is normal and disturbed, might confirm whether or not narrow phase alignment might indeed be necessary for reading, and integration across spatial frequencies less critical than in letter tasks. This could add a lot of weight to my surmise about a shift to higher spatial frequencies relieving crowding, clearly dissociate ‘by parts’ processing and our version of holistic processing, and thus place matrix resonance back on the table, as I said before.

Adding to this is the recent find that “The visual cortical ‘word form area’ is selective for high spatial frequencies in humans but not monkeys” (Bilenko, Rajimehr, Young and Tootell, 2008)!</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">To follow up on Peter's point about the higher frequency of letter parts as opposed to letters, here is an experiment to test this. 

The model I am advocating is that the letter parts are fitting roughly on a grid, or a regular interval, about the width of the two sides of the n--rather than the advance width of an n, which would be the letter interval. The brains of proficient readers click onto that grid, and slot letter features into a mental matrix, as I described above. 

If that is so, then it is likely that the WSE would be destroyed more effectively by irregular spacing or irregular letter widths, as compared to simply tracking a word more widely or more tightly. In other words an   

a cc or dion   ef fec t    li k e    t hi s

will mess up word identification more than 

r e g u l a r          w i d e        s p a c i n g 

like that. (edit: the "smart" formatting of Typophile replaces multiple word spaces so I can't show it just as text here! I'll try to get to doing some GIFs soon.)  Examples like this are given in Gerard Unger's "While You're Reading."

So I think that the grid-matrix matching idea predicts that the WSE will be destroyed by irregular spacing, where the variations of the same amount, consistently applied, would not destroy the WSE by itself. So first we could take the visual angles at which Stanovich et al. got the WSE to vanish, then go below that until the WSE re-appears. Then we would use that unit irregularly, and that should destroy the WSE, even though it exists when that spacing is regular. 

We could also mess up the rhythm by expanding and condensing letters, and I think that would equally mess things up.

Further this could be checked against the Fourier transform pictures that give an objective measure of how much the grid is messed up, and how that correlates with the vanishing of the WSE. I think that would be powerful evidence of the importance of regular frequency.

Now you could still argue that regular frequency simply helps identify letters, though. But I think that doing the same tests with blanked-out letter parts will be the strongest argument for the matrix resonance model. Then irregularity of spacing will cause readability to immediately fall apart. This may even be evident even in raw reading speed. Our ability to read regularly spaced letters with missing parts--and not read well at all those with irregularly spaced or formed letters with missing parts--will show that there is something in the matrix resonance model. Irregular spacing should not be so much of a problem in letter identification, but it will be in word image built directly from letter parts. 

ps. Denis it just occurred to me that you could also do a kind of triple comparison somewhat similar to what you did in your recent paper: first regular reading speed, then letters with irregular spacing, then letters with sub-features blanked out, then letters with features blanked out and irregularity. It seems to me that the on the matrix resonance model you would expect that the reduction of speed for the combo of features blanked out plus irregularity would be greater than the sum of the irregular spacing of full letters and the blanked out letter parts only.

That wouldn't require the whole WSE testing stuff, maybe.

In writing 'letter features' I meant 'sub-letter features', such as joins, open counters in a left or right direction, ascender on the right or left, etc. 

Are you saying that we don't use a word pattern of sub-letter features, but first resolve into letters, as Denis favors? 

By 'grid' here I mean a fairly regular sequence of vertical elements, as well as elements falling near the base line or x-height. They deviate somewhat from regularity, which is where the information on what letter part or letter we are looking at comes from. I thought this was a view you advocated.

		<div class="commentbody">David, would it help to say that the receptive fields in the visual cortex are phasally tuned in relation to a task, so when visual information, black and white, in the horizontal dimension is narrowly phase aligned at the granularity of strokes and counters, it is easier to handle the information all at once and as a group with space-delimited boundaries, rather than by subdividing into independant processing cells?

I hate to inflict this on the practice, but when I take my type-practice/craft-wisdom-derived apriori’s into science, I see a massive disconnect. Type designers can probably work perfectly well without solving the disconnect, provided they are able to stay focussed and aren't knocked off course. My choice has been not to dismiss the science or lay it aside, but to try and work through the disconnect. Surely there is room for that. However, maybe I'm not the man for it. It’s labyrinthine, and I'm possibily delusional, or not knowledgable enough.

No one needs to watch, and maybe it’s important that they don't.

I interpret your attention to kerning and tuning strokes in relation to each other as fine-tuning proper salience, engineering distinctive cue-values and embedding a font and type-size specific phase alignment. Is this not of use? It’s not up to me to tell you how to acheive it. Just that this, in psychological, perceptual-processing terms, is a <em>functionally relevant</em> dimension of what your engagement with letters amounts to, and why.

Sorry, not nonsense, but I think it is not sensible to describe a model for a multi-script species that sounds so Latin script dependent. And Bill, when you propose to test anything by radically altering the spacing, I can't picture trying to get people to play chess after one has rearranged the squares into stripes.

Peter: "...it is easier to handle the information all at once and as a group with space-delimited boundaries, rather than by subdividing into independent processing cells?"
If it is easier to handle any information all at once rather than by subdividing into independant processing cells, don't you?

The original post is not the issues we're talking about though: "The theory is[...] find a point where the legibility is maximised, and then find the point where the aesthetics don’t negatively affect the legibility, then you can effectively improve the reader experience."
Legibility and aesthetics are not solved in that way, are they? Except for this pesky web thing, legibility and aesthetics are solved together, to a specific legibility and aesthetic, of a presentation method, for an audience. That's one of the few cool things that's different for me about going to the eye doctor, and believe me, I believe I am my ophthalmologists most entertaining patient.

I can't either, but that is what the test is supposed to show. Are you understanding the aim of the tests? 

The relative distances of the different letter sub-parts in a word in relation to each other are important in Peter's theory and my model, and not only the relation of letter sub-parts within a letter. The relative positions of parts within a letter, enabling letter identification, should be the only important thing according to the 'slot processing' view of Denis Pelli and others. 

The deterioration effect (dramatically slowing reading, destroying the WSE) of disruptive spacing thus contradicts 'slot processing', and shows the importance of 'gestalt' effects in reading words. Clear?

Finally, this is not specific to latin type. Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Chinese all have the modular, regular rhythm that I am talking about when I say "grid." I can also see it in South Asian scripts. I don't know about Arabic script, but I suspect the same is true for it.    </div>

That's a nice piece of lateral thinking, if I get your drift. In analytic contexts, I distinguish levels of functioning — like sense-following and visual word-form resolution —, or normative domains — like optical-grammatical integrity and gestural-atmospheric force —, while recognizing they are inextricably interwoven as you suggest when you say, “legibility and aesthetics are solved together, to a specific legibility and aesthetic, of a presentation method, for an audience.”

Functional constraints interact, and the claims imposed by distinct normative domains intersect to form a multidimensional workspace.</div>

But that is possible without recourse to the idea of a 'grid', which is what I think David and I object to in your model. Denis Pelli's work indicates a contributing role of word shape in reading (considerably less than the role of letter recognition, but still significant and, apparently and interestingly, additive: if word shape is messed with, the reduction in reading speed is predictably reduced). What is a word? It is a group of letters in proximity, separated by space from other groups: the relative distance of the proximity and the space is what defines a word (at least in our writing system). Pelli has published another study (I don't know if it is referenced in this thread, not all of which I have been able to read; Kevin Larsen showed it to me last week), in which the particular parts of letters necessary to recognition are identified, i.e. the parts without which users are unable to reliably recognise the letters (not many surprises in these results for me). So what we can presume contributes significantly to word recognition is these crucial parts of letters <em>in proximity</em>. I don't see that a 'grid' is a necessary or useful concept to add to that of proximity.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">John, you write "I don't see that a 'grid' is a necessary or useful concept to add to that of proximity."

The issue is the utility of a 'grid' over the whole word vs a 'grid' over just individual letters.  

We know that the brain is able to orient letter parts within some kind of grid. The relative orientations and distances of different parts of a letter are important to its recognition as a particular letter. For example, if we take the top intersection of a "b" and slide it up, it will "read" as a cap D. And if we rotate a "b" 180 degrees, it will read as a "q". So our brain has some way of coding distances and orientations that are on the printed page. 

Furthermore, these informational points consistently fall in certain places in the letter, such as x height and baseline--what I am calling the grid on the page. As you know that grid is actually on the screen when you design letters, and you take care as to where and how your letter parts fall in relation to that grid. Furthermore the rhythmic regularity of spacing and letter widths means that there is some approximate grid over the word also. 

So this is what I am talking about when I write of information in a 'grid' on the page being fit into a 'matrix' in the brain. 

The question I am putting, and I think my experiments will shed light on, is whether we are *directly* using information of the location of letter parts within one letter of a word in relation to parts within other letters in the word. By "directly" I mean without first resolving the letter parts into individual letters. 

In other words, question is whether the brain first resolves the letter parts in "the" into "t-h-e", identifying all the letters, and doing a look-up. This is the current received view, which Peter calls "slot processing". 

What Peter and I have been suggesting is that it is more efficient for the brain to directly recognize the whole pattern of sub-letter features within the word, without the interim step of identifying the letters. Thus the crossbar of the t next to the ascender of the h, next of the middle bar of the e would read semantically as 'the' without ever needing a process of individual letter identification and word look up.  

Now, there is no question but that our brain is capable of identifying such whole word patterns. As I mentioned, there are plenty of Chinese characters in which the parts are not meaningful on their own, and that have as many strokes as a short English word. And proficient Chinese readers have no problem in recognizing them in a flash. 

There is also no question whether we can do 'slot processing'; that fact that we can read mixed-case words shows that we can do letter identification and look up. But we also read such mixed case words 20% more slowly, as Denis reports above. So it is less efficient. Why is that?

Peter and I suggest that is because we read many words directly by the word pattern of sub-letter parts, and that this is more efficient, faster. That's why Peter's idea of pattern recognition, and my model is useful. It explains why mixed case reading is slower. It also explains why, as I anticipated on Peter's theory, the Word Superiority Effect disappears with spacing--the word pattern image is messed up, even while the individual letters are preserved. 

In my view, Peter's theory and my model will explain the results of the experiments I suggest, whereas the slot processing view will not.

If you and possibly David--though I don't know what he thinks--believe my theory is useless, please explain why the WSE disappears with extra spacing, and why reading mixed case is 20% slower, and how slot processing can explain the experiments I have proposed if they have the results I expect. 

Peter's and my theory would explain all these and slot processing would not, so far as I can see.

By all means wordspace, but not necessarily wordspace.

The same premise applies to every apparently hard facet of typography.
Sure, selectively remove parts of letters, and it looks like you've discovered which parts of letters are essential to reading.
But that just shows what conventions our culture has settled on, and the associated techniques that are hard-wired when we learn to read as children.
Depart from normal, and you slow down.

I am obviously talking about what constitutes a <em>visual</em> word in that system, not what constitutes a linguistic word. Of course there are other means that could be used to distinguish words, but they are not the means normally used in our writing system for more than a thousand years; nor do I think any of them provide as good readability. [The different weights for different words is particularly bad and, thanks to Denis Pelli, we now have a pretty good idea <em>why</em> it is bad: we have to adjust to different spatial frequencies for each word.]

Bill, I don't think your idea is useless by any means: I was querying your use of the term 'grid', which implies to me something much more regular than, perhaps, you mean. I've spent much of the past two days looking at <em>nasta'liq</em> text, so this might have influenced my reaction to the term 'grid'. But you seem to be using the term in a very loose way that seems not too different from my ideas of proximity and distance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, yes, I didn't mean that features need to fall exactly on a rigid grid. The "lines" on the grid are rather fuzzy bands. Frequency ranges might be more accurate. The important thing for my model is that there are expected regularities of where sub-letter features fall within a word and on the page. And the eye and brain have learned to spot and slot those features into mental matrices for words. 

The nature of a "model" such as I have suggested is that it is intended to have key structural features similar the reality of what is going on, and not that it is an actual accurate description. 

Nick, I don't see the relevance of the conventionality of writing; it's not an issue. There is no question but that shapes of the letters are conventional, not given by nature. The question is how our brain visually and cognitively processes these conventional signs in order to identify words and get meaning. What it can do more slowly and quickly can, I think, be a clue to what is going on mentally. </div>

Nick, experience with words causes a localizable area of the cerebral cortex to emerge as a Visual Word Form Area, so it's not just a matter of associating a biological mechanism too closely with a cultural convention. Moreover, the space between words allows the visual cortex to open up discrete 'object files' for what I've been referring to as bounded maps on the basis of information from parafoveal preview. This indexing of what is to come in the visual stream is the basis for the further processing that happens in foveal vision during a fixation, setting the bounds for the detailed featural or role-unit indexing that happens there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, conventions develop for reasons. Some of these reasons may be cultural or aesthetic, but many of them are functional: people adopt things that work. I am certainly not identifying cultural convention with biological mechanisms, as you imply; I am saying that a mechanism for visually distinguishing words based upon relative proximity and distance seems to have been a really good idea. It is not a 'cultural' convention; at the least, it is begging the question to call it such. It is not something that was rooted in our culture or expressive of some extragraphic cultural value. It was an innovation at a particular place and time that very quickly became widely adopted and became the standard convention, I believe, because of its usefulness. You seem to be implying that conventions are functionally interchangeable, i.e. that a different word-distinguishing mechanism would be just as good from a readability perspective. But I indicated a specific reason why changing weight for different words would be problematic for readability, since we have strong evidence that different types have different spatial frequencies and readers need to adjust for these.

[By the way, the fact that human beings <em>can</em> adjust for different spatial frequencies, and hence can read across a wide range of weights, widths and stroke modulations, is something that can be added to the portmanteau of [[readerability]].]</div>

No, I'm saying how can you know it can't?
And empirically?
I'm pointing out the flaws in making deductions about how reading works based on RSVP testing of 17-25 year-old English speakers in the 21st century.
As for even color, surely text without spaces has more even color?

<em>...if as culturally evolved convention it didn’t have some adaptive excellance in functional-anatomical terms that would allow it to persist.</em>

Yes, it seems likely that's true. But to then deduce that the part of the brain which lights up when it sees words is responding to "discrete object files" is a non sequitur. There are many ways that the brain can isolate words from letter streams, as I showed a few posts ago.

Word-as-discrete-object is a calculated intellectual construct dependent on memory, not seen.
Letters and ligatures are no doubt seen as discrete objects, but it's not logical to argue that a collection of non-contiguous, non-overlapping things are seen as a singular item.

"Know" is a very strong word that. I'd say I hypothesize for good reasons. I can easily make a page extremely hard to read by violating rules that are followed by every script. Eg., they are all written in straight lines, and generally with uniform spaces between lines, also uniformity as far as spacing of units within a line. The fact of similarities from Chinese to Hebrew to Latin script writing lends plausibility to a common biological influence. </div>

I have seen a ton of scripts that are new to me here at Reading and the one thing that struck me is how uneven the color of most scripts seems to be. Not least calligraphic Arabic. Japanese too looks a great deal like raisin bread. This is why I don't buy the idea that page wide evenness is a universal value. But on the individual glyph level ( assuming your script uses that structure - it may not) I think a certain common urge to harmony can be seen. And on the page too there can be more than one kind of harmony like there is more than one system of notes in music. 

So put a bit more simply, I think it's richer and more complicated situation than the notion of even color can support. 

Also, my respect for the portmanteau grows.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick: <em>Letters and ligatures are no doubt seen as discrete objects, but it’s not logical to argue that a collection of non-contiguous, non-overlapping things are seen as a singular item.</em>

Let's back up a bit here. The conventional word space <em>is</em> a visualisation of the word, a mechanism that indeed allows us to <em>see</em> ‘a collection of non-contiguous, non-overlapping things’ as a unit based upon proximity of those things within the unit and relative distance from other collections. This isn't in any sense ‘not logical’. A ‘collection’ is a singular noun: your own term implies unitisation of multiple things grouped together.

We have strong evidence that the length of words perceived in the parafovaea influences saccade distance, so that is one obvious way in which the visualisation of words, as separated by spaces, contributes to how we read. But that is a discreet reading phenomenon from word recognition, which is demonstrable by the fact the saccade distances remain predictable whether the words ane os arn nct rcaclahlc. What remains at issue is the cognitive process by which either word shape, or sub-word shapes other than individual letters, contribute to word recognition. Denis Pelli's study indicates a quantifiable contribution of word shape to reading speed, which is considerably smaller than the contribution of letters (as I would expect) but still significant.

What I understand Peter and Bill to be questioning is <em>how</em> the contribution of the letters takes place, positing that familiar patterns of proximal shapes may be recognised as units between letter and word. This isn't unreasonable, and certainly not illogical, since we know that individual letters are recognisable if key features remain identifiable even if the rest of the letter is degraded, <em>and these features are not necessarily contiguous.</em> I other words, we already know that ‘non-contiguous non-overlapping things’ can be recognised as ‘singular items’ -- in this case letters --, so it isn't unreasonable to posit that e.g. a pair of letters might be recognised in a similar way.

[None of this should be taken to imply that I accept the models that Peter and Bill put forward as true. Only that I don't think they are illogical.]</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eben, I think calligraphy in is not such a good comparison, unless it is a formal hand. The formal scribal hands, intended for extended reading, are more regular than other hand writing. I don't know about Arabic, but I would bet that anything for extended text would be much more regular than when the purposes are more decorative. And type is generally more even than hand writing, because of the greater ability to adjust the weights of strokes and joins. 

Japanese is a special case because they regularly mix more than one script. I think I remember someone writing here on Typophile that the different scripts are deliberately differentiated, so that the reader can immediately recognize which script is being used, and interpret it accordingly. So it is an interesting case, and I don't know enough to say anything about it. Perhaps if there are any Japanese graphic designers they could tell us about issues of color and mixing scripts.

The standard formal literary hand for most Arabic text, and the model for Arabic text typography no matter how debased, is the <em>naskh</em> style. Like all the classical styles, naskh is rule-based and the proportions of letters are strictly defined relative to the pen width (which makes the idea of a bold or light naskh meaningless: if you change the weight to size proportions of the letters you no longer have naskh). But the nature of the rules are such as to allow considerable variation in performance through the use of discretionary alternate forms, elongations, etc., as the rules permit. Complexity gives the illusion of freedom, but once one starts analysing what is happening at the level of letters and their connections, the rules become apparent.

As announced at TypeCon, Brill Academic will be publishing Tom Milo's <em>Grammar of the Arabic Naskh Script,</em> which describes the rules of the naskh style in terms of competence and performance.</div>

[reacting to your “put forward as true”]

Ludwig Wittgenstein / <em>Vermischte Bemerkungen</em>: “Das eigentliche Verdienst eines Kopernikus oder Darwin war nicht die Entdeckung einer wahren Theorie, sondern eines fruchtbaren neuen Aspekts.” [ What a Copernicus or a Darwin really achieved was not the discovery of a true theory, but of a fertile point of view. ]

John: “[…] positing that familiar patterns of proximal shapes may be recognised as units between letter and word[…]”

[not sure if I can identify with that]

What I'm positing is that, when it comes to familiar words, recognition for skilled readers occurs directly from role-units and role-unit evoked forms, “<em>without mediation through [internal] letter representations</em>.” [ Paller & Gross / 1998 ] Letters contribute by supplying the role units (bowls and stems) and the role-unit evoked forms (counters). I think what Bill and I are proposing is that recognition doesn't happen through a complex combinatorial arithmatic that proceeds in heirarchical steps from simple features to entire words. Recognition happens simply and directly on the basis of a read-out of identity, local combination and location at the role-unit level. Something like the combinatorial arithmatic may happen at various levels when we are learning to read, encounter unfamiliar words or words in unfamiliar scripts, but not in what I'm calling the 'rapid automatic visual word-form resolution' that characterizes the immersive reading of motivated fluent readers.

Maybe this doesn't feel like a fertile point of view to those who don't already share it, or can't readily assimilate the terms.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Copernicus and Darwin were so fertile because they had theories that did capture fundamental truths, even if there weren't totally correct. Wittgenstein doesn't get it right, as usual. 

I'm not ready to declare Peter to be Copernicus, but if he's right, and I suspect he is, it is because he is on to something fundamental about reading. 

What that something is, as Peter noted to me recently using a phrase in yet another paper, is that visual processing of words does not stop with identification of letters. In the slot processing view, once letters are identified visually, everything else is cognitive. There is a shift to abstract units, the letters, and these are used in some kind of combinatorial look-up process. But the fact that computers are good at spell-check in this way doesn't mean that our brains are. 

In fact almost all of us are pretty pathetic when it comes to arithmetic, compared to a computer. And I have no problem reading all kinds of words that I would probably misspell, as I am a poor speller. All of which says to me it is likely that something different is going on in the brain, more like the matrix resonance model I explained above. In this, visual processing is not restricted to identifying letters, but a whole visual word pattern of sub-letter units is represented in a matrix. And then that matrix paints our whole visual word memory bank, and when something resonates, bingo, the meaning attached is sent on to further cognition. 

To me the fact that we are bad at arithmetic compared to a computer, and great at pattern recognition compared to a computer, means that something significantly different is going on in my head from the way the computer I'm typing on now is programmed.  </div>

It's the pre-emption of visual processing idea that's got me up in arms.

The word-as-primarily-an-orthographic-object idea is in stark contrast to the Noordzij notion of the word as primarily a visual rhythmic object constituted by the whites of the word and the black of the letters.

I think it's important to add that the information about letter parts or aspects also includes their relative location within the whole word.

Bill, I think that's right. The information that needs to be compiled includes information about relative location within the whole word or bounded map. Also included is 'local combination' detection. This involves where, on the whole word template or map, joins and vertices sit.

		<div class="commentbody">I wonder what Mr William of Occam would have to say about all this?

It seems to me that we have a number of reasonable hypotheses about what might happen during reading, any or a mix of which might well be true, but I'm not sure if any of them are <em>necessary.</em></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Occam's principle only applies if you can't distinguish between alternative hypotheses by experiment. And even then its importance is debatable. 

Here I am suggesting experiments whose results will, I think, seriously question the slot processing view, and follow from the matrix resonance model. Hence Occam is irrelevant.

As to what is necessary, no hypothesis is necessary. As Bertrand Russell said about the "economy of thought" view of science (Ernst Mach): "The greatest economy of thought is not to think."

But if you want to learn, then developing alternative hypotheses and testing them against one another has proven extremely helpful in advancing our understanding of the world and ourselves.

		<div class="commentbody">I was responding to Peter's use of the word 'need': <em>The information that needs to be compiled includes information about relative location within the whole word or bounded map.</em> To be fair, though, his comment should be read as presuming the validity of your hypothesis and not, as it first struck me, as begging the question.

This is a very long thread, and I did not read all of the middle section. Can you direct me to the post that outlines your proposed experiment(s)?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, in a long post on Nov 15 I lay out the matrix resonance model; it is a model mechanism for the kind of visual processing that Peter has been arguing for. On Nov 16 and 17 I describe the experiments. On Nov 24 I reply to Denis Pelli. On Nov 26 is my rebuttal to his reply. On Nov 30 I propose some additional experiments. 

All of these are alas very long posts, but if you print them out the will be easier to read. Of course that's an indication that there's more to reading than slot processing of letters :) 

Hmmm. That was a joke, but it just occurred to me that it would be interesting to test printed material of the same coarse dpi as the screen, and see if, eg ability to proof read and the reported reading comfort deteriorate the same as they do on screen. This would get at whether the back-lighting is a problem with screen text, or it's mainly the resolution issue. Not a test of orthographic processing vs gestalt processing, but could be revealing.  </div>

My guess is that resolution is the primary problem and not the backlight. To finish the test design you would want printed copy at high and low resolution and backlit text at high and low resolution. To get high resolution backlit text, you can print to transparency material. When you put transparencies onto a white screen, the text looks amazing. So very crisp. Interestingly, you get color fringing effects created by the RGB subpixel structure on the screen.

I would love to see this study done as it is an interesting question, but don’t have the time to do it myself right now. If there is a student interested in taking this up as a project, I would be happy to collaborate with them. I think we have code around here for printing text at lower resolution than the printer’s native resolution. Relatedly, there was an article in the October issue of Human Factors on optimal text versus background color combinations. I haven’t read it yet.
