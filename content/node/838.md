    way from there yet. I also don&#39;t find it any more stable than 9.x, despite

    happy with that - but then there are no user interface issues with a server. <BR>
    <BR>We&#39;re currently running one web server on 8.6, one on 9.2 and one on X

    &#40;Apple&#41; World Wide Developers Conference that 1 million people were using
    X at the beginning of the year, and he hopes for 5 million by the end of the year.
    Frankly, 1 million is pitiful, and marks what people really think of X despite
    all the hype - it&#39;s around 3% of the installed base. To get to 5 million all
    Apple has to do is claim that most of the Macs they ship this year are &#34;actively&#34;

  body: ' I didn&#39;t much like OSX at first, but I am trying to integrate it into
    my life little by little. Initially, everything I did was in Classic mode, which
    is utterly pointless. I think the whole concept of Classic was a big mistake on
    Apple&#39;s part. Like swimming in a mountain lake, the only way to do it is to
    dive in. All or nothing. Otherwise it&#39;s tippy-toe torture, and that&#39;s
    exactly what Classic is. <BR> <BR>Early on, pretty much all I did was fiddle with
    the OS for a few moments once or twice a week, but now I have Photoshop, Illustrator,
    BBEdit and Toast running native. Once FontLab, QXP and Dreamweaver are X&#39;d,
    I&#39;ll use it more often. <BR> <BR>Besides not having my favorite apps native,
    the thing that drives me the most nuts about X is saving and opening files from
    dialog boxes. Sometimes I have no idea how I navigated to a particular volume
    and folder... Sometimes it seems like the OS won&#39;t let me save/open stuff
    where I want it, and if I do manage, I fear I&#39;ll never find it again! In other
    words, some of the most basic tasks are rendered needlessly complex in X. <BR>
    <BR>For the time being, the OS versions mirror the breakdown -- OS9=90% of my

  body: ' Again, John, I need to keep 9.0.4 on there to run the audio editing stuff.
    It doesn&#39;t even run under 9.1, otherwise I could use Classic. And audio editing
    is very, very dependent upon timing issues, and the main audio software packages
    &#40;Cubase, Logic, Cakewalk&#41; are only just starting to ship OS X versions.
    It&#39;s apparently very hard to write software to control timing inside OS X.
    Reason is shipping, which is cool, but I require Cubase for the VST support. &#40;ReWire
    is the answer to a question nobody asked.&#41; <BR> <BR>But there will be a G4
    or G5 in my future, probably early next year, depending on how business goes,
