  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">The rule is that for body text and legibility use a serif font. Is this a hard and fast rule? I have seen many annual reports, books, etc that use a sans serif for their body text and they are all very clean and legible. I am doing an annual report and have been told to adhere to the &#34;rule.&#34; But I am wondering if that rule is valid and should be a designers default for selecting and setting type. <BR> <BR>If you cannot answer this question can you please provide me resources on the web that could help.  <BR> <BR>Thank you.</div>

Right or wrong, how is it decided to use something such as Rotis Semi Serif to set an entire book? <BR> <BR>Would&#39;ve loved to be a fly on the wall at that meeting. Incidentally, after my initial enthusiasm, I found it wearing to put down No Logo then pick it back up and adjust all over again. Interesting experiment, however.
