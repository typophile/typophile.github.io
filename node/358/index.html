I think in this case it might be too much. <BR> <BR>Ottawa upside down?  I like how it creates a &#39;heal tread&#39; upside down, compliments the front &#39;tread&#39;.  But I can&#39;t read it that easily.  So it might be better to play it safe. <BR> <BR>On the volunteerism issue, I think &#34;for&#34; and &#34;ottawa&#34; could form a bit more of a defined cirlce around volunteer.  pull it around a bit more. <BR> <BR>Otherwise.

		<div class="commentbody">thanks guys - couldn&#39;t have done it without yas. well if I had a second pair of eyes in my pocket I guess I could. mucho gracias mi amigos! I was really unsure about it in the beginning, thought I&#39;d have to can it.  <BR> <BR>P.S. Canada does have 3 official Languages. Nanavut  &#40;and that would be hell - you just can&#39;t wonkerize those glyphs or they say something else&#41; - thankfully it&#39;s not needed for this project for some reason...but museums and gov funded people gotta. muahahahha <BR> <BR> <BR></div>
