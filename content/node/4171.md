body: One of our art directors is trying to match this type face found on an embossed,
  letter-pressed invitation for a Mizrahi event. Any guesses or suggestions for a
  digital font that has the same &#34;feel&#34;. <BR> <BR>The sample was about 8 point
  type so the scan is rather rough. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/32874.gif"

  body: 'The logo for Isaac Mizrahi was designed by Tibor Kalman, with Douglas Riccardi
    in 1990. It seems it was drawn using Bodoni as a model, with a few alterations,
    note the distinct shapes of the R, Z, C, as well as the M. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s
    an excerpt from &#34;Tibor Kalman: Perverse Optimist&#34; <BR>&#34;...The M&amp;Co
    redesign drew from the whimsical functionalism of Mizrahi&#39;s fashion, taking
    the designer&#39;s name in Bodoni and &#34;screwing with its proportions,&#34;
    as Kalman put it, &#34;intentionally taking something elegant and replacing it
    with human hands.&#34; <BR> <BR>Mizrahi also adds; &#34;It&#39;s just Bodoni with
    a splayed &#34;M&#34; that he [Kalman] invented.&#34;'

  body: Ah such a wonderful and thorough answer.  <BR> <BR>My colleagues were telling
    me &#34;Bodoni&#34; but I kept saying &#34;look at the M!&#34; A forest and trees
    sort of thing. :\ <BR> <BR>Thanks, Alexander!

  body: I don&#39;t know if this might comfort you Kristin, but I wouldn&#39;t ever  <BR>have
    associated your sample with Bodoni. That M is so obvious  <BR>I couldn&#39;t look
    past it.
