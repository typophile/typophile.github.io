body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm an iOS/Android app developer, and inspired in part by Apple's
  recent iBooks font overhaul, I've started looking at how I might improve the typography
  in my own app. I've been reading up a lot on typography the last few weeks, but
  I'm still a total novice at this stuff and I'm hoping people here might be able
  to point me in the direction of some specific fonts (or at least some approaches
  to font selection) that might work well for it.  It's actually a pretty successful
  app and I'm OK with spending some money to license a really great font, but a free
  font recommendation would be lovely too assuming that the license allows for it
  to be bundled with a non-open-source app.\r\n\r\nMy app is a Chinese-English translation
  dictionary, and while originally I was mostly looking at improving the font we use
  for Chinese (replacing the decidedly ugly built-in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_sans-serif_typeface|Hei-style]]
  ones with a nice and readable [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_(typefaces)|Ming-style]]),
  I've realized that I really ought to consider replacing the font used for English
  text too; I'd like something that's distinctive, looks good next to a Ming-style
  Chinese font (so probably something serifed) and that's well-suited for the type
  of reading one does in a dictionary.\r\n\r\nAlso, Chinese text in dictionaries is
  usually accompanied by pronunciation guides, written in a system called Pinyin -
  uses the Roman alphabet along with diacritical marks to indicate which of the four
  tones a particular syllable is in (macron / acute / caron / grave). So I'd like
  to either find a third font that I can use for that (something that goes well with
  the other two, but is distinctive enough to make it easy to distinguish from the
  other non-Chinese font) or just choose an English font that's also diacritic-friendly
  and remains very readable at different weights (so that I could, say, make the Pinyin
  semibold and the English regular).\r\n\r\nSo: does anyone have any recommendations
  for fonts I should consider? I'm in this for the long haul, so I'm primarily focusing
  on Retina / XHDPI displays and am OK if a font looks a bit fuzzy on lower-resolution
  smartphones.\r\n\r\nI'm also looking for more general advice on how to style / space
  text in a dictionary entry; they generally have a lot of different sections that
  you're trying to separate - parts of speech, fields of use (biology, law, etc),
  styles (old-fashioned, obscene, slang), usage notes, example sentences (which in
  a Chinese dictionary combine Chinese characters, Pinyin, and English), etc - but
  using a different font (or even just a different style) for every one of these seems
  liable to give my users seizures. How do I separate a lot of different types of
  information in a single page of fairly-dense text on a smartphone screen?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMichael
  Love"

  body: "Brioso comes to mind, but it's not a (dictionary) text face really. I suggest
    you start researching Chinese typefaces, because the chosen style will most likely
    be the most prominent visual element, and there aren't that many to choose from.
    The Latin alphabet will have to sit well with the Chinese. As for your other questions,
    you should find a skilled book / graphic designer to help you develope a good
    hierarchy and a template that's easy to navigate.\r\n\r\nIf you by any chance
    should happen to think I am one, feel free to drop me a mail :)"

  body: "For reasons of rendering clarity and matching the stroke-centric\r\nnature
    of Chinese, I might recommend a slab serif. At which point\r\nI can't resist shamelessly
    suggesting a very recently released\r\ndesign that I played a role in: http://ernestinefont.com\r\nErnestine's
    large x-height and ample width also play a positive\r\nrole in terms of screen
    rendering. I'd have to double-check\r\nwhether it supports Pinyin, but if it doesn't
    it would certainly\r\nbe possible to commission an extension.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "riccard0 - thanks! Some good ideas in there, and a Retina Display is actually
    surprisingly similar to a densely-packed column of text in a printed dictionary
    in a lot of ways.\r\n\r\nfrode frank - thanks, Brioso is a neat one I wasn't familiar
    with - quite beautiful, not sure if it'll work as a font for small screen text
    but definitely worth trying out. We probably should consider hiring a designer
    for the hierarchy stuff, yes.\r\n\r\nhrant - I'm liking the slab serif idea; on
    my own I found Skolar which seems like another good candidate, though I'm not
    quite sold on it at small sizes. It doesn't look like Ernestine supports Pinyin,
    but I'm not too worried about that (we added Pinyin to Droid Sans Bold ourselves
    for our Android app using OTMaster, though with a licensed font I imagine the
    designer wouldn't want us mucking around with their characters).\r\n\r\nAndreas
    St\xF6tzner - thanks, I'll look him up.\r\n"

  body: "Some random comments:\r\n\r\nTest the minimal size of Chinese characters
    first: I think most Chinese fonts are hard to read and will lose \"less important\"
    strokes at 8 or 9px. So as long as your Latin font reads well at that size it
    won't be a problem.\r\n\r\nFor pinyin characters, don't forget we also have the
    vowel \xFC which can occur in all four tones: \u01D6\u01D8\u01DA\u01DC.\r\n\r\nI
    won't talk about the styles of dictionaries, but if you want some bold Chinese
    typeface, you'd better choose a right font first -- many Chinese fonts don't have
    a bold version.\r\n\r\nFinally, note that we usually do not slant Chinese characters.
    Underlines, setting it in Kaiti (Regular script) or FangSong (Imitation Song)
    are common alternatives ways to emphasize words without emboldening them."
