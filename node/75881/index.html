  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>i would like to take the opportunity and ask for some advice/corrections in regard to the following project:</p>
<p>a while ago i had downloaded the free font &ldquo;say it fat&rdquo; by timo titzmann &ndash; <a href="http://www.id84.de/type/say-it-fat/">http://www.id84.de/type/say-it-fat/</a></p>
<p>while i like the style a lot, the original is very basic (~95 glyphs). i thus decided to overhaul the typeface and have completed the following codepages (the font is lowercase only):</p>
<p>0000 - c0 controls and basic latin
0080 - c1 controls and latin-1 supplement
0100 - latin extended-a</p>
<p>cyrillic is almost completed and greek and vietnamese latin are in the works, too. however, as this is my first font work proper and i am no type designer, there are loads of issues &ndash; but it&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>-&gt; <strong>đ</strong> and <strong>ħ</strong> need to be worked on, but the low ascender is a big problem here &ndash; suggestions on how to handle it are very welcome. it would also influence the design of the cyrillic glyphs <strong>ћ</strong> and <strong>ђ</strong>.</p>
<p>any feedback, tips, and/or help is appreciated (weird looking characters, inconsistency in design/appearance or the like).</p>
<p>the original author has been contacted and has expressed interest in a possible update.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks for the feedback &ndash; this was actually the one thing i planned on keeping, as i had tried out shorter diacritics, but they didn&rsquo;t look good to me.</p>
<p>in addition to that, vietnamese and other extended latin characters stack diacritics which effectively restricts using steep inclines or declines &ndash; here&rsquo;s an example to illustrate what i mean (pinyin tones &ndash; macron, acute and caron on top of dieresis):</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/SayItFat-uni01D8_3887.png" alt=""></p>
<p>another problem would be that i&rsquo;d have to change the dot accent and dieresis as well in order to maintain distinctiveness, as the other accents are based on them and it would disrupt the overall appearance &ndash; but i will consider adding alternatives, thanks again for the suggestion. updates to follow.</p>

Seriously, I think that designing diacritics for a display face such as this one presents even more trade-offs than usual.
Overall, it seems that you are concentrating more on an aesthetic model and less on actual usage and recognisability.
Code-point completeness is a vain goal if the result isn&rsquo;t usable.
Make those accents fat! :-)
By the way, in this style of type, diacritics often reach above the ascenders. There are also several threads on the topic of diacritics, and about vietnamese ones (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=vietnamese+diacritics+site%3Atypophile.com)">http://www.google.com/search?q=vietnamese+diacritics+site%3Atypophile.com)</a>.</div>

<p><strong><cite>I think you will have an hard time with the kreska</cite></strong>
i have a hard time with the entire font so far &hellip; i think the kreska aspect is something way beyond my scope, requiring glyph substitution and ot programming (i&rsquo;m just an interested layman). i will probably have to sacrifice typographic accuracy in this case.</p>
<p><strong><cite>1. Overall, it seems that you are concentrating more on an aesthetic model and less on actual usage and recognisability. 2. Code-point completeness is a vain goal if the result isn&rsquo;t usable.</cite></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>i don&rsquo;t know if the two are really mutually exclusive. 2. i&rsquo;m a completist, there&rsquo;s no way this will change anytime soon.
as a matter of fact, i had made a pdf specimen with sample paragraphs in various languages &ndash; it looked alright to me in croat, german and french (which i speak). but you have a valid point nonetheless.</li>
</ol>
<p>the pdf (italian included, plus a number of other languages, eastern and western european):
<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?iof46nel7jxun1y">http://www.mediafire.com/?iof46nel7jxun1y</a></p>
<p><strong><cite>Make those accents fat! :-)</cite></strong>
alright, alright! consider it on the list. this means i will have to start over again &hellip; wonderful (especially if i take into account how anal i am about never letting go of unifinished things).</p>
<p>what bothers me more than the accents right now is still the way the đ (croat d) and the ħ (h bar) turned out.</p>
<p><strong><cite>The acute and grave could be better distinguished if you cut them in half and made the low end start at or near the center of the letter.</cite></strong>
as written above, i&rsquo;ll make an alternative version with heavy diacritics. the original had three characters with diacritics (strictly speaking there are five, with the i and the j): ä, ö and ü &ndash; i took their design as the starting point for the others.</p>
<p><strong><cite>You&rsquo;ll probably have to start over with the eszett after you&rsquo;ve learned more about it.</cite></strong>
kevin, i&rsquo;m german.
but if you mean typographic conventions, then you&rsquo;re correct. the current shape has been a deliberate decision (which doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s right &ndash; i happened to like the flow of the form coalescing). thanks!</p>

not really &ndash; the fact that i&rsquo;m a native speaker doesn&rsquo;t mean anything in this context &ndash; as i wrote in my initial post, i am no type designer (or any kind of designer &ndash; i&rsquo;m from the legal field &hellip; doh!), so more likely than not, i have blatantly ignored or rather gratuitously broken fundamental rules. it looks nice to me &ndash; but then again, many people don&rsquo;t mind using the acute or even grave accent in lieu of an apostrophe &hellip; hence, no worries &ndash; if in doubt, it&rsquo;s a mistake on my part.</div>

<p>great work! i know timos &ldquo;say it fat&rdquo; from 26plus-zeichen.
awesome you are upgrading it the latin2 and more!</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m german - hence an eszett native speacker:-)</p>
<p>your &ldquo;ſ-s&rdquo;-combination is too wide, beacause it looks still like two gyphs. that&rsquo;n not bad, beacsue it originaly was a ligature once, but up to know it&rsquo;s an single gyph.</p>
<p>i like your variant which makes the &ldquo;ß&rdquo; look more than a &ldquo;ſ-s&rdquo; than a &ldquo;B&rdquo;.</p>
<p>if you are interested, here is a similar idea, which i had for my [[http://26plus-zeichen.de/fonts/graphit/]]:
