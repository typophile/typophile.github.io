  who happens to be a Product manager at a large social network company. The blog
  would be more Daring Fireball style with occasional posts in the long form and many
  links from the interwebs. In both these format the common point would be the highly
  insightful yet opinionated commentary.\r\nI have decided to go with Skolar as the
  primary text for body text. Can you guys suggest a secondary font that you know
  goes well with Skolar. I tried looking around but could not find great examples
  with other font combinations. \r\nThe other combination that might work is the FF
  Meta and FF Meta Serif but I would like to use that as the last resort.\r\n"

  body: "@Stephen Hey Stephen,\r\nThanks for the quick reply. The idea of using Skolar
    was primarily because of the scholarly, insightful feel yet highly having a character
    of its own. Also would love to hear of some other fonts that you think will do
    the job (and available from Typekit) and also if Skolar would have done the job
    in the first place. Funny that you link to that post. Has been an open tab in
    my browser for me to read later from the last 4-5 days.\r\nFF Meta/Serif was always
    the last resort. \r\nPS: Wondering why I was not following you on Twitter. Doing
    it now. :)"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nthis is how Skolar Web will look like in IE6/XP (rastered by grayscaling)
    IE8/Vista (rastered by ClearType). These two and Mac rendering (which turns out
    pretty well for Skolar) should be the three main renderings to look at before
    you any webfont on your website. The marketing texts tend to be deceiving sometimes
    (that does not come as a surprise I suppose).\r\n\r\nI will update you on when
    this is available. It has been postponed several times already. Hopefully, in
    January.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/render-waterfall-ie6-windows-xp_6398.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/render-waterfall-ie8-windows-vista_4246.png]"

    for Christmas (thanks dad!) and am planning on using it for much of my personal
    correspondence and self-branded freelance materials.\r\n\r\nI'm also wondering
    if typekit will be the only system for delivering Skolar as a webfont, or if there
    are plans to make it available through other services."

  body: We are delayed, but it is on its way (month or so I hope). At least some weights.
    It will be available from more service. I am not sure which exactly, you would
    need to ask TypeTogether.
