body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a series of book covers dealing with ecological,
  sociological and anti-globalist topics. Titles are as diverse as Seeds of Deception
  (GMO story) to delicate themes like Escape from Intimacy(sex adiction)to quite positive
  ones like Nudge (something like you can achieve big changes in life with small help
  etc.).\r\nTarget are mostly women but I don't want to use \"feminine\" looking font
  in titles like Death of Nature of course. ;)\r\n\r\nI need sans-serif, humanist
  font and I feel like those with open counters work best.\r\nI see title in bigger
  size(upper case letters)because I want it to serve as attention catcher but not
  dangerous looking like warning (we don't want to scary people off) but to catch
  their attention and invite them to read the books which would possibly open their
  eyes on these many topics (we don't want people to live in fear after they read
  these books but to use them in their advantage in their lives).\r\n\r\nSo I need
  sans serif, open counters, humanist font that would be neutral enough to be able
  to cover such diverse titles, serious but not scary. More like warmish.\r\n\r\nOnly
  one I have right now is Fedra Sans and I will use it unless someone suggests a better
  one. What do you think? Any suggestions?"

    versatile (since it can also be used for longer stretches of text without any
    problem). [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Kievit|FF Kievit]] could also
    be an option.\r\n\r\nPersonally I also really like [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=23|Stella]]
    from FTF, but unfortunately it's (still) only available as T1.\r\n[[http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/ParisinePTF]]

  body: "Hi, vacation's over so back to work. ;)\r\nThank you all for your suggestions.\r\nI
    think Ronnia would be my choice.\r\n\r\nMilo is really a nice typeface but somehow
    since our titles will all be in capitals I don't feel too comfortable when I see
    that playful R in titles like DEATH OF NATURE.\r\n\r\nMagma, Optima, Optima Nova
    are all too 'feminine' looking somehow, wanted something more neutral in that
    regard. Amira- I wasn't sure what to think about that one so in the end I ended
    up with Ronnia.\r\n\r\nIN THE MEANTIME our clients changed book format to smaller
    so that's one more reason to\r\nchoose Ronnia- it's open, yet it has narrower
    set width than these other typefaces.\r\n\r\nANY SUGESTIONS for the open counter,
    sans serif, humanist typeface that has a narrow(er)set width (don't want condensed
    version)????? I'll use semibold or bold of any typeface I choose for titles. "

    Kievit]], it is very similar, but has more conventional caps (and they both work
    perfectly for longer stretches of text).\r\n\r\n[edit] Oops, I see I already suggested
    Kievit in an earlier post. :)"
