  body: "I don't know a lot about licenses, but from the list Paul linked to, CDAC's
    Yogesh and Jana Sanskrit would be your best bets in terms of outlines, design,
    etc. The newer version of Mangal that ships with Vista is also quite a nice option,
    in my opinion, but I don't know if that falls under your FOSS umbrella. Do you
    FOSS-fans use Windows? I don't know anything about FOSS :(\r\n\r\nThese three
    I mentioned are all Unicode-encoded OpenType fonts, and will work nicely in Windows.
    Maybe they'd work on other OSes, too\u2026 I don't work with Linux or any of these
    free operating systems, so I can't vouch for them. But you certainly cannot use
    these fonts properly in Mac OS, since they aren't AAT format.\r\n\r\nCan you tell
    us more about what it is exactly that you're looking for, fontana? Do you just
    want to set documents on your computer and print them out yourself, or are you
    creating something more specific? What sort of look are you going for? Scholarly,
    contemporary, something else?"

  body: "Fontana, what you are asking then is that you are looking for a font whose
    Devanagari glyphs you can take and then map these onto a Latin keyboard in a new
    font, right? So you want to create your own Devanagari font with non-standard
    encoding?\r\n\r\nSome of the fonts that Paul has linked to may allow you to do
    this, but I don't know. You should track down the producers of the fonts (the
    URLs of the fonts' producers are often inside the Font Info section of the font
    files\u2026 at least for the fonts that Paul has linked to, I think) and check
    with them first."
