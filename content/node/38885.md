    mentioned above is the catalogue of the exhibition held at the Mus\xE9e de l'Imprimerie
    in Lyon in 2002. In this excellent publication \u2013 which can be ordered from
    the Mus\xE9e \u2013 you will find a very useful piece written by James Mosley
    plus some very good photos of punches, moulds etc., and the engraved prints of
    the original designs for the Romain du Roi. There are also some useful illustrations
    of specimens from the Imprimerie Royale.  "

    Romain Du Roi was available when I was in France back in 2005 for around 20 Euros.
    Unfortunately I was being stupid, didn\u2019t buy it, and I can never remember
    what name it was published under so I can\u2019t order a copy. But if you know
    anyone in France perhaps they\u2019ll be so kind as to track it down."

  body: James, you must be thinking of Tory's Champ Fleury? It's got letters on grids
    too, but that was 150 years before the Romain du Roi. Great reading though, if
    you can read 16th-c. French printed with medieval abbreviations. If you'd rather
    not, <a href="http://www.allbookstores.com/book/9781891788864/Bruce_Rogers/Champ_Fleury.html">here
    is an English translation</a>.
