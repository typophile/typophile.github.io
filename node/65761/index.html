<p>One that I found was on the box for a computer game - but try as I might, I could not identify it. Finally, I took a picture, and submitted that to MyFonts' electronic match, but although that let me find Adobe Present from the Omniglot logo, it didn&rsquo;t find the match for this one:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/word_4581.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This seems to be a plain but calligraphic font&hellip; but I don&rsquo;t think they used hand lettering. (Although the letters did have a 3-D effect, so I suppose it&rsquo;s possible&hellip;)</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/word4_5634.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s another sample. I would think this should be simple and obvious to find, but it has turned out not to be.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll agree with that, but while my previous searches had turned up Jubilee and Post Antiqua, I&rsquo;ve been wishing I could find a closer match.</p>
<p>Post Roman might be what I&rsquo;m looking for, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been digitized, so I can&rsquo;t find a more extensive sample online to compare.</p>
<p>Jubilee is clearly a typeface, not calligraphic hand lettering.</p>
<p>Basically, the reason I thought that this particular style of type was a good substitute for Papyrus was because it wasn&rsquo;t elaborate like an uncial face, or even like Motto (compare [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/mikadan/|Mikadan]] although that&rsquo;s closer to Verona, also more elaborate) or Freehand (compare [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/duly-noted-nf/|Duly Noted]]).</p>
<p>So, basically, think of something like Lydian, but with just a minimum of pointy serifs added, just barely enough to say &ldquo;calligraphy&rdquo;, while avoiding tagging the font with too specific a time and place - because that&rsquo;s the virtue of Papyrus.</p>

<p>I have searched through Part 4, but not Part 6, so I will do so. And Scrivano and Amanda were also fonts I noticed in my frantic searches. I also referred to some print references I have as well, but I have a few others buried in clutter I need to dig out and look at.</p>
<p>As you&rsquo;ve pointed out, there are letterspacing problems, so it may be that this is a very obscure font; I was hoping that there would still be a much closer match that is a real and well-known font - since the shape of the letters seemed familiar to me - but maybe I was wrong.</p>

Rana, Oak Wood, Malandra, FF Elegie Regular, Holly;</p>
<p>and some others I hadn&rsquo;t mentioned in my other posts about possible alternates to Papyrus, but which might also serve that purpose:
Polaris, Clichee, Gararond, Charon, Demi Tasse, Rhino (Mobil)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Actually, though, when I looked up the candidates there, I still didn&rsquo;t find a real match - for those I could find a larger illustration, it turned out they were different.</p>
<p>But I think you are right, and this doesn&rsquo;t exist as a &ldquo;real&rdquo; font, even if it is some obscure free font somewhere. Also, in the samples I provided, I see I failed to include one with a significant distinguishing feature of the design. The bottom right-pointing serif of the lowercase L is so big that it can be mistaken for an uppercase L. Another reason to think that it&rsquo;s likely just some amateur calligraphy.</p>
<p>But I still saw much of what I was looking for, because even if I can&rsquo;t find an exact match, identifying that font was just a part of my search for alternatives to Papyrus - and I did find several of those in that area.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure this is a font.I scrutinized it for a while. The e&rsquo;s, r&rsquo;s etc. are all identical and the s was the crown. Notice it&rsquo;s backslant&hellip; in all occurrences. The only thing that perplexes me is the w. It is almost alien in weight relationships and overall weight. In my ongoing vigil to keep an eye on my fonts I search the &ldquo;free&rdquo; sites all the time and I have seen a number of these naive &ldquo;roundhand&rdquo; forms.</p>
