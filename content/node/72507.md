  need to know what difficulties I could find in terms of type, composition, if it's
  written from left to right or top to bottom.  If there's a wiki or a site where
  I can read information about it please let me know. Here's the list of the languages
  and what I know so far:\r\n\r\n- greek: left to right, no problems with Myriad\r\n\r\n-
  indonesian: from left to right, can work it out as english, no problem\r\n\r\n-
  corean: top to bottom, no problems in terms of type but wondering how to work the
  text direction\r\n\r\n- hindu: not sure if it's left to right, problems with type\r\n\r\n-
  thai: not sure if it's left to right, problems with type\r\n\r\n- chinese: from
  top to bottom and columns from left to right, I've tried with different types and
  I still keep getting the empty squares of missing character. If I move the text
  from horizontal to vertical in illustrator will it have the proper order?\r\n\r\n-
  malasian: left to right, no problems\r\n\r\n- arabic: from right to left, I have
  the world ready illustrator template and I can work it out with myriad\r\n\r\n-
  japanese: top to bottom, no problems with this type:Adobe \uBA85\uC870 Std M but
  wondering how to work the text direction\r\n\r\n- turkish: left to right, no problems
  with myriad\r\n\r\n- tagalo: left to right, no problems\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n"

    from left to right) Old-style Chinese writes in columns from top to bottom, and
    the columns are arranged from right to left.\r\n\r\nNote that here \"Modern\"
    and \"Old-style\" do not correspond to the division between \"Simplified\" and
    \"Traditional\". Nowadays most of the chinese text, regardless of simplified or
    traditional, are set in the modern direction."

    a korean name. A Japanese font isn't any font which contains a full set of hiragana
    and katakana, it needs to contain a large set of Chinese Characters (Kanji) in
    the proper Japanese style. I'm not familiar with japanese typography, however.\r\n"

    some of your other questions, although vertical writing is traditional for Chinese,
    Korean, and Japanese, horizontal left-to-right writing is now normal in Simplified
    Chinese and Korean, and in a context like international packaging, horizontal
    left-to-right writing is entirely acceptable in Japanese and Traditional Chinese
    also. You do not need to set any of them vertically.\r\n\r\nThe Hindi language
    is written in Devanagari script, which is left-to-right but has complex shaping

    first released with Snow Leopard, I'd guess she is running Adobe CS 4 or 5 on
    OS X 10.6. I don't think OS X comes with a hangul gothic - just Apple Myungjo
    and a few display faces. Adobe includes Adobe Gothic in CS 5, but I think they've
    only bundled the bold weight for some reason - I don't have it yet, so I don't
    know how heavy it is.

  body: "<cite>Are you really sure you want to mix a Latin font with the Chinese,
    Japanese, and Korean text? ... It looks very weird to me to have characters not
    lined up in a perfect grid.</cite>\r\n\r\nI have to strongly disagree here, at
    least for Korean. You don't want the letters to line up in a perfect grid unless
    you are intentionally going for the typewriter/fixed-width look. Korean uses spaces
    between words that are typically less than half the width of the hangul letters,
    so even a Korean text containing no numerals or Latin text will never line up
    in a grid in good typographic practice. The full-width and half-width forms are
    never used in horizontally-set Korean typography. In fact, hangul letters have
    uniform width in most available fonts only because of technical limitations. Some
    newer text faces for Korean have different widths for different hangul letters.\r\n\r\nAnd
    for what it's worth, for the few products I have at home using Chinese-only packaging,
    I don't see a perfect grid either. It may be different for Chinese novels and
    the like where Latin letters and numerals are rare.\r\n\r\nFor this project, it's
    best to use the same Latin font for all the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text,
    as Alexandra is already doing, while of course taking care to harmonize the weights
    and adjusting the vertical alignment if needed."

    for printing mock-ups to be shown to potential clients but either way, if you
