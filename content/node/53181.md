  that require to show an element of speed and this proves to be much more difficult
  then I thought. Yes, of course there are the obvious ones; arrows, wings, stripes
  etc.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately, this always looks either Pizza Express, sporty or
  transport/courier service.\r\n\r\nSo do you know of any clever, extraordinary logos
  that suggest speed without being to literal? Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSeb "

    of the obvious ones is also italicisation. Of the image/text/both...\r\n2. The
    other one is letter width. Starting narrow, ending wide... MM Type1 fonts were
    great for these kind of manipulation (if there was axis for letter width).\r\n3.
    if your logo has a multi line text (at least 3) you can indent each line differently
    to express speed (slipping text)\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

    (like a speedometer).
