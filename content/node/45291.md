body: "I will be in New York this week and want to browse typography books and perhaps
  some on graphic design. I used to enjoy Barnes and Noble at 6th and 22nd where they
  had a better than average collection of books on typography.  It has since closed,
  and according to B&N, none of the stores has picked up the typography specialty.
  \r\n\r\nSearched the Typophile site but to now avail. Any suggestions for favorite
  places to browse new books on these topics would be appreciated."
