body: "Hello, this is a school assignment, we\xB4re supposed to \"redesign\" a corporate
  identity keeping some of the elements from the original idea. My first problem is
  that my teacher really doesn\xB4t like AvantGarde, he didn\xB4t want me to use it
  (because it\xB4s \"old and overused\") but since I insisted in keeping it he said
  I should alter it somehow, that\xB4s what I did on the third logo. The first one
  is the original design.\r\n\r\nWhat are your ideas about altering typefaces? I have
  this idea that the original design of a typeface probably took a lot of effort from
  its original designer and altering it is somehow bad, specially in this case, altering
  it just to \"look different from avantgarde\". I built \"a\" and \"g\" from \"o\"
  and \"t\" and altered \"e\" and \"c\". I\xB4m worried that \"a\" has a chance of
  being read like an \"o\", specially in small sizes and I think the \"g\" looks too
  much like number \"9\", maybe that\xB4s one of the reasons Lubalin didn\xB4t design
  it this way...\r\n\r\nWhat are your opinions about this? Should I keep the original
  design of AvantGarde or the altered version? Would you suggest any other highly
  geometric typeface? I did some testing with Futura but I really don\xB4t like its
  \"c\", looks somewaht incomplete to me.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are supposed to express
  the idea of their tagline \"high technology applied to agriculture\", the first
  two leaves are more organic, the last two completely geometric, the middle one is
  a mix of both... Any other suggestions? Kerning? Colors? Any ideas would be really
  appreciated. Thanks. :)"

  body: "If your teacher's dislike of Avant Garde is purely due to its age and popularity
    I would say that is a pretty bad reason to start altering it. The trick is to
    make well known types fresh again through good design.\r\n\r\nI think that the
    success of your treatment should be based on contrasting the geometric, technical
    quality of the letterforms with a more organic leaf shape. The first leaf looks
    a bit too 'drawn', and the diamond shaped leaves seem a bit unorganic. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    a leaf should grow from the stem of the 't' to form the cross bar?\r\n\r\nIf you
    do decide to change the letterforms then you need to look at where the stems and
    bowls of the 'a' and 'g' meet. If you look closely there is a lot more white space
    in the original because the stroke that forms the bowl is not actually a consistent
    width. This may help avoid the 'a' looks like 'o' problem that you mentioned."

  body: "Yeah! I agree with Chris G! Tell your teacher to shove it! Ask for a proper
    reason why you shouldn't use it. I remember a teacher telling me not to use Clarendon
    because it looks too old-fashoned, and it's now one of my favourite typefaces
    and used on my logo! Rebellion!\r\n\r\nI prefer the tighter letter spacing on
    the 2nd two ideas and think there's more in them than the first. \r\n\r\nThe positioning
    of the seedling in the first breaks up the word in the wrong place, whereas in
    the other 2 it breaks the 'agro' from the 'tec' which I imagine is the idea."

  body: I like the angular leaves of the second two. There are a lot of leafy logos
    out there, but the color of your geometric shapes emparts the idea that they're
    techno-leafs well enough to be different, I'd say.

  body: well, i wouldn't tell you teacher to "shove it", but i would question him/her.
    "just because they don't like it" isn't reason enough for a teacher to tell you
    not to use a typeface. if he/she can't articulate a reason beyond taste i might
    be so-inclined to agree with the afore-mentioned insult. =^P
