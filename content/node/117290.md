body: "Hi friends, I am using Whitney font for headlines and I am thinking of using
  Sentinel for body text.  Wondering if anybody has any comments about this choice
  since its a slab serif like Clarendon and so I am not sure if those fonts are meant
  more to be used for headlines reather than body text. So if you have any insights
  about this they would be greatly appreciated. Cheers\r\n\r\nAnd here is a link to
  the Sentinel font:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/sentinel/styles/screensmart/"

  body: "While Clarendon is generally thought of as a display face, and it is also
    bolder than normal for a text face, it isn't completely unsuitable for such use.\r\n\r\nCentury
    Schoolbook, a very legible text face, is sometimes referred to as being related
    to a Clarendon. Also, the Diplomat typestyle for the IBM Selectric typewriter
    (not generally available in North America, but used in the U.K., for example)
    is Clarendon-based, and an appealing style for general typing.\r\n\r\nSentinel
    seems to be entirely suitable for text use, given that it comes in a range of
    weights."

  body: "Just my personal feeling, but Clarendon is a bit off... It's too black and
    \"extended\".\r\nSentinel is just fine! If I remember it right, the Obama campaign
    has used it."

  body: "Not only have people used typefaces similar to Clarendon for body text, but
    even typefaces of the kind to which Stymie, Cairo, and Memphis belong, with unbracketed
    serifs and uniform stroke weight have been used for body copy, with reasonable
    success.\r\n\r\nBut that still is something not recommended; one can use Futura
    or Helvetica for body copy, and people can read it, but that doesn't mean those
    faces are optimal for that purpose. Compared to Futura, however, the Egyptians
    have both humanistic shapes and serifs of a sort, and the complete lack of stroke
    contrast is not nearly the problem that the extreme stroke contrast of Bodoni
    would be.\r\n\r\nWhat I've seen in Stymie and similar faces are local newsletters
    and the like, not major publications or long novels. But they didn't seem to have
    serious issues."
