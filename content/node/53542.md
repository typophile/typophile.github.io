  body: "paragraph \r\n\r\nI don't want to sound like dick but there are tons of fonts
    out there to choose from big names like Adobe, people like me shoot for.  It might
    be the font then again it could be the price, who knows.  It's a tuff market with
    no guarantees buddy.  In the real world we might only use two fonts or three and
    the rest of them are collecting digital dust somewhere in the back-burner. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGuerrizmo+Design"

  body: "Definitely a better sample image. It shows the typeface\u2019s versatility,
    not just for nouveau stuff which is not much in fashion right now."

  body: "The new icon is much better, mostly because the colors in the old one are
    very dull. But tweak that green to have a more intense feeling that works better
    with the colors of the new MyFonts. \r\n\r\nMore importantly, you MUST do a new
    specimen, because this one is terrible. What you\u2019re showing is a period-inspired
    design that fits in contemporary settings, but the specimen does not get that
    across at all. This specimen feels like it took about five minutes, zero thought,
    and in no way complements all the work you put into the typeface. Include an essay
    about your inspiration and working process to help people understand what\u2019s
    going on. You\u2019ve got a versatile face, so use it! Show Galette on a cover,
    as headlines and as copy in magazines, on packaging and in logos! If you don\u2019t
    have the time hire a handful of cool young designers from Coroflot and get them
    do some good stuff. But don\u2019t expect people to grasp the depth of your work
    from three pages of black-and-white text dumped unceremoniously onto the page."

  body: Honestly I would have to see it on MyFonts to see how an intense color looks
    best. It seems like a cooler color will probably pop best against the red/orange
    hues that dominate the myFonts icons, but then again a yellowish green could do
    well, too. Try loading a screenshot of MyFonts into Photoshop and doing ten different
    versions each in a few different positions to see what works well consistently.
