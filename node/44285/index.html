<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi everyone, this is my first post here, I'm not a professional graphic designer, but I made this logo for myself. I read a couple of other posts and I really liked how you guys critique and make suggestions so I wanted to know how bad my logo is, or who knows maybe it's not that bad. I have already made business cards with this logo, however it's on a black background. I wish I had known about this forum before I committed to this logo, but who knows, if you guys help me make it a real logo, I'll make a new batch of business cards. Thanks you for taking the time to view my post.

<div class=commentbody>Hello,
There is two stokes of colour just above and below the text Avila, if you remove them it will complete the A you are looking to create.
Also the position of the text needs to be corrected a little, possibly move it upwards a few pixels.

<div class=commentbody>I'd align the title so the x-height is central to the bar rather than the cap height, because the descenders scraping the bottom of the bar makes it look unset.
Basically i kinda like it!
Oh and I'd maybe try shifting the title left a tiny bit so the "A" of Avila doesn't have a failed relationship with the curve of the graphic "A" (the top being on the curve line, but the angle of the A goes off by the bottom of the A), possibly an OCDesque non-problem that though.
I'm new here, so maybe listen to others more than me, my terminology could be way off as well, but i felt like taking the plunge.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The A and V shapes are quite nice, but the text knocked out of the extended crossbar is problematic. It looks like an afterthought. The font does not, in any way, compliment the logo, and it's not kerned properly or placed thoughtfully. The thin outlines and colors don't really add anything aesthetically, so I'd just stick to black and white without any outlines.
I suggest you take the text out of the black bar, and put the word Avila above the line, and "Video and Editing" below. Also, please, don't use a plus sign, use an ampersand or write out the word. I'd start by looking at fonts like <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/panorama-sg/light/>Panorama</a> or <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-avant-garde-gothic/book/>Avant Garde Gothic</a> or even something Bauhaus-y and fun like <a href=http://sudtipos.com/fonts/44>Reflex.</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello, thanks for the comments and tips. Phil and Troop, I agree with the text having to be centered, and I did understand the "A" having a failed relationship with the other A. However I did consider what Eileen said about the text on the crossbar being problematic, especially after I removed it. Then I went even further as to remove the crossbar completely, and this is what I came up with.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logos_6108.jpg]</div>

<div class=commentbody>You still have a major scale problem, IMO. Is there some reason you feel like the logo must tower over the logotype? Your logo looks like a big bully next to the little type. Spend some time looking around at the size relationship between logo and logotype. Barnes and Noble has some great logo books.
I'm guessing you're actually designing a business card here, not a company identity, but this scale can't work for every application like an identity really needs to.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like 1,2, & 5 quite a bit - I don't agree with Eileen completely about the scale, however I do think for legibility you'll want to bump up the logotype a bit.
Is the "+ Editing" really necessary as part of your name? Seems like "Avila Videography" or even "Avila Video" would be a much stronger name.
Anyhoo, good luck! You're on the right track. :)

<div class=commentbody>The latter solution is best. Simple and versatile. You want to separate your AV 'mark' and your actual company name given that you're going to have scaling issues if you keep them as is.
It reminds me of another logo using similar forms flipped to create different letters. ;o)

<div class=commentbody>I think the latter is best for a general logo, but the designs I like (1,2,5) are best for a business card layout - I think you can make good use of both the line-y and lineless versions.

<div class=commentbody>My choice is for 2/5 (use both depending on the situation). You might want to use a stronger pink on the white background.
Watch your kerning: "Av" in "Avila" is loose. I agree about dropping the "& Editing" part. You might want to come up with an alternate version where the text is bigger to use at small sizes.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks to all for your comments and suggestions once again. I am trying to create an identity, not just business cards, but it probably looks like that because of the size of the last update. I didn't have much trouble deciding whether to take out the "Editing" or not, but it looked weird having the two words in separate rows. I just think it looked like a list, so I put both words in one single row. I put a stronger orange on "Videography" and fixed the kerning. The white background version is for paperwork i.e. letterheads, contracts. The black background version is for business cards, promotional items, and website. I'm very happy with this last update, it looks much cleaner and solid than the first. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/for typo_4252.jpg]</div>
