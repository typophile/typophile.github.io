body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nand here's my second scetch from the last weeks...
  a quite old fashioned script called Gulasch (for the time of being).\r\n\r\nIt's
  my first script font, so I may do some \"stupid\" things yet which could be done
  more efficient if I only knew ...\r\nThe general idea is that every lower case characters
  \"ends\" at one of three possible levels: low, mid and top; this always stays the
  same, so every \"z\" ends mid, every \"b\" ends top. According to this, the following
  character has to \"adjust\" its starting height, so there are three variants to
  \"begin\" a character (connects from a low, mid or top predecessor). There is also
  a variant for beginning of word, having no connector. And ... there are four further
  variants, for the ending of words ... which make a whopping 8 glyph variants for
  each character. At the moment, most of these are composed by  components in fontlab,
  so this works quite well, but anyway it's quite a lot of burocracy (and later, i'd
  like to decompose and fine tune each variant).\r\n\r\nWhat do i want to know?\r\nGeneral
  thoughts and ideas concerning the big picture, future expansion, future reduction
  (glyph count...), and if possible lots of tips how to do a script like this more
  efficiently.\r\n\r\nthanks for your feedback\r\nSebastian"

  body: I don't know much about the technical stuff, but I really like the look of
    this! I especially like the ss in "Quadraturerlass" for some reason.  The "rprogn"
    in  "Elementarprognose" create kind of an unusual rhythm, all of them hanging
    from a straight line on top, but it doesn't seem too disconnected from the rest
    of the text.

  body: Making the connections meet halfway can result in some abruptly visible joins.
    As your design stands, I think you could eliminate many of the variant forms by
    having all low and middle connections extend entirely from the leading letter
    to disappear into the beginning(/low/middle) form of the following letter. The
    top connections should extend entirely from the top form of the following letter.
    A full set would still be needed for a few exceptional cases such as s.

  body: "Great design.\r\n\r\nTo make it look more naturally handwritten, maybe the
    lowercase g and uppercase G should connect from the tail, not from the top. Also
    the lead into the lowercase e is often higher than where a handwritten e would
    start. In fact, could you just get rid of the top-ending glyphs? That would make
    it easier to lead naturally into the e's, n's, m's etc. and would make your life
    easier with the design!\r\n\r\ntt ligature would also be a good addition I think.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Also, what do you plan to do with single capitals or text in all-caps? At
    the moment it looks like the caps are designed to join onto a lowercase letter
    but this might be a problem with acronyms.

  body: "Wow, you are creating an unique font.\r\nthe rythm it has is not very usual
    in fonts out there.\r\nHowever, I believe that it is not easy to think its design
    the way you are thinking.\r\nThe connection meetings, being each character \"active\",
    could make the joins look weird sometimes.\r\nI'd think of 2 solutions.\r\n1.
    The hardest, maybe, is to design conflictive pairs in one glyph. (Then use the
    open type function of ligatures)\r\n2. Changing the method: think of longer terminals,
    so you make the connections more credible and good looking. You will need at least
    3 glyphs of each character. The a with the long (low) terminal, the a with the
    long (middle) terminal and the a for the long (high) terminal. With this I mean,
    It is easier to think of a script font when the connection of the two glyphs has
    an active and a passive protagonist.\r\nThe first glyph, the active; the second
    one the passive, who is \"touched\" by its neighbour terminal.\r\n\r\nHope this
    helps,\r\nBest\r\nMaximiliano R. Sproviero\r\nLi\xE1n Types.-\r\n"

  body: Sorry to bump this old(er) thread, but I really like this design! The only
    thing that I found 'uncomfortable' is the tail/connection of the z.
