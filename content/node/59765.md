body: "I'm not a typography guy, but I have had the task of administrating a font
  server delegated to me.  Think hot potato.  This is a server where everyone has
  thrown all kinds of fonts onto the server in the past without any concern to the
  licensing, how the font was acquired or how the fonts are use once they are available
  on the server.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing I will need to sort through all the existing
  fonts, one by one, and match them to licensing I find online.\r\n\r\nAny recommendation
  for font server software that has great licensing management features?  i'd like
  to key-in main licensing features if there is a way to broadcast this info from
  the server to the end-user.\r\n\r\nAny additional techniques or applications that
  would help to control use of fonts?  Prevent collect for output, when it isn't allowed.
  \ Prevent logo creation, when it is not allow.  Prevent internet use, when it is
  not allowed.  But still allow these things when the licensing does allow for it.
  \ I can't micromanage 500 users, but I'd like to have a way to indicate licensing
  restrictions, at the time of end-user server use.  If there was a way to require
  users to read or agree to the licensing at the point of use, even better.  Right
  now, the people that buy the font are agreeing to licensing for fonts they do not
  use.  Buyers agree to anything, and that is never communicated effectively to those
  that do use the fonts.  Users think we \"own\" all the fonts.\r\n\r\nWho governs
  or polices font EULAs?  Do they have any guidelines?  What are the visiting hours
  in prison?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDave"

    UTS does keep track of Font Licensing to some extent and I think the newest version
    takes it even a little farther. I'm wrestling with a similar situation as you.
    Font Reserve for some reason would upload everything and anything from people's
    hard drives onto the server. When Extensis came and did a font migration for us
    it looked like a jungle of fonts with restricted or no licensing. I've been checking
    previous digital and paper trails to find out what we are licensed for and organizing
    that for the new server. UTS will allow you to define smaller groups for restricted
    licensing, but it will not police you. Certainly worth looking into.\r\n\r\nAs
    for EULAs, nobody will look over your shoulders, but if it becomes clear that
    you are blatantly violating a EULA, its possible a foundry might challenge you
    or in some cases audit you. I know Adobe will occasionally do audits of software
    licensing for large companies. I don't know if they do it as much for fonts though.\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: "Since y'all are discussing it, I'll volunteer some extra details, though
    normally I try to avoid shilling for my product here on Typophile.\r\n\r\nActually,
    to a large extent UTS *will* police you, if the Universal Type Server administrator
    sets it up that way. You can set it up so all the fonts known to UTS are only
    stored on the server. With the new UTS 2, you can even set a system font policy
    that defines which fonts users are allowed to have manually installed in the system
    fonts folder, and UTS will remove non-permitted fonts. Of course, that feature
    is off by default as it's quite intrusive, but people who want to really lock
    down their UTS 2 setup can do so.\r\n\r\nUTS also allows you to control whether
    users can add and remove fonts from the server, whether they can collect fonts
    for output, create/delete sets, create/delete licenses, apply license info to
    fonts, and a whole bunch of other stuff. This info can be applied globally to
    a user, or only apply to their rights within a certain workgroup. It can also
    be put into a \"role\" definition and roles can be applied to users as a shortcut
    to give them a particular set of permissions... and you can batch apply settings
    to users as well.\r\n\r\nBy default all font management happens on the server
    in a single central repository of fonts, but individuals can be given personal
    repositories (\"workgroups\") which can be either server-based or client-side.\r\n\r\nUTS
    2 also adds tracking of licenses and associating licenses with fonts, and tracking
    whether your font usage is within your licensing limits. It doesn't *actively*
    prevent usage in excess of the limits, but you can track things and see when adding
    a user to a given workgroup will exceed your license limits.\r\n\r\nWhether individual
    end users have access to this licensing information is dependent on them having
    a certain kind of admin privileges.\r\n\r\nAs for another of your requests, if
    a font management app allows a font to be used in, say, Illustrator, AFAIK there's
    no way for it to then disallow somebody turning the font into outlines for a logo
    or whatever. I don't know of any font management app that currently allows/disallows
    access to fonts at the level of specific applications, though I imagine it could
    be done. (I'm not sure there's general demand for that feature, however.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\nThomas

    finished sorting fonts, but am still dealing with proper license issues. I had
    the basics training on UTS version one a while back. I should try and find out
    more about the newer version.\r\n\r\nHope your new home and job are going well.\r\n\r\nStephen"
