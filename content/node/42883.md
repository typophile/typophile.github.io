    to a minimum. Everyone's Type ID needs are attended to in a timely manner with
    the same level of \"urgency\". You did well posting in the Type ID forum and including
    a well sized image. Your topic title should reflect this.\r\n\r\nWe're a humble
    and mostly quite community, so try and keep it to a dull roar in the future.\r\n\r\nEnjoy
    your stay, hopefully you'll continue to contribute."

  body: "Steve, Andrew definitely has a point: there\u2019s even a <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_2\">FAQ
    on this</a>:\r\n<cite>What do I enter in the \u201CTitle\u201D line?\r\nTry to
    define your type ID request as clearly as possible. For example \u201C1960\u2019s
    newspaper headline face\u201D or \u201CLost in Translation movie logo\u201D or
    \u201Cretro script\u201D will do nicely. Whereas \u201CPlease help me identify
    this font\u201D is pretty pointless as that\u2019s the only thing we do on the
    Type Identification Board. Compare it to a newspaper where every single headline
    would say \u201CStuff happened!\u201D</cite>\r\n\r\nAccurate descriptions do help,
    both in identifying and finding things later. Exclamation marks don\u2019t.\r\n\r\n<cite>And
    we didn\u2019t even ID the font!</cite>\r\nHuh?"
