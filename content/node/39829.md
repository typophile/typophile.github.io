body: I don't know what to call it, but we often use a singular form of a word and
  it has an implied plural meaning. In this case, the phrase "as it appears in publication".
  You could say "publications", much like you could say "substances abuse" or "customers'
  satisfaction". Is there a term for this that I can use to mine info?

    is any singular noun without a \"the\" in front of it, especially when it's in
    a general sense like your instances."

    help.

  body: "It probably sounds odd to you because you're thinking of concrete \"publications\",
    which is a count noun. We don't tend to say \"three volumes of publication\" the
    way we say \"three sheets of paper\" or \"three grains of rice\". In the phrase
    \"as it appears in publication\", the word \"publication\" belongs in the same
    category as abstract mass nouns like \"science\" and \"typography\"; it refers
    to the <em>act</em> of publishing and the whole of all things ever published everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe
    fact that nouns aren't pluralized when used as modifiers, as in \"substance abuse\"
    and \"dog catcher\", is unrelated."
