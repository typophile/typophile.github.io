  body: wow Tomi, you are pretty fast, 5 days ago you said in another post "Some glyphs
    still need work, and kerning is just in it's infancy, but you get a feel". Thats
    what I call a fast growing, lol. Its a nice one.

  body: "Thanks, guys-\r\n\r\nOver the years I've developed a routine that helps me
    to design a basic characters set wit some speed, which allows me then to go back,
    and review the result without any real loss of production time.\r\n\r\nSome five
    years ago I started wondering if this method was the best one, and experienced
    with other ways of font design, like hand drawing and scanning; drawing in Illustrator,
    and copying and pasting into FontLab; and mixing the order of designing glyphs.
    In the end I kept to my old method.\r\n\r\nI've also made a conscious effort to
    use more time to make a font, and after three or four weeks of tinkering I compared
    the first version to the version I used more time on, and saw no real improvement,
    so once again I kept to my old method.\r\n\r\nFor me one week is about average
    from idea to a finished font. After that it slows down; italics and different
    weights take a lot more time, and finishing a complete font family takes months
    easily."

  body: "Nick; you gave me a courtesy by giving me your critique by e-mail, rather
    than here on the forum, and that was very decent thing to do. I hope you don't
    mind my quoting you here.\r\n\r\nFrom your point of view Tournedot \"looks like
    hand writing, but the repeated details are too consistent for that. Therefore
    the effect is false. Contextualization in OpenType is a new idea that addresses
    this issue. So far it has been used almost exclusively for script faces.\"\r\n\r\nAfter
    some mulling over, I have to disagree. After waiting some twenty years since PostScript,
    we actually have a chance to use ligatures and alternate characters, and you want
    to discourage designers to impliment that possibility. Tournedot is a font, not
    lettering. It is not following traditional type design dogma, but rather looking
    for the boundaries of it (sorry; that sounded suprisingly pompous).\r\n\r\nI understand
    that this new technology can cause the same confusion that happened with lithography
    in 1900'th century, when suddenly any form was possible for printing. We saw the
    same thing with PostScript in the 90's, and with OT, we'll see more.\r\n\r\nEach
    new technology needs to find its limits, before it can find its best qualities.
    This applies to OpenType as well."

  body: "<em>...we actually have a chance to use ligatures and alternate characters,
    and you want to discourage designers to impliment that possibility...</em>\r\n\r\nNo
    I don't. Ligatures and alternates ARE contextual. For instance, one would not
    set \"d with flourish\" when followed by \"l\".\r\nSo I approve of your alternates
    and ligatures!\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I still think you could use alternate glyphs
    to give an impression of the subtle variations in serif form that occur with hand
    lettering, rather than just for alternate letter-shapes.\r\n\r\nActually, you
    needn't even do that: just don't rely so much on cutting-and pasting, but take
    a little more time to hand-craft each glyph individually. The overall effect will
    look more human, less plastic.\r\n\r\n<em>Tournedot is a font, not lettering.
    </em>\r\n\r\nThen why does it look like brush lettering? The swelling of the vertical
    stems towards the baseline, the \"brushy\" serifs that begin and end strokes,
    the non-geometric, organic curves, the softened corners, the casual jauntiness
    of \"g\" and \"y\", the large counter in \"e\"--typical of mid-20th century brush
    lettering, &c, &c.\r\n\r\n<em>It is not following traditional type design dogma,</em>\r\n\r\nYes
    it is.\r\nIt has the traditional regimentation that has generally occurred when
    a hand-lettering style is turned into a font.\r\nFor instance, all the letters
    stand precisely on the baseline in a way that hand lettering never could achieve.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are going to design a typeface which is so strongly informed by hand-lettering,
    why not use available technology to do a better simulation than was possible in
    the past?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you want to make it more \"font-like\", impose
    a greater degree of regularity and stylization; refine it more. For instance,
    make the \"entry\" serif on \"i\" and \"n\" the same.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the
    idea is not fully realized: it is caught between being a simulation of hand lettering
    and being a fully refined and rigorously stylized typeface. \r\n"

    to me it's just another font with some new forms.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry to upset you
    like this, but I stand behind my design; Tournedot is a font for headline use
    with two different stylistic sets."

  body: "Tomi,\r\n\r\nThe design is nice, but i also agree with Nick. The font is
    really caught between types. I see it as a heavily formalized script font. But,
    even that description does not seem right either, since it doesn't flow like a
    script font should.  \r\n\r\nI would call it, as riccardO suggested, a ballpoint
    font, more than anything else.\r\n\r\nThe forms do look nice, and the alternatives
    are a neat thought. \r\n\r\nI do understand what Nick is saying though. You've
    headed in two, possibly three, directions. I think you need to choose just one
    direction.\r\n"

    I can symphatise with it. To me it was just another design needing to get out
    of my head. In fact it was pencil, not a ball point pen that brought this one
    about.\r\n\r\nI know it is not within any conventional type styles, and that was
    the reason I decided to make it. OT features are just extra.\r\n\r\nI saw something
    new, and decided to show it. That's all."
