  this wine label as my example of bad type, but I'm sure by looking at the image,
  you already knew that.\r\n\r\nBasket Case (notice the backwards s) is a cheap wine
  we sell at the restaurant I work at. I'm not sure what type face is being used,
  but it looks to me like its in the curls family. The labels on the rest of the wine
  we sell all use serifs or a pretty script so this one sticks out like a sore thumb.
  I guess who ever design it was trying to make it \"crazy\" like a basket case. I
  understand where they were coming from, but don't think they executed very well.
  The image in the middle is pretty bad too. Its an illustration of a straight jacket,
  in case you were wondering."
