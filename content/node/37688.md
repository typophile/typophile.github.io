body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI have a problem that in my Mac's fontbook, in some Font families,
  single font files all appear as \"Regular\" instead of Bold, Italic... etc\r\nand
  that makes Illustrator and InDesign only reads one single font from the family and
  cancels the others since they all are called Regular.\r\n\r\nIs there possibly any
  fix for this? Is there a mean for me to rename them?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. "
