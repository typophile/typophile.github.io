  body: Some similarities to Cheltenham &#40;the spur on the A, for example&#41;,
    but other details are off. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cheltenham/bold/testdrive.html?s=T+H+E+++U+N+A+P+P+R+O+A+C+H+A+B++L+E&amp;p=24"

    <BR> <BR>&#34;Motor Cycles&#34; may be a different font, or a display variant
    -- note the double serifs on the C, which aren&#39;t in the bolder &#34;unapproachable&#34;
    setting.

  body: It does resemble Cheltenham, but as you noted there are some differences,
    such as the R, and the serifs are not quite right &#40;but close&#41;. <BR> <BR>This
    sems like a good exercise for the McGrew book or the Encyclopaedia of Type Faces
    &#40;Jaspert, et al&#41;. Was this ad in the US or UK? &#40;Guessing the latter&#41;

  body: The ad was run in the U.K. It&#39;s a tricky one, it resembles a few fonts,
    but there are some quirky differences. The ad dates back to 1914, which almost
    makes it an antique face.
