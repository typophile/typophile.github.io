  body: "Thanks for the welcome...\r\n\r\nI've been doing font development for a long
    time, and selling my work for a few years. I'm just now feeling like I need to
    get serious with it ( I feel like I have been faking it really well for a while
    ). So, I bought Fontlab last week because Fontographer (which I've been using
    since 1988 has its limitations), and I feel overwhelmed. Yet, I'm excited to know
    that I have so much more to learn. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping that people in this group,
    can help me learn. I have a host of technical questions. But for now, I just want
    to say I'm looking forward to checking in frequently.\r\n\r\nR"
