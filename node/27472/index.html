  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am working on an Arabic font.
The design is finalized but I am having some problems in making my generated font work on all of the applications.</p>
<p>Example of same application: 
My font is working properly on all Adobe Applications (Indesign ME, Photoshop ME and illustrator ME…), on the contrary, it is showing well in Safari but the glyphs are not linking. The application is not able to attach the glyphs and to substitute the isolated forms with its initial, medial or final form. And also on some application like Firefox it is not showing at all. As in Linotype FontExplorer X, it is also showing properly the glyphs but in the display window the glyphs are not attached also. Only isolated forms are present.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/type-in-indesign1_6738.jpg" alt=""> indesign</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/type-in-browser1_6291.jpg" alt=""> safari</p>
<p>I am generating my fonts as TrueType fonts.
All the glyphs have proper Unicode values.
The names of the Glyphs are Uni&mdash;-, 
(they start with Uni and then the Unicode number of each glyph).
The naming of the font is proper for TrueType and Opentype generation.
The encoding is set as Arabic.</p>
<p>But I still do not know what I am missing?</p>
<p>Any help?</p>

<p>i have read the previous forum that you have pointed too.
so i noticed that AAT format is mentioned.
but also at the end Adam Twardoch said that the MacOSX 10.4&hellip; will support both.</p>
<p>by the way, can you please inform me more about the AAT stuff.
i do not have any prior knowledge in it.</p>
<p>and concerning my font format. i am generating my font as True Type and not as OpenType.</p>
<p>ok

<p>I think in a few releases (eg. Mac OS X Meercat or Mac OS XI “The Oskeye”) your font should work in Apple OS services (Adobe rolls it’s own OT support to ensure cross-platform loveliness). Apple is publicly committed to OT, but they’re <strong>not currently doing OpenType shaping engines that will support complex script languages</strong>.</p>

<p>I was also browsing some Arabic sites both on safari and firefox.
Some sites work on safari and some work on firefox.
Most of the time if an Arabic type in a page is not linking on safari, if you open the same page in firefox it will link properly.</p>
<p>So I was also wondering what is the difference between the two applications.</p>

<p>Yes, but I wouldn&rsquo;t trust as gospel anything an OS vendor tells you at a conference. They&rsquo;ve been known to tell you what you want to hear in order to get free drinks at the bar.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>My guess, fall back - Safari is honoring the font specified in the HTML or CSS and Firefox is selecting a system font.</p>

<p>at first i thought that if the font is not working on safari then it is a problem in my font.
it is good now that i know about the AAT stuff.
i will look more into it.
it is difficult to apply it on my font?</p>
<p>and i was also putting my font in safari to look on the hinting stuff and how my font will look on the web.</p>
<p>anyways, my main concern was about generating my Arabic font properly.</p>
<p>The thing is that also in Linotype FontExplorer X application (in the detailed preview window) my font is also not attached, the glyphs are only in the isolated forms.</p>
<p>So I though that the problem is the same for safari.. and the linotype explorer.
I noticed that the Arabic fonts that are properly attached in the font explorer are also attached in safari.</p>
<p>But maybe the problem is not the same.
Or maybe it is</p>

<p>are you in Lebanon now? 
how is the mood over there?
still able to work normally?</p>
<p>anyways, concerning the naming of the arabic glyphs.
the thing is that normally the arabic glyphs have affi or uni names.</p>
<p>but when i am designing the font, it is easier for me to have my own naming.
so i have made my own arabic encoding with my own personal naming of the glyphs.</p>
<p>this makes my design work much more friendly for me and faster to work in the font.</p>
<p>but when i need to generate the font is it better to make the names as affi or uni&hellip;
since affi is so complicated and there is no logic in it. i prefer to rename my glyphs as uni&hellip;</p>

anyways regarding the Arabic fonts Im just a developer, not a designer, that&rsquo;s i wasnt concerned with naming the glyphs though as you said it makes it easier to work with named glyphs. and thanks for the thread.

<p>I dunno. During those weeks (especially at the very beginning) I was very depressed because I was outside. And when I recently spoke about it to my brother (who is a very different person than me, at least as far as I can tell) he had the same feelings. I suspect it depends on your age range though: the post-war (I mean the real one) generation was probably just scared stiff.</p>
