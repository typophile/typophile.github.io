  appears over the letters and I have to stop to delete them. I cannot figure out
  what I am doing that makes these things appear. What am I doing to cause this, and
  how do I make the guides go away with dragging them away one by one?"

  body: "Hi James,\r\nthis happens when you click the bar right above your glyph in
    the metrics window. When your mouse is over it it will change to a double vertical
    arrow allowing you to drag down a global (red) guide. If you just accidently click
    this bar it will still place a guide. A quick way to remove all guides is to move
    to the guides layer in a glyphs window and right click a ruler bar and choose
    remove guides.\r\nhope this helps,\r\nJosh"
