  body: What OS are you on, and what format of fonts are you building? <BR> <BR>In
    MacRoman encoding, there&#39;s only one slot, and if you want to have both glyphs
    one has to be unencoded. In Unicode or Windows based encodings, put each in its
    proper place. <BR> <BR>If you need to worry about non Adobe Classic Mac apps,
    there are some extra wrinkles, which I&#39;ve long since lost track of. I&#39;m
    sure somebody else will chime in.... <BR> <BR>T

  body: Oh, well that&#39;s easy, then. No reason whatsoever to put the euro in the
    currency slot. Each gets its own slot, and the euro will show up in the right
    place for MacRoman, including on Classic and OS 8/9. <BR> <BR>But you need to
    have both for Windows and full Unicode environments. WinANSI has separate slots
    for the two, and Windows users and folks in full Unicode environments will think
    there&#39;s something wrong if a euro shows up in place of the generic currency
    symbol. <BR> <BR>T

  body: '&#62;Eric, don&#39;t worry, OT fonts &#40;as other fonts based on TrueType
    table structure&#41; have room for 65536 glyphs. It&#39;s enough for all currencies,
    which Unicode knows. I&#39;m not sure, whether anybody needs the original currency
    sign for some purpose. Most Non-Unicode-savvy OS&#39;ies and applications can&#39;t
    handle both currency &#40;00A4&#41; and Euro &#40;20AC&#41; sign in the same time,
    because they excist in &#40;practically&#41; no single 8-bit character set. A
    good rule of thumb: when dealing with OT fonts forget old apps and OS&#39;ies.
    In practice you may put Euro sign in both slots, nobody will hardly complain.'

  body: What Juhani says about non-Unicode-savvy OSes and applications is not true.
    <b>All</b> the Windows codepages for European languages have both euro and currency
    characters in separate slots &#40;Western/WinANSI, Eastern European, Cyrillic,
    Baltic, Turkish, Greek&#41;. Microsoft extended their codepages to add the euro
    many years ago. These codepages are what single-byte fonts and applications work
    with. <BR> <BR>Although the currency symbol has few practical uses as a currency
    symbol, a lot of folks have ended up using it as a bullet or other kind of dingbat.
    Switching fonts and having it turn into a euro symbol would be a Bad Thing, and
    I have heard Windows users complain about it in fonts made by people who didn&#39;t
    know better. <BR> <BR>There is no reason whatsoever to put a euro &#40;U&#43;20AC&#41;
    symbol in the currency &#40;U&#43;00A4&#41; slot in an OpenType CFF font. For
    Classic and OS 8/9, the ATM driver maps the euro to the right slot in MacRoman
    for both viewing and printing. <BR> <BR>But there are good reasons NOT to double-map
    the euro symbol, as described above. So, for anybody asking for advice, I strongly
    discourage it, just as I would strongly discourage putting a euro in the slot
    intended for the letter E. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: if i remember my reading of <i>Elements</i> correctly, the currency sign is
    used as a place holder for where a &#40;unspecified&#41; currency symbol should
    go. So though my opinion doesn&#39;t pull as much weight as Mr. Phinney&#39;s,
    i&#39;d have to say that putting the Euro symbol in the currency slot would be
    a bad thing.

  body: Paul, you&#39;re right about the specified purpose of the currency sign. Mind
    you, I think it gets used more as a bullet or dingbat than in this intended manner.
    <BR> <BR>But what&#39;s with this Mr. Phinney business? As long as you don&#39;t
    mind me calling you Paul, you can call me Thomas or Tom or T. <BR> <BR>Cheers,
