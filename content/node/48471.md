body: "I have to read a lot of information set in Stone Sans, Serif, and Informal.
  While I can handle Sans and Serif, the Informal cut hurts my eyes. (Especially when
  set as body text.)\r\n\r\nWhat I need to figure out is, Why? What is wrong with
  Stone Informal as compared to the other more elegant and usable Stone family variants?\r\n\r\nHow
  I see it being used is for children's material in a magazine. The \"adult\" material
  uses Serif for the majority of the body text and Sans for smaller articles and sidebars.\r\n\r\nBut
  the kids articles get Informal everything, and it hurts. I can't quite figure it
  out, but it hurts.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

  body: "I can't find my copy (it's possible it didn't make it through my latest Book
    Purge), but if you feel like spending $2.60 (used) on Amazon you can pick up <em>On
    Stone</em>, which I'm sure covers his rationale.\r\n\r\nThere's also a funny sample
    of the lowercase \"r\" from \"Stone Extra Informal\" that has a puppet face for
    an ear in the July 1988 issue of <em>Fine Print</em>, reprinted in <em>Fine Print
    on Type</em>, $9 used on Amazon. In that article Stone writes:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"I
    noticed I was frequently receiving letters and memos printed out in Times Roman
    on the laser printer. I had the feeling that these messages were probably not
    for me, or if they were, that they had come from the IRS. I realized that as laser
    printing technology became more commonplace, there would be an increasing need
    for typefaces suited to personal communications generated by a computer.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>\"There
    was no historical model for these Informal designs, but I had several basic ideas
    to start with. I thought first that they should be related in some way to handwriting
    and that they should have a more dynamic, rhythmical character than formal text
    typefaces. The branching used in the lower case letters abdgpqhmn is one such
    cursive characteristic.\"\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\n"
