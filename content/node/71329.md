body: Does anyone know of a method or macro that is capable of snapping nodes to a
  defined grid? I have some pixel fonts that have a few minute errors and this would
  make things a lot easier. Any suggestions? I searched for a macro but I was unable
  to find one that would do this.

  body: I think I read somewhere you can set the number of units in one em to match
    the number of pixels.

  body: "If your grid units are a factor of the original UPM (which is usually 1000)
    you can do the following:\r\n\r\nChange the UPM to UPM/x where x=the distance
    between grid points. Et voil\xE0, all minor errors are gone, as long as the adjusted
    UPM is an integer. Once you've done this, you can scale back up to the original
    UPM value without any rounding errors.\r\n\r\nSo if your grid units are 5 apart,
    shrink the UPM to 200, and then grow back to 1000 and all your points end up being
    on multiples of 5."
