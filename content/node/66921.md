    Doesn't look like a pay font to me, at least not a font I would pay for)"

  body: "It's one small part of a design, but the customer wants a new version, different
    writing but the exact same font.\r\n\r\nNormally I keep a live version of any
    text outside the artboard, but somehow in this case I did not. I still have the
    original .ai\r\n\r\nWhen I inherited this work-station, there were over four thousand
    fonts activated- over the last year, I've been trying to get rid of as many as
    I can. (the previous user installed most of dafont's inventory, and years of other
    free fonts, on top of an ancient copy of Adobe font folio and a bitstream collection).
    Somewhere I have a backup of all of these fonts, but I've already gone through
    about two thouand of them, without any luck."

  body: That would make waaay more than 4.000 fonts. Even Dafont seems to have dropped
    that ugly beast. Do you think your customer would notice if you used something
    similar?

    at medium weight looks to be the closest match to your font, though it has a cleaner,

    over 1,300 and it's already tough wading through it all."
