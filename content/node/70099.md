    in, who's the publication aimed at?

  body: We need some additional information before could give you any advice. Page
    size? Just text or it will mix graphics? It's a technical, objective style of
    text? Colors? Kind of print? Type size limitations? InDesign version?

    thankful when you need to change up a typeface or font size.\r\n"

    paragraph style sheets, character style sheets, etc?  \r\n\r\nDoes your client
    have any style guidelines you need to follow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Best advice for anything with many images is to batch them in Photoshop to
    72dpi to use as placeholders for the real images, better for me than the coarse
    display options. If you use the same names for the files you can just replace
    the packaged image folder with the high resolution folder when layout is complete
    and the links won't break. Perhaps the latest InDesign copes well anyway, on my
    laptop it makes a big difference.\r\n\r\nStyle sheets, master pages and baseline
    grids to keep everything easy.\r\n"
