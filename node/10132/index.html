  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">OK, this is an odd one: I'm currently designing proposals for an engineering firm. We respond to RFPs (Request for Proposals), that often specify &quot;No font smaller than 12 pt.&quot; Since we have a lot to say, I've been forced to choose typefaces on the basis of character size. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I hear your sighs &hellip; but it's a paying gig, and those are kinda hard to find in this place and time.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, Perpetua is my current favorite for serif font; it's so tiny that we have to ad &quot;This proposal formatted in 12 pt Perpetua&quot; on the cover letter. The problem is that any sans I use looks huge next to it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have a vague memory of tables that listed &quot;characters per pica&quot; for different typefaces at different sizes; are those still around, or did they die w/ the advent of WYSIWYG? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, if anyone has any suggestions &ndash; both in serif and sans &ndash; I'd be grateful.

		<div class="commentbody">I am not sure what you are after, but Futura has  smaller x-height than most sans-serifs. Also the original (not ITC) Kabel. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vesta at GerardUnger.com is impressively readable for a sans. Myriad condensed is nice, as is Meta. Benton Sans from Fontbureau (related to Trade Gothic, Franklin, etc) has a number of condensed versions. No sans is as readable for text as any good text serif, in my opinion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You're trying to strike a balance between apparent size, economy and style. What you should note is: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) A font with a smaller x-height does take up less room at a given point size, but at the expense of apparent size. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) The requirement for 12 point (probably) comes from a desire for a minimum apparent size; if you &quot;cheat&quot; by using a font with a small x-height, it's going to come down to them saying &quot;but it's too small&quot; and you saying &quot;but it's 12 point!&quot; You need to try to predict which way that argument would end up going. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) The larger the x-height, the more economical the face, and the more legible, but also the less readable. (Although there's certainly a lower limit to the x-height ito readability). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems that one thing you can do is choose a sans with a small x-height (like Seria), but that's assuming they won't balk at the apparent size (even though it's 12 point). Another possibility is to use a sans with a &quot;normal&quot; x-height but set the Perpetua larger (but then things might not fit). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If neither of those work, you could always just say less. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

Not small in x-height, but just small for its size. (In order to make Gill Sans visually the same size as 12 pt Perpetua, you have to reduce Gill to 10 pt.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with Perpetua is that it's a bit spindly for this application. (I create these proposals on a 4-color Xerox.) Another problem is that if I use a contrasting san serif for headlines, it looks huge next to the perpetua, even at 12 pt. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But now that I've used it once, the engineers won't let me use a &quot;larger&quot; face. So I'm looking for a similarly &quot;small&quot; face that is more robust (thicker hairlines), plus a companion san serif, to be used in the proposals and other printed material. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(I hope that made more sense&hellip;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll check out the suggestions already mentioned.

		<div class="commentbody">This has turned out to be pretty difficult; it's odd to choose a font based on visual size at a certain point measure, and type samples aren't set up for that sort of comparison. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So I dug out my copy of Adobe Font folio, to see if I have Kinnesis (I don't.) But while I was looking, I did find a PDF with a listing of all Adobe's fonts (at the time), plus their average-characters-per-pica measure. I had to do a bit of work to get it into Excel, but now I can sort by name and by measure. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Centaur came up as an option, but it has many of the same issues as perpetua. I love Electra, but it looks wrong at 12 pt: it's just too big. I'm totally into Octavian &hellip; but it doesn't have a bold or bold italic, which I really need. (I want to see if I can figure out some alternate font for emphasis, maybe a san-serif&hellip;) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, in the Sans world, Bell Centennial Address came in as the smallest font I've tested, &amp; surprisingly readable. Ocean Sans &amp; Formata have condensed versions that fit a lot of characters into a given space, but I'm not sure they are going to work in this case. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If anyone has any other suggestions, I'd love to hear them. thanks!</div>
