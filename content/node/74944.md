body: "Hi,\r\nI have just joined Typophile and have taken the tag of this forum to
  heart: \"anything goes\". I also add that I'm definitely not a \"fly by nighter\"
  as I was friends with Mac McGrew and actually provided one of the specimens for
  his American Typefaces book. \r\n\r\nI am a graphic designer (specializing in typography--many
  years), a fine art photographer, and web designer. I wish now to take my love of
  letters to the next level and experiment with type design. After much browsing and
  reading I have found the DTL Bezier Master. Given that I am so green (very bright
  green in fact) I want to know if this is a valid place to start. My plan is to create
  a simple face to begin to learn the skill of type design. Is this program the place
  to start. \r\n\r\nI need also add that I am poor, on social security, and teaching
  a beginning graphic design course at the local college here. I also looked at the
  TypeTool 3 which is considerably cheaper and has an academic discount program as
  well. But, my heart leans to the DTL tool.\r\n\r\nI also want to join atypi -- but
  being late in the year, I would prefer to wait until the new membership year begins
  in January. Does anyone know if that membership includes any discounts with DTL?\r\n\r\nI
  would welcome advice on my venture from anyone willing to help. And I thank you
  for taking the time to read this now.\r\n\r\nClair"

    and experienced type & software developers. I\u2019m sure it would be a worthy
    program, but I don\u2019t know how suited it might be to a beginner.\r\n\r\nFontLab
    Studio is, by far, the more commonly used tool by the professionals that I know
    and work with. TypeTool is a pared down version of FontLab Studio and provides
    a good upgrade path in terms of skill sets (and license also, iirc).\r\n\r\nRegarding

  body: "Kent --\r\nThank you very much for your reply. I think I will put my toes
    in the water with TypeTool 3 jut for a place to start. \r\n\r\nThe reason I became
    interested in DTL is because the interface seemed, at first glance, to be rather
    intuitive in many instances.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for the atypi link. They offer
    a lot, but apparently have no association with any makers of font creation software.
    Perhaps that will come.\r\n\r\nAnd, I'm very glad to \"meet\" you -- and to know
    that you are the designer of Whitman. I ran across that face a couple of years
    ago and thought it a strong and readable face. I was particularly interested in
    the calligraphic touches.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks.\r\n"

  body: Just catching up with news here, but noted your post because we both live
    in Vermont. I have used Fontographer for many years and the new update is great.
    I recommend it for many reasons. Also TypeTool 3 is very good and a great introductory
    program. FontLab Studio is the best of all. Each program has something to recommend
    it but I personally would start with Fontographer. Best of luck to you.
