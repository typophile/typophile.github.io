      i noticed that right after i posted, when i looked them up on Wikipedia. i guess
      they felt inspired by the Italians? i always thought those were so cool when
      i was a kid on vacation in Italy. makes me miss those days when each country
      you visited had their own money.. it was part of the whole vacation thing, really.
      the Euro is more convenient perhaps, but it was way more fun when you could
      have marks, lire, francs, etc."

    Escudos coins</a> (100$ was roughly 0,50\u20AC). Then later, in 1991, appeared

    I have one of those cool bimetal Escudos. I used to collect coins. Then I lost
    my best batch (which I kept in a tin mint box) during a visit to a toy store (being
    a typical dumb kid I insisted on carrying my collection around with me) and got
    discouraged. I still have a lot of cool ones though. For one thing people seemed
    to ignore my discouragement and kept giving me exotic coins to collect.\r\n\r\nCoins
    with holes: I have a really nice\r\none from Oman (I think) which has a\r\nhole
    as well as a wavy edge.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm pretty sure I still have that NYC subway
    one too.\r\n\r\n> I\u2019d call them Armenian numerals.\r\n\r\nBut since other
