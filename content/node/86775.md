  much do you sell a font to a company for exclusive rights?\r\n\r\nI am in contact
  with a company that wants to purchase from me.\r\n\r\nIt is one font. Not a \"family.\"\r\n\r\nThanks"

    Then decide how much of that you are willing to give up in order to get a lump
    sum up front. '

    many seats the will make the font available to? Also the company's clients?

  body: "I don't think this is something that you can logically and quickly figure
    out.\r\nIt's the kind of business evaluation that you have to intuit by familiarity
    with, and study of, the market, and through experience.\r\nIt's important to have
    an understanding of your foundry's place in the market, and your client's.\r\nFor
    starters, take a look at a large number of license agreements from different foundries,
    to determine what sort of licence will work for you and your client. This should
    be determined before you quote.\r\nParticularly, consider \"Enterprise\" licenses.
    \r\nOther than that, I recommend you imagine what a foundry whose work you respect
    might charge, and double it.\r\n"

  body: "You should start by coming up with a number that provides you with a living
    wage. What that is will depend, but typically some formula consisting of the number
    of hours it'll take you to do the work * your hourly rate (which is a whole other
    formula).\r\n\r\nThat's your baseline. At that price, you'll at least know it
    was worth your time. You can then raise or lower it from there based on all sorts
    of other criteria, but at least you'll have a benchmark. "

  body: "Good advice for calculating an hourly fee to charge for work, but totally
    irrelevant for calculating license fees. \r\n\r\nPerpetual Non-exclusive, and
    Perpetual Exclusive are two very different things.\r\n\r\nNick's advice on surveying
    the market is a good place to start.\r\n\r\nDTF, I think your advice is off-base
    as well."
