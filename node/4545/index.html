		<div class="commentbody">Geoff: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the first time in a while that I think Avant Garde is an appropriate choice for logotype. As you indicated in your original post, this is a work-in-progress, and as the rest of the posts indicate, you still have a lot of work to do. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like Avant Garde because it is a clean typeface which is appropriate for the golfing community. I also like the implications of balls (we all know what I mean here) created by the circular letterforms. I would suggest exploring more subtle approaches to manipulating the type than what you have done, thus far. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;W&quot; with the &quot;R-ball&quot; implies a bouncing ball, which I don't think is the most beautiful shot to highlight. If I was showcasing a shot I think it would either be a long drive, or a perfect putt. The drive would require an arc and the putt would require a hole. I don't know if either of these would work into this logo, but you might sketch out a few ideas. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The &quot;L-club&quot; looks much more like a hockey stick to me. That starts alluding to Happy Gilmore, which albeit is a classic in my eyes, but I don't know how the more serious golfing community views that one. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Probably the most simple solution is to put some dimples in the &quot;O&quot; and call it good, but my guess is that the &quot;O&quot; in golf has been used as a golf ball hundreds of times over (but I can't support that with any research at this time). As I mentioned above, I like the concept of implied balls and subtle letterform manipulation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good luck! I'm anxious to see what you come up with. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aloha! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott</div>

So who's to say that it has to be upscale and stiff, IMO, this is incorrect. I'm not saying total street is appropriate, but think about P. Diddy. He golfs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chase, now you're just showing off (it takes one to know one :-). Geoff, translation: lachrymal = teardrop-shaped. Pretty rare term. Although useful. But even though I agree with Chase that an ear (what the structure in question is normally called) would help make it more of a &quot;g&quot;, of course it doesn't have to be lachrymal, and (as Chase says) it probably shouldn't be. And virtually all binocular &quot;g&quot;s in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any<!-- raw HTML omitted --> font (not just serif) have an ear.

		<div class="commentbody">Geoff, to be honest, I didn't really care for the capital G I did either. This last iteration is nice and simple, but I feel that with a simple marque like that you need stronger type. I concur with your use of a sans face, but if you're straddling the upscale/classy set as well as the contemporary and tech-savvy, you may need something with a bit more presence.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think something simple like Univers Extra Condensed might work, IMO a face with non-circular bowls would complement a circular marque nicely. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant: Sorry, sometimes I don't know my tail from my ear <!-- raw HTML omitted --> I like the teddy-bear too</div>

		<div class="commentbody">G'day,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is what Ive come up with so far&hellip; I like the idea of using the ball marque as the &quot;o&quot; in the &quot;golfweb&quot; logotype.

This is crucial for the designs I have in mind for the business card, letterhead and envelope. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Personally, I like number 4 with the avant garde typeface I think I prefer a circluar typeface as it complements the marque.

You've got a strong mark and I agree with Darrel, that this new element is detracting from it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A couple of random thoughts if you do want to try to make it work: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1 Your idea might work OK on the bizcard if you completed the silhouette of the tee to bleed off of the bottom of the card. This gives it some purpose (clarifying the tee of the mark) vs. just repeating the existing mark in a weaker fashion. If you did this, you might also try typing golfweb really small and repeating it across the bottom edge of the card so that it is like grass. Also, centering it isn't very interesting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2 Maybe you can type golfweb really small and repeat it so that it floods the card (grass), except for a round circle that represents a golf ball. You can even make the type get a little larger from top to bottom representing perspective. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&hellip;just brainstorming thoughts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aloha!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like it! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To be super nitpicky: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> - does your client have green toner in their printers?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> - I'm a fan of one-sided business cards for usability's sake. I'd suggest moving the logotype 'golfweb' to the info side of the card (leave the icon on the back). And then do *not* use the same typeface for the person's name. Even with the two-side approach, I think using the type for the name dilutes the ID system too much. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- while not as critical as the b-card, I might swap sides on the envolope. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The golfball looks great.
