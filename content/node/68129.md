body: "Good evening fellow typophiles,\r\n\r\nMy name is Paul Cooley, I am third year
  student of Graphic Design at OTIS College of Art and Design. I have recently delved
  into the world of type design and am absolutely in love. The typeface below is an
  attempt to combine the languages of Geometric and humanist sans serif typefaces,
  especially focusing on attributes of Gill Sans, Futura, Akzidenz Grotesk, and Helvetica.
  I wanted to treat this as a sort of \"dream team\" of different attributes that
  I feel work the best in these examples and try and synthesize them into one cohesive
  face.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plainlowercasetiny_3915.jpg]\r\n\r\nRight
  now there is only the lowercase characters which I will continue to focus on in
  the coming weeks and months. There are some proportion and unity issues and some
  characters (e, g,s,t,x,z) are proving to be challenging. Regardless, this is an
  exciting learning process that I hope will improve my abilities.\r\n\r\nThis is
  after a few months of work and research and is still in the developmental phase...so
  nothing is permanent. In other words feel free to throw out any ideas or criticisms.
  Also, If their are any faces that you would recommend I look at...please let me
  know, I interested in casting my net as broad as possible.\r\n\r\nA full-size pdf
  is at the bottom...thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Paul,\r\nAll right! Not bad after just a few months!\r\n\r\nIt's hard
    to tell from the jpg (there's no PDF), but it seems that /m/ and /x/ are too wide
    (compare /w/), /r/ needs a braver flag, /s/ and /z/ look out of balance, /t/ is
    too narrow. Colour of /g/ is too heavy.\r\n\r\nA word of advice: don't wait too
    long to make a start with designing the capitals. Sometimes it helpes designing
    the lc having a sort of guide in caps, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nAs for looking at
    other fonts, don't limit yourself. I'm a amateur type designer myself and I get
    my technical inspiration from looking at all possible fonts I encounter. Some
    fonts are beautifully made but stylistic I don't like'm. Other fonts look fantastic
    but are constructed awfully. Nevertheless I study them all just to see how they're
    designed.\r\n\r\nKeep going! Nevermind you're getting your inspiration from the
    great names, it's just like how I started."

  body: "Oh The PDF is up now...sorry, I must have forgot to upload it!\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the keen insight. I definitely agree with all your comments. The /g/ is simply
    a beast. Your notes on the /m/ and /x/ are spot on. The /s/ is proving to be a
    very difficult letterform...but I'm up for the challenge.\r\n\r\nRegarding design
    of the caps, I definitely do want to get started soon, as the main reason I wanted
    to design a font like this was because I love many of the characteristics of Gill
    and Futura's capitals...but I feel the lowercase just don't quite work for me
    personally. So I agree with looking at all types of fonts, even ones I'm not \"into
    to\" per se.\r\n\r\nThanks for all your input! I'm glad to see such a lively community
    here!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Judging from your PDF /s/ is too big (you're absolutly right, /s/ is a b***h).
    It seems that /m/ and /n/'s bowls are higher than /p/'s en /q/'s? I think you've
    got the contrast (thick-thin) in /v/ and /y/ mixed up. /c/ has vertical finials,
    whereas /e/ has a horizontal finial, and /s/ diagonal. I understand that you're
    making a mix of all great typefaces, but I think that when you make all finials
    more or less the same, either vertical OR horizontal OR diagonal, you'll get a
    more coherent design.\r\n\r\nTry setting a longer text like 'the quick brown...'
    so I can judge it better.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, I've got a design up for
    crits myself, check it [[http://typophile.com/node/67608|here]]"

  body: "Hi Paul\r\nThis has a nice weight to it. I love the c and the stick and bowl
    shapes. I actually don't mind the mix of horizontal/vertical terminals between
    c and e but I'd recommend s has vertical ones and a horizontal I think. I think
    your overshoot is quite variable and a bit large overall (noticeably on b, m,
    n and u).\r\ng is really nice already, but have you tried lifting the bowl slightly
    above the baseline? Sometimes that's a trick that works to balance the counters
    better, but not too much of course. \r\nThe bowl of a looks quite rough, perhaps
    there are too many nodes in there?\r\ne looks wide and I'd shave a tiny bit of
    weight off the crossbar. \r\nHood of f could be wider.\r\ni and k are great.\r\ns,
    again, looks like too many nodes, or needs smoothing. It's also too large. I'm
    sure you'll get there!\r\nI think I'd make the top of t a bit taller.\r\nv looks
    clotty in the middle, pull down the centre node of the counter. Also perhaps the
    whole shape could be narrower.\r\nUphill stroke of x could do with some offset.\r\ny
    is neat.\r\nz is falling left.\r\n\r\nI'd agree with starting caps and numerals
    before trying to get all the lowercase working perfectly. Good luck :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "First off, thanks for noting the variable overshoots...I just looked at it
    all in fontlab again and there is definitely a substantial difference in a variety
    of the characters mentioned.\r\n\r\nFinials-I agree with both of you in a way.
    I still haven't fully committed to how I want to work these out. I do really like
    the way the c is starting to feel, and I feel that that attribute can be carried
    throughout. It's just going to take some experimenting to see what works.\r\n\r\nAnd
    omashuisje I will definitely be checking out your work as soon as I get some rest...its
    4am in LA...and this site and my font have kept me up!\r\n\r\nI did take a glance
    and the /q/ and the /P/ are immediately appealing to me. I'm liking the open counter
    idea. Any notion that brings in more negative space is lovely in my book.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for all the astute observations you two.\r\n\r\n-Paul"
