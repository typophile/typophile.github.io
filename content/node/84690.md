  and I need to recreate these decals that were on it. I'm curious as to what this
  font is though for the words 'Piano House'\r\n\r\nIf anyone here can help me I would
  be very relieved. Otherwise I'm going to have to trace it and that just wont do.
  My apologies I used my phone to take the pic."
