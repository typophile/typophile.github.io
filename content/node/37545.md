  have an italic font that but when printing the roman font is used. It my own font
  that I'm testing that has roman and Italic versions, in Indesign the italic font
  shows up as it should but them when I try to print it the roman version of the font
  is used.\r\n\r\nThis has never happened before and I can't work out what it might
  be.\r\n\r\nRr\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hmm, could it be that the two fonts have the same Postscript ID number that
    makes this conflict? I hade a similar problem, and it turned out to be this problem.
    Just take away the ID number from both fonts, and see if it helps \u2013 if that
    is the case.\r\n\r\nHow is the fonts named, btw?"

  body: "Goran, \r\n\r\nYou were right, somehow the fonts got the same ID number.\r\n\r\nAll
    fixed now thanks.\r\n\r\nOn this point do the fonts need a Postscript ID number,
    and if they do how do I set them. I normally leave this field blank. \r\n\r\n\r\nRr"

  body: "No, they don't. When working in Fontographer long ago, I'd put in a 0 (\"zero\"),
    which caused the number line to be commented out. I forget exactly what, in FontLab,
    turns the whole thing into a comment line, but it can be done.\r\n\r\nBTW, we
    also use to assign our own, unique names to Type 1 fonts in the old days. Some
    RIPs would cache fonts, and if your font was slightly different but had the same
    name, the printer's RIP might use the wrong font (or metrics). Our New Baskerville
    roman, for instance, was named B0500000, with a commented-out font ID number.
    I've been assured this doesn't happen anymore, but we still do something similar
    with modified OT fonts."
