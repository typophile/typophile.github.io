    Edit-A-Bit: Sorry, You are right, it doesnt seem to be available any longer. I
    wonder what happened. 'Metron' has been digitised by Frantisek Storm, in 2004,
    or so. But it vanished from his site, as well. Very strange. Maybe you want to
    contact Frantisek Storm directly? Oh, And if you do so, please reply in here with
    what happened. Thank you. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"
