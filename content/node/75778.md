  kind of love the font and would like to use it in a logo, unfortunately the price
  tag is almost as much as I'm getting paid for the logo so it's not really a feasible
  option, especially since I'm only 40% sure I'll end up using it. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts

  body: "Good suggestions guys, I agree Seria Sans isn't quite the same. Several of
    the others could work though, not a perfect replacement but if they were I suppose
    Dalton Maag couldn't charge $500+ for the family. :) \r\n\r\nI'll start playing
    with those since I already have all but Elisar, but keep em coming if you think
    of anything else.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
