body: "FontBook in Mac OS 10.5 is reporting an improperly structured kern table upon
  installation of Aviano. I recently overhauled the entire family, including the kerning,
  and it is now based off of a Multiple Master. All font generated from the master
  are affected. Class based kerning is used extensively, and I expand kerning upon
  export. The export expands the kerning to about 1000 pairs. Microsoft Font Validator
  reports no issues, and Fontlab reports no issues with the structure upon export,
  and the Kerning Assistance dialog reports no problems. I have filed reports with
  Fontlab.\r\n\r\nIs anyone familiar with this issue? What additional information
  can I provide to help solve the issue?\r\n\r\nThank you for the help,\r\n\r\nJDooley\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture

  body: OT-CFF fonts should not have a 'kern' table. The kerning in OT-CFF fonts is
    handled by the 'kern' feature found in the 'GPOS' table.

  body: "Miguel made a good point.\r\nBut whatever FontBook's validation criteria
    are, both the declaration as \"serious error\" and \"structure and content\" are
    misleading except if the kern table is really built incorrectly."

  body: "I turned off the expansion of the class based kerning upon export and FontBook
    validated the font as correctly formed.\r\n\r\nThis creates another problem, as
    some applications still don't support class based kerning. I have passed this
    information onto FontLab support.\r\n\r\nThank you for the assistance and insight.\r\n\r\nJDooley"

  body: "The OpenType specification does not permit the \"kern\" table in PostScript-flavored
    OpenType fonts, though the Apple specification does. But this obviously is not
    the problem since FontBook permits some OTF fonts with a \"kern\" table but chokes
    on others. \r\n\r\nFontBook has been known for false-flagging many situations,
    and this seems like one of them. \r\n\r\nI believe this is an Apple problem, not
    a problem with your font. You might want to install the Apple FontTools from\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/textfonts/Fonttools/\r\nand
    check your font with ftxvalidator, and see what it reports. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam"

  body: "Thank you Adam, I will check into that.\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree that it is
    probably an error with FontBook validation and not FontLab, since users rely so
    heavily on FontBook, FontLab might want to look into the error or coordinate with
    Apple on this issue. I doubt that my font is the only one effected.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Jeremy, \r\n\r\nas far as I can tell, this problem has been fixed in more
    recent versions of Mac OS X. I just tested your font in Mac OS X 10.5.6 and FontBook
    did not complain at all. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"
