body: "I'm trying to convert a collection of Windows Postscript files to OTF on OSX.
  For that, I decided to go with Fontforge because I can batch-process them with scripts
  in the terminal. I know little bash-scripting and no Python, but have been able
  to modify a script on the Fontforge site to do this: http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/scripting-tutorial.html
  \ \r\nHowever, as it is, I need to modify a lot of the files by hand to get the
  Style to display as I like it, like \"Bold Italic\" instead of \"BoldItalic\" with
  no spaces. So, I've looked into the documentation and tried to use the GetTTFName()
  and SetTTFName() functions to do this. I can get it to set the Style (subfamily)
  just fine, but I get an empty string when trying to read the existing style. Opening
  the font in the GUI, it displays the Style under the TTF section, so it is there.
  What I am experimenting with:\r\n\r\nstyle = GetTTFName(0x409,2)\r\n    Fontfamily=GetTTFName(0x409,1)\r\n
  \   Print(Fontfamily)\r\n    Print(style)\r\n    if (style!=\"\") #use 'case' ?\r\n
  \   \tif (style==\"BoldItalic\")\r\n    \t\tstyle=\"Bold Italic\"\r\n    \telseif
  (style==\"BoldCondensed\")\r\n    \t\tstyle=\"Bold Condensed\"\r\n    \telseif (style==\"BoldCondItalic\")\r\n
  \   \t\tstyle=\"Bold Italic Condensed\")\r\n    \telseif (style==\"SemiBoldItalic\")\r\n
  \   \t\tstyle=\"SemiBold Italic\"\r\n    \telseif (style==\"BlackItalic\")\r\n    \t\tstyle=\"Black
  Italic\"\r\n    \telseif (style==\"ExtraBoldItalic\")\r\n    \t\tstyle=\"ExtraBold
  Italic\"\r\n    \telseif (style==\"MediumItalic\")\r\n    \t\tstyle=\"Medium Italic\"\r\n
  \   \telseif (style==\"LightItalic\")\r\n    \t\tstyle=\"Light Italic\"\r\n    \telseif
  (style==\"HeavyItalic\")\r\n    \t\tstyle=\"Heavy Italic\"\r\n    \tendif \r\n    \tSetTTFName(0x409,2,style)\r\n
  \   endif\r\n    Generate($argv[i]:r + format)\r\n\r\nI'm aware there would be cleaner
  ways of doing it, like using Case, if Bash supports it, or converting it to Python,
  but for now I'm keeping it simple. Ideally, the script would look for a capital
  letter in the Style string and add a space before it where it isn't the first letter.\r\nIn
  any case, the above doesn't work, as GetTTFName() always returns an empty string.
  The parameters for the Set and GetTTFName() function is referring to is\r\nhttp://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_name.html#lang3\r\nand
  \r\nhttp://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_name.html#enc4\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone here know enough Bash scripting, in particularly with Fontforge, to see the
  problem?\r\n"

  body: "ok, I established that Fontforge uses its own form of scripting language,
    described here: http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/scripting.html\r\nbut that still
    doesn't explain why GetTTFName(0x409,2) returns an empty string, when it clearly
    has the TTF subfamily set when you open it up. Fontforge also does Python scripting.
    but I know virtually nothing of it, and it would be too difficult and timeconsuming
    to learn it just for this.\r\nI guess there is nothing for it but to open up each
    newly-generated font and fixing it by hand."

  body: "Postscript fonts don't have a names table, even for TTF names FontForge seems
    to return empty strings for TTF names corresponding to PostScript names (i.e.
    what you see in the PS Names tab), instead you can use the builtin variables:\r\n\r\nOpen($1)\r\nPrint($fontname)\r\nPrint($fullname)\r\nPrint($familyname)\r\n\r\nStyle
    is usually what is after the hyphen in $fontname, you can then used SetTTFname()
    to set the new values as you like."

    the Adobe FDK for OpenType package. It's a console application, and you can specify
    the \"name\" table entries in the feature definition file or the project file.
