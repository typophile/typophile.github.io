  do not email me the font in case <BR>you have it. I simply need to know who made
  it &#40;his <BR>or her email address&#41;, when, and &#34;why&#34;/how. <BR> <BR><A

  <BR> <BR>What I know is that it&#39;s the font used for <BR>the identity of the

    it gets: <BR>the URLs are just GIFs &#40;no HTML even&#41;, and the GIFs are 4-bit
    gray, <BR>not large either in K or pixel dimensions... <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Yeah, it&#39;s odd. It crashes Netscape 4.7 every time... &#40;on my Mac
    running OS 9&#41;. IE has no problem. <BR> <BR>As much as I am inclined to defend
    the underdog, I think it&#39;s time the world retired NetScape. <BR> <BR>Sorry
    I can&#39;t help with the type specimen. It is quite nice. <BR> <BR>//joe '
