body: "Hi everyone. I have been searching and search for fonts like this and it's
  been pretty difficult. So, I come here for your expertise. I apologize in advance
  if I am not good at explaining/wording things.\r\n\r\nThe best font I've found thus
  far is Galapagos BRK\r\n\r\nhttp://www.allfreefonts.com/font-539-galapogos_brk.html\r\n\r\nMore
  specifically, I am using the word \"know\" in all lowercase:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.allfreefonts.com/custom-thumb.html?d=539&fontfilename=galapogo.ttf&custom=know\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  features that appeal to me are:\r\n\r\n1. Sans-serif\r\n\r\n2. No flags on letters
  like \"n\" (or whatever that straight part extending on the top left of the letter
  is called)\r\n\r\n3. All letters follow the \"n\" form. So, the \"w\" is like a
  double upside down \"n\" and the bottom of the \"k\" is \"n\" as well. The \"o\"
  is basically 2 \"n\" against one another, although I am more lenient on the \"o\"
  not following suit perfectly (as long as it flows). \r\n\r\n4. This goes along with
  #2 but basically 99% of all fonts have the \"k\" and \"w\" as sharp. Instead of
  the \"k\" looking like an \"h\" they have 2 straight lines making them up. The \"w\"
  ends up looking like double \"v\" rather than a double \"u\" and it kills it.\r\n\r\n5.
  Something bold please. It'll be used for a logo\r\n \r\n6. If it were free for commercial
  use... that'd be great. If not, at least inexpensive to buy with a license that
  allows me to use the lettering for a logo.\r\n\r\nAny and all help would be greatly
  appreciated. Thanks!"

    hard to make your own, if it's just those four letters.

  body: "Well, I might be using the font for a few other words as well (although this
    is the main word). So, a font with some other letters is helpful.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    at this point, I guess I could make my own. I'm not too confident with that and
    wanted to see some other examples of this done. If I did want to create my own...
    is there any free software available for something like this? I don't need much
    here, so I can't justify an expensive software purchase."

  body: "The only thing I don't really like about it is the face that the letters
    aren't symmetrical. There is a pointier side. You can see it very clearly on the
    o, but that stylistically is there on all the letters. I have tried copy and pasting
    the softer edges onto the letters using paint, and I like it better. However,
    me doing that on paint is not very professional-looking. \r\n\r\nAdditionally,
    I just wonder if there are other styles I would like if I were exposed to them.
    Maybe letters that were wider, or with flat edges, or something.\r\n\r\nRegardless,
    I like this font. But it isn't perfect. \r\n\r\nIn terms of adjusting it myself...
    what would be a good program to use?"

  body: "Usually I like to keep the brand name font as the only instance of that font,
    and use a complimentary font for secondary text.  It is also a great idea to use
    customized lettering for a logo.  In terms of the legal stuff, it is ok to modify
    the letters to create a logo that is just vector shapes (using Adobe Illustrator
    or Inkscape for example), but in this case not ok to modify the letters to create
    a slightly different font.  Anyway, here are a few other ideas:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/prosper/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/4thfebruary/bladi-two-4f/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bogusky2/squircle/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gravitart/badona/\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps!"
