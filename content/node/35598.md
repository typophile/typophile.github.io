  first TypeCon workshop. The workshop, on Math fonts, took place on the Microsoft
  campus. In true TypeCon tradition we over-ran by an hour, but on the plus side the
  adjoining cafe was closing just as we came out, so we all got free BBQ!\r\n\r\nThe
  weather is beautiful and the mountain is out - made the commute over the 520 bridge
  more than bearable. "

    bags full to the brim with goodies like type specimens of Arno Pro and Beorcana.
    And then we stuffed them again, all 500+ bags, when we found an entire extra pallete
    of goodies we had missed.\r\n\r\nLots of free swag. You'll enjoy most of it.\r\n\r\nPeople
    are arriving every minute now, and you're bound to run into somebody in the lobby
    if you hang around enough."

    busting their butts to make sure that things flow as seamlessly as possible. I
    can't name everyone, but certainly Kent Lew and Michelle Hill deserve a round
    of applause for the hard work they've been doing in directing the various students
    and type refugees in making Typecon2007 the best ever!\r\n\r\n\r\nQuote(s) of
    day 1:\r\nJeff Barlow of AIGA Seattle: \r\n<strong>\"We're volunteers; we don't
    have names.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n<strong>\"Is there anyone at the table
    as smart as me?\"</strong>\r\n\r\nQuote of day 2:\r\nOtmar Hoefer, Director of
    Font Marketing at Linotype Library:\r\nRegarding Helvetica set as text copy: \r\n<strong>\"You
    can read it if you want to.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nI won't be there for most of day
