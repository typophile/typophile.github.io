  font, so far ive figured its Futura, but it seems the lowercase g has been changed
  any ideas, its kind of urgent since its for a pitch and I dont have access atm to
  a bigger version than those found in webpages. "

    for sale.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/catalog/verlag/index.html\r\n\r\nMy
    first ever visit to Typophile came as a result of looking for this font. I queried
    some of my designer friends and one of them sent me a link to this site and that
    thread (linked below) that dealt with the Gugg logo. At the time it was not available
    for purchase."

  body: "Thank you, thank you, thank you...... ill post more on the project soon,
    this is for the actual guggenheim, well at least my city is competing so far for
    first Latin American guggenheim, I was invited to do the webpage but found a lot
    of image problems starting by the typography selection. The logo was rendered
    with verdana, and myriad in some cases, and then it was crucified with some arial
    for the second part. I kind of felt the Gs were too diferent, I did thought of
    neutra speccially for the New York one. Im sorry i didnt do a search in typophile.
    I googled for a while and I didnt find something relevant. Ill post mockups of
    the project on the project section soon. \r\n\r\nBTW this work is amazing the
    winning project for the building itself its amazing. Ill show pics soon. "

  body: 'Hey, something''s screwy with post times. It seems like now the time on your
    post is the last edit rather than the original post, which definitely affects
    those of us who add links in later. I know I had the original ID and then I added
    the link and then went back in and added the last paragraph, and now my time is
    much later. '

    the old Guggenheim thread from 2003. Then I saw your post and edited mine to add
    the confirming link, so it got ranked earlier\u2014higgledy-piggledy \u2026 However,
    all ID credits is yours, of course!"
