  a variation on Agenda and a few letterforms have little differences from Agenda.
  I've had it for years and used it for a client project recently, now the client
  needs to purchase a licence but I can't find any information online about it.\r\n\r\nI've
  attached an upper and lower alphabet so you can see what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HalAgenda_5497.jpg]"

  body: Sounds like a corporate customization of Agenda and I'm fairly certain you
    can't get a license to use it elsewhere. Contact [[Font Bureau]].
