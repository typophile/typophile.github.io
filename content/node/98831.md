body: "My problem, ladies and gentlemen, is self-branding.\r\n\r\nI am a designer
  / Arabic calligrapher / filmmaker / human rights activist. Since my work is very
  eclectic and it comes as an extension of my personality, I cannot decide on a way
  to represent all of these different facets in a simple, clever way:\r\n\r\n\u2022
  Sometimes when I'm wearing my filmmaker's hat, I feel that the best way to represent
  myself is to have a logotype of my name, set in [[http://idsgn.org/posts/know-your-type-futura|Futura]],
  in the vein of what Stanley Kubrick and Wes Anderson would deem optimal. Futura
  also seems to be Gaspar Noe's (a French director who is at the helm of transgressive
  cinema) typeface of choice, which makes the font a very attractive choice because
  of its breadth of use. But then again,  I feel that Futura has come to symbolize
  \"the machine\" more often than not, which is not very good for an activist.\r\n\r\n\u2022
  When I'm wearing my activist hat, I feel that my logotype should be simple and low
  profile, and should have a certain \"urgent\" and \"streets\" feel to it. I am a
  big fan of [[http://www.banksy.co.uk/|Banksy]]'s work and the whole graffiti / activist
  feel of it. I am also a big fan of Alfonso Cuaron's \"Children of Men\" film, and
  I thought that the [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCTgUq6hzUk|title of the movie
  at the beginning]] felt urgent, but maybe I am confusing the mood of the film with
  the typeface that was used for the title. I also came across [[http://myfonts-wtf.s3.amazonaws.com/94/94295534a410ec57c9fc3371a34004b6.111332.png|this
  typeface]] (there is another stencil version of it) which I liked for its strength
  and urgency, but was reminded of the Soviet constructivist posters too much to pursue
  it.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Additionally, I am a designer/Arabic calligrapher. Recently, I
  became interested in monograms, and I ended up spending all of last week researching
  [[http://books.google.com.lb/books/about/2_100_Victorian_Monograms.html?id=V35qpKUE5noC&redir_esc=y|Victorian
  monograms]] (which are very nice). But let's face it, I don't think Victorian monograms
  best represent me, especially since I am an Arabic calligrapher as well. Additionally,
  if my logo is purely done as an Arabic calligraphy piece, I would risk alienating
  non-Arabic-speaking clients and benefactors. I was hoping I could do something more
  \"East meets West\" or something like that.\r\n\r\nTherein lies the rub. Some tell
  me that I am making a big deal over this, but I seem to have a talent for branding
  people but I have no way of knowing how to brand myself. I realize that none of
  you know me to offer a way to help me out, but I guess I am looking for a an objective
  insight or conceptual approach into how I can possibly group all of these different
  facets under one umbrella without seeming too corporate or pretentious. Any ideas
  / inspiration stories?"

  body: "Hello Malik and welcome to Typophile. Indeed, self branding is one of very
    challenging tasks that a designer/artist/anyone faces. Some create an identity
    according on how they perceive themselves at a particular time in their life;
    in this case their identity might change throughout their careers as they develop
    an individual way and style of doing things \u2014 this happens gradually, as
    you get more and more commissions from clients over the years you will see some
    patters in your work/life which is particular to you and someday eventually you
    will be able connect these patters and create a \u2018final\u2019 identity which
    you and people whom you work with will associate with you. Others, bearing in
    their minds that it's futile to exhibit all of their talents with just a logo
    settle for something neutral; like picking a font that they like or feel like
    connected to and base their identity around it. You can see this done by many
    famous companies and individuals i.e. [[http://www.researchstudios.com/|Research
    Studios]], [[http://www.apple.com/|Apple]], [[http://www.pentagram.com/work/#/all/all/newest//|Pentagram]],
    [[http://wallyolins.com/|Wally Olins]], etc.\r\n\r\nYou mention that you like
    Futura, but you feel like it's too industrial. I think this has to do with the
    way you see things. If you asked me about the qualities of Futura then I'd say
    that Futura is a good choice for an activist because when I see it I associate
    it with energy and courage which I believe are good words to affiliate with the
    word activist. Of course the list could go on. However I must also mention that
    Futura has had it's time, try finding something more contemporary with the qualities
    that you are looking for.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand you mention about your origins
    and that you also do calligraphy, in this case why don't you combine two types
    of styles in one. I don't know how you identify your self so I'm just gonna say
    that you could have part of your name set in Futura and the other part in something
    which looks handmade.\r\n\r\nAll that I've written above is a long, vague hint
    of what you can do. Before you pick a name, the font and the style; if I was in
    your shoes I would collect images from magazines, movie shots, images of anything
    which are close to your heart and correspond to your lifestyle, your work, put
    them up on a wall and write down words that these images bring to your head. When
    you have the words you will be able to visualize new forms in your mind and hopefully
    come up with an image of how you want others to see you/your identity. Lastly,
    fortunately the market is full of books on self branding, a trip to the library
    or the bookshop is a good starting point \u2014 just be careful on what you pick.
    \ Good luck! "

    It is equally reasonable to assume that anyone who doesn't know how to do so <em>without

    public unsupervised. You can't blame people for not having observed you long enough

    On the other hand, looking at his stuff, it is pretty cool.\r\n\r\nMalick, here's
    an idea: if you use a font (or lettering style) that emphasizes horizontals instead
    of the traditional verticals in Latin, you would allude to Arabic, and you would
    allude to revolution, while remaining subtle and tasteful. Look at the fonts of
    Excoffon and Bloemsma for starters.\r\n\r\nYou might also consider leveraging
    Arabic's diamond motif. For example:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/97738#comment-531452\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: ">  designer / Arabic calligrapher / filmmaker / human rights activist\r\n\r\nLogos
    are best when they communicate a simple, clear message or feeling. Trying to illustrate
    all these varied activities in one logo might be difficult unless you can find
    a common idea or theme that runs through all of them.\r\n\r\nIf you can't combine
    them, one possible solution is to follow a similar approach to corporations that
    need separate logos for each division of their company. You'd create a series
    of logos that were specific to each of your occupations, but clearly related in
    style, font usage, etc.\r\n\r\n> I have no way of knowing how to brand myself.\r\n\r\nIt's

    broad brush strokes impart a heck of a lot of emotion don't they. Kinda like you
    ...no? The black Arabic text holds everything down like a keel steadies a boat.
    So, for your branding why not use these very same design elements ... one element
    of broad passionate expression steadied by your discipline(s). The broad element
    could be an interpretation of a meaningful Arabic word and the text could be non-Arabic.
    \r\n\r\n@hrant ...there can be only one :)  Sorry about confusing the matter.
    I found that after I raed and viewed the interwebs entire content it was difficult
