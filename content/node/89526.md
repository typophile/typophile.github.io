    > Any info available about that project?\r\nDid you read that in an older post?
    I designed a PDF at one point but later went back to Microsoft Word to gather
    more information and then make a consistent layout for the information to publish
    as a PDF and potentially a book. In the end though I felt like there was no real
    purpose to it other than the wonderful process of having educating myself in the
    different type classifications and general type principles. I still have the documents
    if you like them, but it's incomplete and in regard of my grown experience and
    knowledge quite outdated as well. Perhaps one day I will use the information to
    write a proper book about something more specific and substantial. For example,
    I'm a big fan of Gerrit Noordzij's \"The Stroke\". Something like that gives a
    much better insight in typefaces and type design than a compilation of subjectively
    \"good\" typefaces."
