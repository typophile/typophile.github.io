  share what I had found. So I created villatype, a visual record and discussion of
  typography in the public domain. If you are interested in submitting your own found
  type please feel free to contact me. Visit villatype at villatype.blogspot.com\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/villatype_3553.gif]"
