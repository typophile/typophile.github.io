<p>Some have held up well while others have turned brittle yellow brown. Oddly enough, Volume 1, No. 1 is still brighter than 80% of my collection. It&rsquo;s obvious that some were printed on a text stock a few notches above the more common newsprint.</p>
<p>As time permits, I plan to write something about the U&amp;lc Phenomenon.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m old, but I ain&rsquo;t brittle yet!</p>

<p>Back in 1998 this was the plan (sort of). A note posted on my &lsquo;blog&rsquo; from that era&hellip;</p>
<p>U&amp;lc cleared for take off
New York, NY. - 23 September 1998
When ITC changed the format of the popular printed quarterly, company head Mark Batty stated that the Web version would be extended. U&amp;lc editor John D. Berry and his team have followed through on that promise with articles that appear exclusively in the online version. By the time U&amp;lc vol.25 no.2 hits the newsstands the online version will include online columns by Eileen Gunn, Olav Martin Kvern, and a mystery columnist. Expect new content to be posted on the U&amp;lc site by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Ilene Strizver and Allan Haley are frequent contributors, and both remain dedicated educators and lovers of the craft.</p>
<p>I believe what you are missing is the old irreverant playfulness inspired by Herb Lubalin. It wasn&rsquo;t quite the &ldquo;Monty Python&rdquo; of publications, but certainly more of the &ldquo;Smothers Brothers&rdquo; presentation of quality content behind the jokes and wisecracks.</p>
<p>Whatever I do will be more about the U&amp;lc phenomenon that had thousands of readers tackling mailmen for their quarterly issue. Also, a little bit about the affect it had on raising anti-piracy issues, licensing and royalties, inspired marketing techniques and what happens when you allow designers to have fun doing what they love.</p>
<p>More than likely it will start out as an expanded typowiki. Also, I have no authority to reuse or display copyrighted material, so I doubt that it would grow into an online archive.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As I see it, U&amp;lc cannot translate properly onto the web because part of the experience of U&amp;lc was seeing the printed page and how the letters interacted with that set page size. The web is limited in that way because if you want to look closely at a letter you zoom in and lose the surrounding area. However, with print you have the information in your peripheral vision still. I know this might sound wacky, but I have noticed that it is still more visually exciting to view things such as U&amp;lc as they were intended to be viewed &ndash; in all of their printed glory.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tiffany, you are absolutely correct!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started writing two articles on the U&amp;lc Phenomenon; one as a review of the new <em>U&amp;lc</em> book for Stephen Coles, and the other focusing on the impact ITC and <em>U&amp;lc</em> had on the world of type.</p>
<p>In writing my drafts, I&rsquo;ve described several factors that made U&amp;lc such a unique publication and experience. In one, the very fact that the early editions were printed in black &amp; white on newsprint, meant that layouts, type selections, illustrations and typography were presented in raw unadulterated print, with no reliance on stock, ink colors or higher lpi (lines per inch) halftones.</p>
<p>So there you had it, the most dynamic typographic layouts printed on cheezy newspaper offset. And that&rsquo;s how it was meant to be experienced, in it&rsquo;s purest form, like the actual da Vinci notebooks, or tablecloth drawings of Toulouse-Lautrec. The majority of the world can only see repros or facsimiles of the above, which lacks the very tactile quality of the originals. The experience is absolutely different.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know. Don&rsquo;t compare one-of-a-kind masterpieces with a magazine that had runs in the thousands. I said it was a draft, didn&rsquo;t I?</p>
