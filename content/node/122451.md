body: Does anyone know if there is a digitized group of Serif Gothic alternate characters?
  I've never found this, & I know as of now there is no "official" version, but I
  am wondering if anyone has one that they may have made themselves. Thx much.

  body: I have never seen one on the web but back in 2006 when I needed them I did
    a quick and dirty traced scan version - do not have it any more but it only had
    eight or ten additional alt characters as I remember.
