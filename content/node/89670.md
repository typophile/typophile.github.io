  by typing is super difficult for me. If you want me to reply to something please
  give me a call.\r\n1.786.234.9582\r\nIf you do not need a reply you can post on
  this site or at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2112689177/man-greater-than-money?ref=email\r\n\r\nSome
  of you will love this font and some of you will hate it.\r\n\r\nThe Man Greater
  Than Money Font blatantly ignores traditional notions of typography to achieve harmonious
  word shapes without awkward negative spaces or strokes. The letters are not really
  letters but instead highly legible geometric forms so that these shapes can function
  as visual elements within the layout.\r\n\r\nI commenced working on this font 17
  years ago and created it to be used exclusively in secondary display settings; especially
  for magazine layouts because I do so many. \r\n\r\nDue to space limitations, the
  full \u201CMan Greater Than Money\u201D font can\u2019t be shown.  The Man Greater
  Than Money Font contains: Basics, Alternates, Display figure (not shown to conserve
  space), Universal Accents, Tabular figures (not shown to conserve space), Diacritics,
  Flips, Cyrillics (not shown to conserve space), Diphthongs (not shown to conserve
  space) and  Akhand Ligatures (not shown to conserve space). Yes, that's tens of
  thousands of Alternate glyphs in a single font that does not even have any minuscules.\r\n\r\nYou
  can see the font here\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2112689177/man-greater-than-money?ref=email\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
  help me get the word out on this font.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nAlfonso\r\nMan Greater
  Than Money"

    spelling of a word as I look at it."

  body: "Copy and pasted from the Kickstarter post.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I provide
    two dollars when I can just wait and eventually I can get the Man Greater Than
    Money Font for free?\"\r\n\r\n\"First off, if you really cannot afford two dollars
    for a font, just send me an email and I will let you know when it is available
    to the public and were you can get it for free.\"\r\n\r\n\"I, however, understand
    the point you are making: that despite what an incredible value the Man Greater
    Than Money Font is at a meager $2.00, by ultimately offering it free of any charge,
    I am creating a disincentive towards baking the project. For that reason I shale
    release the font in the fallowing manner: If the project raises $1 then all the
    Basics will be released with the font but only the basics. $6,000 and all the
    Alternates are also released. $12,000 and all the Display figures (not shown to
    conserve space) are also released. $24,000 and all the Universal Accents are also
    released. $40,000 and all the Tabular figures (not shown to conserve space) are
    also released. $75,000 and all the Diacritics are also released. $125,000 and
    all the Flips are also released. $175,000 and all the Cyrillics (not shown to
    conserve space) are also released. $225,000 and all the Diphthongs (not shown
    to conserve space) are also released. $250,000 and all the Akhand Ligatures (not
    shown to conserve space) are also released.\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words the font
    will be released no matter what, how extensive the font will be right from the
    start is completely dependent on you. Any portion of the font that is not immediately
    released will be; just at a later time; perhaps by anther Kick Starter project
    but that is yet to be determined. I do not care to contemplate failure right now.\"\r\n\r\nAs
    of this writing the project has raised a whapping $28.00 and even if it does not
    raise a penny more I am still obligated to release for free at least the basics.
    Here is a secret I will most likely release more than the basics even if I do
    not raise any were near $6,000. The reason for this is that I did not create this
    project to raise money but as I stated at the very top of the Kickstarter post.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
    most important thing to know is that this project was created to build appreciation
    and a network of goodwill so when I announce my forth coming revolutionary project
    I can have an audience to communicated to directly. Because of my disabilities,
    I currently have no online network and yes, I fully recognize that a font is the
    type of idiosyncratic project that less than one percent of the population cares
    about. However, the next project will have incredible mass appeal, enact substantive
    societal good and may even profoundly impact an industry. Really, the next project
    will be Steve Jobs kind of big. So even if you don't care to donate a cent to
    this project please send me an email or better yet give me call so that when I
    announce the massive project I can inform you about it directly.\u201D\r\n\r\nSuccess
    will be based on the amount of people I reach not the money raised. I want to
    release the full font. It is already done but I need to provide an incentive for
    people to promote the project.\r\n\r\nI am thinking that if 100 people contact
    me by Kickstarter, even if no one else contributes any money, I will add the Alternates
    to the release.\r\n\r\nIf 200 people contact me will also add the Display figure
    to the release.\r\nIf 300 people contact me will also add the Universal Accents
    to the release.\r\nIf 400 people contact me will also add the Tabular figures
    to the release.\r\nIf 500 people contact me will also add the Diacritics to the
    release.\r\nIf 600 people contact me will also add the Flips to the release.\r\nIf
    700 people contact me will also add the Cyrillics to the release.\r\nIf 800 people
    contact me will also add the Diphthongs to the release.\r\nIf 900 people contact
    me will also add the Akhand Ligatures to the release.\r\n\r\nDo you folks think
    this is a good promotion idea?\r\n\r\nPlease blog, e-mail, text or twitter about
    this project. \r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nAlfonso\r\nmangreaterthanmoney@gmail.com\r\n1.786.234.9582\r\nMan

    routinely publish articles by type designers. I understand that writing is not
    your forte, but maybe if you recorded a short video or audio clip about the font,
    along with some visuals, they would be happy to publish it as a guest post.
