    body: I agree with Don there, what did you use to find the font cause im also
      receiving Coronet for font. Try using Identifont, Adobe and WhatTheFont.com.
      they are free and do pretty great when you cant figure something out.

  body: "What did I use to find the font?\r\n1. Memory. This is an old familiar face.\r\n2.
    For old scripts, it's quicker to check if my memory about the font name is correct
    by a quick flip through the script pages of Jaspert's _Encylopedia of Typefaces_[1970],
    than to chug through images online.\r\nDon\r\n"
