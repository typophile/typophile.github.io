  at type design, and my eyes are already weakening so I've decided to ask here. Please
  butcher what I have:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Correla-Metrics-1_5442.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.
  It has a bit of contrast, I've tried making this have almost no contrast, but I
  didn't quite like it. Still struggling my way with the contrast for the figures,
  where to put the weight and how to balance it, etc."

  body: "I like the idea, but I think the tail of the \"y\" is a little too short.\r\nAlso
    the a curve (at top) is a bit too \"open\" and you could try to make the K and
    k merged instead of a horizontal line between the two parts.\r\nI think you'd
    better use dots or (unrotated) squares instead of the shapes you now have as points.\r\n\r\nKeep
    up the good work! ;)\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nMartijn van Berkel"

  body: "Thank you all for the feedback! Summer semester has started, so once again
    I have no time to update this as much as I would want to.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll
    critique myself:\r\n1. vxy thin, add a little width to w\r\n2. top of K looks
    too heavy\r\n3. what's up with S?\r\n4. UVW too narrow?\r\n5. widths are not consistent,
    some look a bit heavy than the others. for example, B, w, x, etc\r\n6. make this
    monolinear, I don't think the width differences work on this. I don't know.\r\n7.
    g looks weak, as is j and a\r\n8. proportions are really off\r\n"

    a heavy middle that seems to have sunk to the baseline. \r\nB and S are funny
    shapes.\r\nEye of e is too small?\r\nI don't think the Kk with crossbar is a problem.\r\np
    and d are not good curves.\r\nu maybe too wide.\r\nProportions of numerals are
    off. Bottom half should be bigger. Question mark should flow rather than the corner?\r\n\r\nI
    think you can definitely get a worthwhile font out of this, just need to make
    the shapes harmonise better :)"

  body: "Now that I haven't looked at this thing for two weeks, I can see that B is
    weird in relation to the rest. Thank you Ben for the feedback. It's true that
    p and d are really off, due to the sharp curves that form from the stem. I seem
    to have trouble making them smoother like b and q with the x-height and width.
    And yes, the numerals are way, way off.\r\n\r\nI'll post a pdf when I update this
    over next week's weekend; I'll probably redraw this from scratch to reconsider
    things."
