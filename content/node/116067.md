body: "Hello, I'm looking for a highly legible font for use in body copy, cutlines,
  and possibly heads and sub heads for a children's magazine (ages 9-13). \r\nI need
  a contemporary and friendly look . Must be easy to read, and have some character
  \ while being the neutral font to some animated display fonts.\r\nThe magazine content
  is science-oriented and educational, packaged in a cool, entertaining way. \r\nDefinitely
  not stereotypical (no Clarendon, or New Century Schoolbook as much as I like them).
  Because the magazine includes both genders, and softer, human content, I don't want
  a cold. science-y looking font.\r\nPreferably one story \"a\" and \"g.\" I'm leaning
  towards slab serif or humanist. Bree is one of my selections, but have some concern
  about the legibility with its slight condensed look.  I'm pairing it with a sans,
  currently looking at Tenso, which has some character and flexibility.\r\nAll suggestions
  welcome!\r\n\r\nI also welcome any info on selecting readable fonts for kids (who
  are reading less than previous generations), specifically font test research or
  any kind of concretes to provide guidance on typography for kids. (Does text really
  need to be broken into small blocks? I don't think so, but research would help substantiate.)\r\nThanks
  for reading this!\r\n"

    really does sound like a particularly good fit in this case:\r\nhttp://ernestinefont.com/\r\nFF
    Ernestine has won multiple awards for good reason, and it works exceptionally
    well onscreen too.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I don\u2019t think you should overtly telegraph that you\u2019re targeting
    children by using \u201Cearly reading\u201D single bowl /a and /g. Nobody likes
    to be dumbed down to, certainly not 9\u201313 year olds. I would add that double
    bowl /a and /g add sophistication that children that age might \uFB01nd attractive,
    and for legibility and readability these forms are far preferable, the two-storey
    /a in particular disambiguating from /o.\r\n\r\nI like your idea of using a slab,
    it is unfussy and has a clarity suitable to the subject matter.\r\n\r\nTherefore
    I would recommend my Bodoni Egyptian. It is not overtly cute or trendy; neither
    is it a traditional, old-fashioned geometric slab serif, but a new idea of applying
    a monoline treatment to a classic style.\r\n\r\nAnd, with its small x-height,
    it does not create an intimidating text mass at Regular weight, as the larger
    x-height slab serifs do.\r\n\r\nThe Bodoni Egyptian also has a large selection
    of weights (the Thin and Extra Light are quite interesting at display sizes),
    and all the bells and whistles such as small caps, alternate \uFB01gure styles,
    and compound fractions\u2014good for scienti\uFB01c material.\r\n\r\nhttp://origin.myfonts.net/s/aw/original/99/0/51097.pdf\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think FF Ernestine is a good choice - is very readable but also has a nice
    light vibe - Bodoni Egyptian is a nice face but is "heavy" in feel.
