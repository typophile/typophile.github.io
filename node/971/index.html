  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">indesign users: y&#39;all remember how easy it was to make global changes to kern pairs in qxp -- i&#39;ve spoken w adobe reps &amp; they assure me that indesign will NOT have this feature in any future revs. this means that altering kern pairs has to be done at the font level, thus: <BR>1. leave indesign app <BR>2. turn off font in suitcase or other font manager <BR>3. open font in font editor <BR>4. make change&#40;s&#41; to font&#39;s kern pairs <BR>5. turn font back on in font manager <BR>6. return to indesign &amp; get back to work. <BR> <BR>am i missing something? can anyone offer a better method? this seems way too time-consuming and troublesome. <BR>HELP! <BR> <BR>thanks much, folks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">maybe it could be done by a plug-in? <BR>perhaps someone could contact any  <BR>plug-in-programmer. <BR> <BR>I think, it would be a useful feature - not  <BR>necessarily for normal Text, optical kerning is  <BR>very good, but for logo-fonts or special  <BR>characters/pi-combinations. <BR>In a 500-page-book created with Corel Ventura I  <BR>used it for better kerning of numbers.  <BR>In InDesign it would be necessary to use optical  <BR>kerning for all the text to improve inline  <BR>numbers. <BR> <BR></div>

I can&#39;t comment on specific features of unannounced products, and I&#39;m not saying it will be in the next major version, but to say that &#34;it will positively definitely not be forthcoming in any InDesign releases&#34; is vastly overstating the case.
