body: "Hello there Typophile, \r\n\r\nI have a new kickstarter project, a work-in-progress
  children's book to educate about typographic forms. You can see a bit more about
  the project which includes, like Chatype, a custom typeface. I'd imagine this is
  right up most Typophile's alley.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/insigne/the-clothes-letters-wear\r\n\r\nI'd
  love to have you assistance in making this book a reality. I'm happy to answer any
  questions as well, as I am sure there will be many about Cabrito.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nJeremy
  Dooley"
