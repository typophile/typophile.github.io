body: "Hey guys, I thought your collective expertise might help me on this:\r\nI'm
  trying to implement an experimental writing system as an opentype font. It uses
  devanagari-style glyph combination, that is:\r\n\r\n  consonant + vowel -> 'cv'
  ligature\r\nbut ALSO\r\n  vowel + vowel -> 'vv' lig\r\nAND\r\n  'cv' lig + vowel
  -> 'cvv'\r\n\r\nand there are some fina features for good measure.\r\n\r\n23 consonants
  and 6 vowels obviously makes hundreds of glyphs. I realise I can sub them ALL but
  I would rather find an elegant way of programming them. So I have a few questions:\r\n\r\n1)\r\nIn
  fontlab, I can do \"sub cons vowel by combi\", and \"sub @consonant by @combined\",
  but sub won't take a class as the out stream on a context substitution, like \"sub
  @cons a by @acons\". Is there a way around this? (my glyphs are named appropriately
  (by fontlab standards) if this were to theoretically be possible)\r\n\r\n2)\r\nFont
  doesnt support multisubstitutions; if I were to use software like VOLT which does,
  would it accept a class as an out stream in a contextual sub, like the functionality
  I desire which I described above?\r\n\r\n3)\r\nI have tried to experiment using
  VOLT, but when I load in my .ttf, my meticulously named glyphs are reset to 'glyph001',
  'glyph002' etc, which makes them impractical to me to create classes with, because
  there's HUNDREDS and I dont want to name them all a second time. Is there option
  in either fontlab or VOLT I am missing. It would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,
  please respond if you can, even if it's just to tell me I have to sub them all one
  by one... :)\r\n\r\nLak\r\n\r\n"
