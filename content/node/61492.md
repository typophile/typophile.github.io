body: "Can anyone recommend a shop that makes plates for photopolymer letterpress
  in Europe (the closer to Switzerland the better)? The two shops I keep reading about
  are both in the US. There must be something like that on this side of the Pond too,
  right? \r\nIf possible (and if I get to be picky), I'd likely prefer a place that
  makes the plates and also offers the printing itself, to reduce overhead / shipping
  costs / time.\r\nThanks for any pointers!"

    f\xFCr Flexo- und Buchdruck\" \u2013 \"Flexodruck\" would be the one I want, right?
    (I've only really heard about photopolymer letterpress in English, so I'm actually
    not sure what the proper German term is.)\r\n\r\nPS. Good luck next week-end!"

    Printing forms for flexo are commonly distorted along one axis to compensate for
