    but there are some uni...'s in amongst the afii...'s to complicate matters.\r\n\r\nSo,
    I haven't really helped. Sorry.\r\n\r\n(Linotype appear to use uni... Microsoft
    afii...)"

  body: "<em>The default on FontLab is afii...</em>\r\n\r\nI am surprised. In the
    header of the file standard.nam that I downloaded from [[http://forum.fontlab.com/announcements-from-the-forum\u2019s-moderators/beta-versions-of-2009-glyphnametounicode-tables-for-fl-studio-and-typetool-t7078.0.html;msg23981#msg23981|this
    old link]] I read\r\n<code>\r\n%%FONTLAB NAMETABLE: 2009 Recommended (no afiiXXXXX,
    no double-encoding)\r\n% FontLab DEFAULT nametable recommended for all new fonts\r\n</code>"

  body: "\"afii\" is the old convention. The newest standard.nam (part of Fontographer
    5) no longer uses it. We recommend using \"uni\", and so does Adobe. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft
    uses \"afii\" in their old fonts. New fonts (Cambria, Constantia etc.) use no
    glyph names at all. "

  body: "Acrobat, the only application that still has a significant need to parse
    glyph names under some circumstances recognises both the uni and afii names for
    Cyrillic. afii is obsolete though, and uni makes more sense.\r\n\r\nAdam, Microsoft's
    policy on glyph naming varies: some fonts have format 3 post tables with no glyph
    names, some have uni format and/or AGL glyph names, and some have non-parseable
    glyph names. I always try to provide them with uni format names unless they've
    already told me that they intend to use a format 3 post table for the font or
    the layout behaviour is such that a direct route from glyph name to character
    code isn't possible, e.g. an Indic font with a glyph that represents non-contiguous
    character codes."

  body: "BTW, currently the best way to get the most current standard.nam and encoding
    files is to download and install the Fontographer 5 demo version (unless of course
    you buy the full license for Fontographer). Fontographer 5 and FontLab Studio
    5 use the same files in a shared location, and Fontographer 5 brings the most
    current versions. \r\n\r\nI realize this is not optimal, but for the time being,
    that's the way it is. It should change in a few months, though :)"

    to the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/html/readmes/MinionProReadMe.html\">Minion
    Pro ReadMe</a> file, version 2.030 created 2007/08/16 already had names beginning
    with uni; and I cite: <cite>Cyrillic glyphs which had names beginning with \"afii\"
    now have names beginning with \"uni\", conveying their Unicode value.</cite>"
