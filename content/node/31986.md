body: "Cyrillic Weekend, with [[Maxim Zhukov]] as the instructor-moderator\r\n\r\nFor
  those of you with an interest in multi-script typeface design who could not attend
  the [[Type Directors Club|TDC]] program last weekend, you missed a fantastic opportunity.
  Maxim was at his finest presenting the nuances of [[Cyrillic]] type and helping
  the 18 who attended improve their own works in progress. The event started with
  a trip to the New York Public Library special collection of rare early books printed
  in Cyrillic. I\u2019ll bet it was tough having the Czar as your art director\u2014we
  got to see handwritten notes of instruction and critiques in the Czar\u2019s own
  hand and some spectacular books. \r\nAfter a day of Maxim\u2019s presentations on
  Cyrillic forms and styles, there were critiques of numerous impressive works in
  progress by the participants. \r\n[[James Montalbano]], [[Gary Munch]], and [[Carol
  Wahler]] put the event together helping Maxim bring it to life. Hats off to them
  all for making it a valuable learning experience and an enjoyable weekend as well!\r\n\r\nThe
  TDC will also bring [[Gerry Leonidas]] back in the Fall to present Greek Weekend,
  the second in the non-Latin the series.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tdc.org/events/education//non-latinweek-ends/2007nonlatleonidasgreek.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tdc.org/events/education/non-latinweek-ends/2007nonlatzhukovcyrillic.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tdc.org/\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    and glyphs, which is central to the OpenType premise, should be absolutely rigid.
    If not, the absurd situation arises - as with the Bulgarian and Serbian alternates

    With the keyboard you insert character codepoints, not glyph IDs. So the underlying
    text data for Russian, Bulgarian and Serbian is the same, the only difference
    is the glyph form.\r\n\r\nTo answer Nick, Chris is right; to implement these glyph-form
    differences in an OpenType font you'll have to use the 'locl' feature. Here's
    a code snippet that handles the lowercase 'be' (\u0431 U+0431 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER
    BE):\r\n\r\n<code>feature locl {\r\n\r\n\tscript cyrl;\r\n\t\tlanguage SRB exclude_dflt;
    # Serbian\r\n\t\t\tsub be by be.serb;\r\n\r\n} locl;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/be_beserb_3714.png]\r\n'be'
    and 'be.serb'\r\n\r\nThe above assumes that the default form of 'be' is the one
    used for Russian (i.e. the default representation of the character U+0431 is the
    6-like shape).\r\nIf, for example, the main market for your font was Serbia, then
    you could (hypothetically) revert the order and make the Serbian form the default
    one. But this would complicate the feature code, because you would then have to
    specify all the other languages that use Cyrillic and which prefer the 6-like
    shape. Here's what I mean:\r\n\r\n<code>feature locl {\r\n\r\n\tscript cyrl;\r\n\t\tlanguage
    RUS exclude_dflt; # Russian\r\n\t\t\tlookup BE_SIX_LIKE_SHAPE {\r\n\t\t\t\tsub
    be by be.russ;\r\n\t\t\t\t# Notice the difference in this substitution.\r\n\t\t\t\t#
    Also, glyph 'be.serb' was renamed to 'be', and 'be.russ' was 'be'.\r\n\t\t\t}
    BE_SIX_LIKE_SHAPE;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tlanguage UKR exclude_dflt; # Ukrainian\r\n\t\t\tlookup
    BE_SIX_LIKE_SHAPE;\r\n\r\n\t\tlanguage UZB exclude_dflt; # Uzbek\r\n\t\t\tlookup
    BE_SIX_LIKE_SHAPE;\r\n\r\n\t\tlanguage MKD exclude_dflt; # Macedonian\r\n\t\t\tlookup
    BE_SIX_LIKE_SHAPE;\r\n\r\n\t\tlanguage BEL exclude_dflt; # Belarussian\r\n\t\t\tlookup
    BE_SIX_LIKE_SHAPE;\r\n\r\n\t\t# And so on...\r\n} locl;\r\n</code>\r\n"

  body: "<em>Greek has a tonos.</em>\r\n\r\nWell it does and it doesn't. The Greek
    diacritic letters with tonos and oxia both decompose to letter plus U+0301, which
    is the combining acute accent character. This means that bi-script fonts supporting
    combining mark characters need to have a Greek-specific (<locl> feature) glyph
    for U+0301 and other general diacritics.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in a combined Latin-Cyrillic
    font with combining mark support one would want a Cyrillic-specific 'breve' glyph.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    the form of these characters as used in different scripts may vary, they are clearly
    the same character performing the same orthographic functions. The Greek tonos
    performs the same stress mark role as the acute in most European orthographies;
    the Greek oxia and varia were tone marks and correspond to the use of acute and
    grave in the orthographies of huge numbers of tonal languages in Africa and elsewhere;
    the Cyrillic kratka, like the Latin (and Greek) breve, indicates a short vowel
    sound."

  body: "<em>the kratka is not considered a diacritic, but is actually part of the
    letter</em>\r\n\r\nThis is an intra-orthographic observation, i.e. in the writing
    of Russian the kratka is considered part of the letter and the most obvious evidence
    of this is that the long i vowel and the short i vowel (with kratka) are sorted
    separately in dictionaries. But one shouldn't presume that the kratka will always
    be considered 'part of the letter' in all orthographies. It is a mark that indicates
    a short vowel sound, and hence could easily be adapted as a combining diacritic
    in orthographies for other languages.\r\n\r\nAs a parallel, think of the Latin
    \xE1. In French, this is considered a letter plus diacritic mark, and is sorted
    in dictionaries amid the letter A words. In Northern Sami, \xE1 is considered
    a separate letter and is sorted after A."

    \r\n\r\n1. Kofi Annan used to say about some political developments, \"It\u2019s
    not an event, it\u2019s a process.\" Maxim referred to this quotation on several
    occasions. \r\n\r\n2. While Maxim Zhukov worked as typographic coordinator at
    the United Nations in New York, his immediate boss at the UN was also Russian.
    At one time, When Maxim prepared a publication, something has gone wrong. His
    boss looked at him and asked: \"Maxim Georgevich, is this a screw-up, or is this
    a position?\" Maxim admitted that it was a screw-up. \r\n\r\nWhen <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/adamt/410712188/in/set-72157594570229703/\">Gary
    Munch</a> said \"shnorkel\", I interpreted that he meant the German \"Schn\xF6rkel\"
    (an embellishment, squiggle, flourish) rather than \"Schnorchel\"/snorkel. But
    I think it may have been just a merging of both terms. \r\n\r\nGary has reasonable
    knowledge of German but his rendition of Schn\xF6rkel sounded more \"New York
    jiddish\" than actual German. James Montalbano instantly liked the term, so did
    I. I think it should find its way into general typographic terminology. \r\n\r\nOverall,
    I must compliment Maxim on his teaching skills. I was very impressed with the
    Cyrillic workshopm and thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though I do have good knowledge
    of Cyrillic, I did learn a lot. I found the formula very well chosen: \r\n\r\n*
    Friday afternoon was a visit to the Slavic division of the New York Public Library,
    where we could look at some old Cyrillic type specimens and prints (though some
    participants, including myself, wished that we could spend more time looking at
    the specimens). \r\n\r\n* Saturday was a full-day (9 to 5) lecture-style, when
    Maxim first talked about the development of the Cyrillic script (the pre-Petrine
    time, the reform by Peter the Great, the 19th century type founding, the Soviet
    period and the newest times), and then discussed the entire alphabet <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/adamt/410708645/in/set-72157594570229703/\">letter-by-letter</a>
    (the Russian as well as some non-Russian letters): first uppercase, then upright
    lowercase, and finally italic lowercase. He also discussed the peculiarities of
    handwritten and script Cyrillic. \r\n\r\n* Sunday was another full day, during
    which Maxim critiqued the Cyrillic type designs that the participants sent him
    before the workshop, all produced according to a standardized layout. For the
    first 3 or so participants, he spent some 30-40 minutes talking about each project.
    All the time, he actively asked for comments from other participants, and it was
    a collaborative critique rather than a one-way monologue. We spent a bit less
    time for each of the designs discussed later, but it was not a problem because
    the discussion about the first three or so designs already covered many common
    problems that appeared in designs that appeared later, so we didn\u2019t actually
    feel that we needed to talk in great detail about every single alphabet. So in
    the discussion on the later designs, Maxim concentrated on the specific issues
    not discussed previously. \r\n\r\nThe visuals presented by Maxim were very good
    and comprehensive. He also presented a collection of books that people could find
    useful when studying Cyrillic (many of them were in Russian only). \r\n\r\nI found
    Maxim\u2019s timing perfect: he finished 4:58 on Saturday, and 4:45 on Sunday,
    just on time. The balance between serious content and lightweight anecdotes was
    just right. It was both <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/adamt/410714979/in/set-72157594570229703/\">informative</a>
    and <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/adamt/410716190/in/set-72157594570229703/\">fun</a>.
    \r\n\r\nEven though the event was not the cheapest for me (flight from Berlin
    to New York, hotel and the participation fee), I felt that my money was extremely
    well spent. Even though I had known Maxim for seven or so years now, worked with
    him on several ATypI projects, and spoke to him during various conferences, it
    was the first time that I could enjoy his knowledge and experience for a longer
    period of time, several days. This was far better than the brief conversations
    we had previously. Thank you, Maxim! \r\n\r\nI\u2019d also like to thank <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/adamt/410731168/in/set-72157594570229703/\">the
    other participants</a>. I felt it was an excellent group, very active and responsive,
    and it was fun seeing some of my good friends again, and taking part in it. \r\n\r\nAdam"
