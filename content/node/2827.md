  appears to be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/gable-antique-condensed-sg/">Gable
  Antique Condensed SG</a>. Evidently that digital font is based on original designs
  from the Bauer Type Foundry. My questions are: How long was this font of metal type
  manufactured? Who made it besides the Bauer Type Foundry? Is more of this metal
  type available from some source?'
