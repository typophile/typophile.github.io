body: What makes a letter a that letter? How far can you bend it before it's no longer
  recognizable? I know it's a basic question of type design, since there are only
  so many ways to draw an "a" or any other letter. (or are there?) I've wondered how
  it works not only for Roman letters, but for Greek, Cyrillic and Chinese.

    letters they're not."

  body: "Brad, this fascinating and central question is not\r\nreally answerable,
    at least not yet, not empirically.\r\n\r\nBut one thing I did during the first
    TypeCon in\r\n'98 was give a talk about my Trajic notRoman font:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trajic.html
    _\r\nDuring the talk I flashed images of the glyphs and\r\nasked for quick letter
    identification. Very informal\r\nand not rigorous at all, but the results -as
    well as the\r\nprocess- I think were interesting to the audience.\r\nThey were
    certainly interesting to me!\r\n\r\nOne other thing: Alfred Kallir has surmised
    that each\r\nletter has \"acrocratic\" features, which give it its being.\r\nPresumably
    these are what can be bent the least.\r\n\r\nOur Peter Enneson knows a lot about
    this stuff - do ask for his insights.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: What complicates this is that context plays a large part in a letter's identity.
    So if you play with the shape of an 'A' in isolation, you're nowhere near testing
    the limits of what can read as an 'A'. The exact same shape can be clearly one
    letter in one typeface and clearly a different letter in another.

  body: "Is the font meant to be read, or just to \"look different.\" I am reminded
    of those old Fillmore West posters of the 60s, with the \"groovy\" lettering.
    There is no problem reading these. First you take a hit of LSD, and then wait
    until the poster becomes readable. (Of course, without the LSD, the things are
    impossible to decipher.)\r\n\r\n> How far can you bend it before it's no longer
    recognizable?\r\n\r\nExactly that far, and not a bit more. In fact, you are probably
    smart to back off a good chunk from where it is no longer recognizable to you.
    The artist often has a different vision of his creation than a casual viewer.
    As in:\r\n\r\n\"Why Billy, that's a great picture of a cow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Daddy,
    don't be silly. It's a picture of Mommy.\""
