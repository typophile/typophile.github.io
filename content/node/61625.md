body: "dear typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm going to study at the Reading MATD in a few weeks
  and started my first warmup research-exercise:\r\n\r\nI stated this exercise with
  a quesion of mixing one-storied and two-storied g's and a's in one font and how
  this decision can affect the delivered impression. What are the reasons and arguments
  to decide which forms to use and what kinds of problems would you associate with
  this question? In which context does one form make sense and in what context the
  other?\r\n<!--break-->\r\nI know my question is quite general in the moment but
  nevertheless I would appreciate any hint concerning:\r\n\r\n> examples of typefaces
  which provide alternatives (both styles)\r\n> historical background about the one-
  and two-storied forms\r\n> any rules or conventions in which one style should be
  used\r\n> connotations/denotations for the single characters\r\n> ...advices which
  I'm not able to think of by now\r\n\r\nthanks a lot!\r\nnicole\r\n\r\nPS are there
  any serif-fonts with one-storied a or g? Or fonts with double-storied a but one-storied
  g (which is more unusual than the opposite)?\r\n"

  body: Plantin Schoolbook (actually most Schoolbook of any font variants) have a
    one story 'a' and 'g'. Plantin Schoolbook was sort of brought to attention by
    Wallpaper Magazine, btw. Both Capsa by Dino dos Santos and Galaxie Copernicus
    by Kris Sowersby (both based on Plantin) also do. Many Neo Grotesques have a one
    story 'g' and a two story 'a', amongst others Helvetica.

    variants for both a and g.\r\n\r\n<a href = \"http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts\">Thesis</a>
    has both options for the g.\r\n\r\nLook at Frutiger's designs for further one-storey
    serif g's."
