  suggested:\r\n\u062D\u0631\u0641 \u0645\u0637\u0628\u0639\u064A1\r\n\u062E\u0637

  1 because \u062D\u0631\u0641 is an individual letter as an independent unit, while
  \u062E\u0637 suggests a script. Which do you prefer?  What other technical terms
  related to typography have multiple Arabic names or are not yet properly defined?
  For example light, bold, condensed etc.  You are invited to discuss these matters
  here, or to post your lists of suggested Arabic typography terms."

    (typographic script) is an accurate term for \"typeface\", since it describes
    the result, just like typeface does.\r\n\r\nThe term bunt\u0323 [bunt] \u0628\u064F\u0646\u0652\u0637\u0652,
    on the other hand, is an accurate description of \"font\", since it refers to
    an aspect of typographic craftmanschip. \"Font\" is a corruption of the older
    \"fount\". the result of founding molten lead. Bunt\u0323 \u0628\u064F\u0646\u0652\u0637\u0652
    can hardly be Arabic or even Semitic (although the absense of an etymological
    dictionary of Arabic remains embarassing), as can be inferred by the absence of
    any other derivations of the BNT root within Arabic, as well as the complete absence
    of the BNT root anywhere else in Semitic languages. Rather, it appears to be the
    word \"point\", \"punkt\". \"punto\"  or even \"punt\" as a European term of size
    in typography.\r\n \r\nPS - this web site should support Unicode! My Arabic transcription

    and I can pluralize it easily. I agree with Tom's and Vladimir's explanations
    that \u0628\u0646\u0637 must have been derived from \"point\" as in point size.
    \ But this should not matter as even in Latin the popular word \"font\" used today
    was only referring to a specific point size of a type before taking over in the
    terms type or typeface after computers, and therefore it is not an accurate term
    in its current usage. Arguments constantly flare about it and other terms.\r\n\r\nOne
    can argue, if we can Arabize \"point\" for font, why not Arabize the word \"font\"
    itself. Using \u0641\u0648\u0646\u062A or \u0641\u0648\u0646\u0637 would then

    to mean point size for example \u201C12 \u0628\u0646\u0637\u201D\r\n\r\nThe idea
    here is to first use as much native Arabic words, and second if we need to Arabize
    Latin words we should do that when there is no escape. I think Arabic has a good
    word for \"point size\", which is \u062D\u062C\u0645 . Why not using it instead?
    Those who originally used \u0628\u0646\u0637 for size did not need to just as
    the Gulf Arabs today use \u0641\u0644\u064A\u062A instead of \u0634\u0631\u064A\u062D\u0629!!\r\n\r\nBut
    since \u0628\u0646\u0637 is used any way and \u0641\u0648\u0646\u062A is not Arabic
    anyway, I think \u0628\u0646\u0637 can be used OK. As for how to pronounce it,
    just add it to the many Arabic words that must remembered without diacritic vowels.\r\n\r\n\u064D\r\n>>So,
