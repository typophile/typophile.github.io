body: "Hi, first post here, not sure if this is the right place to post this, and
  I must apologise for creating a rather selfish first post! I've been lurking and
  meaning to sign up for a long time now, so I'll try to start contributing what I
  can with the little knowledge I have now as a student.\r\n\r\nAnyway, apologies
  out of the way, I'm doing a dissertation which involves looking at a few typefaces
  from various angles, and part of it requires me to look at modern usage of these
  typefaces. And by modern I mean, like, in use in the last year at least.\r\n\r\nThe
  only one I'm struggling with is Caslon, with it being so old and serif and all.
  But, being such a stalwart typeface, I would assume that it must be everywhere,
  and I just can't see it, and I'm hoping you guys will have a better knowledge of
  where it might be!\r\n\r\nThe kind of things I'm looking for are brand identities,
  advertising, newspapers, magazines, books... well, anything really. I know Caslon
  doesn't lend itself so much to brand identity, but I am looking for semi-unusual
  uses, so if anyone knows of it being used in a logo or something like that it would
  be great! I haven't got my hopes up though, so it would be just as well if anyone
  knows of a publishing house that uses it regularly, which I imagine is more likely.\r\n\r\nOr,
  if nobody knows of any notable uses, then if anyone has any insight into why that
  is, then that would be useful too!\r\n\r\nThanks"

    the 1990s. Walk through a big bookstore and pull Knopf books (Knopf does colophons)
    and see which of the Knopf designers is using Calon.

    on typography illustrate that Caslon was still useful today by showing its use
    in closely spaced all-caps in posters for the Leonard J. Waxdeck bird-calling
    contest.\r\n\r\nI know some campuses use Caslon in some form as a typographical
    identity standard.\r\n\r\nWhat I saw of Caslon in some metal type specimen books
    looked horribly dated to me, and it seemed not to resemble older books set in
    Caslon, being an artificially light face. Also, what seemed to me the most widely
    available form of Caslon was Caslon 540, which has short, stubby descenders.\r\n\r\nAdobe
    Caslon may not be \"distinctive\", but when I took a look at it, it certainly
    did seem to be a real Caslon, and to avoid the pitfall of excessive stroke contrast
    that plagues other Caslons. And yet, I can also see how it could be mistaken for
    Baskerville (or some such thing) at a quick glance."

    is too great to get the letter press Caslon reading comfort and aesthetic. Its
    proportions are also half way to Baskerville, and I personally like Caslon's original
    widths in his Roman, I think the rhythm it establishes is one of the original's
    best features. \r\n\r\nMy detailed discussion of Adobe Caslon is in my essay [[http://ilovetypography.com/2010/11/02/reviving-caslon-part-2-readability-affability-authority/|Reviving
    Caslon on ilovetypography.com]].\r\n\r\nThere are also several other recent revivals,
    I think partly in response to the feeling that Adobe Caslon is has its problems.

    Carter's Big Caslon is also a beautiful interpretation of the very large sizes. "

    thought of Baskerville, I wasn't dreaming.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that it has
    gone too far - it's <em>recognizable</em> as a Caslon by looking at the letterforms,
    but it just barely qualifies. I think that it is a highly readable typeface, eminently
    suitable for body copy... and one that might contain 24% lead oxide, but which
    avoids the iron and the cobalt... but, yes, as far as being a \"Caslon\", I would
    agree that a reasonable response would be \"why bother\" - and use Times Roman,
    Caledonia or Century Expanded instead. Baskerville or Garamond would be a definite
    improvement if one was looking to make one's document more unique.\r\n\r\nIf anything,
    though, it accords with my typographical tastes well enough that I've learned
    from it to \"be careful what you wish for\".\r\n\r\nI would not expect anyone
    in his right mind to set body copy in ITC Caslon 223, as one example. I think
    going a bit further in the direction of Adobe Caslon than Williams Caslon does
    is acceptable - but going as far as Adobe Caslon did... yes, I will acknowledge
    that even if it only gets noticed in the typographic community, there are limits
    to how much inauthenticity should be accepted.\r\n\r\nOf course, if they just
    hadn't put the name \"Caslon\" on it, the world would not be hurt by the availability
    of a nice readable Caslon-influenced typeface. But it probably would not have
    been noticed, and one can't blame businesses for being commercial.\r\n\r\nIf hardcover
    fiction is being published in Adobe Caslon, then it has done some good."
