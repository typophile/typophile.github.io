body: "Hi,\r\nI'm reviewing a font with a lot of styles and I have to remove In Point
  BCPs. I don't want to apply the Remove Overlap action to the entire font because
  I don't know what FontLab could do (I really want to be sure of every single action
  working with FL). Anybody know a script that recognizes glyphs with such problems
  so that I could work on them directly? Or something that solves the problem only
  where it is necessary?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMichele"

  body: "Hi Michele,\r\nthis uses RoboFab and calls a \"Merge Contour\" command to
    <em>clean</em> the glyph.\r\nOptionally the script can color the glyph instead
    of calling the Merge Contour so you can edit the contour by yourself.\r\n<code>\r\n#FLM:
    Sanitize BCP\r\n# scriptype - Paolo Mazzetti - 2009\r\nfrom robofab.world import
    CurrentGlyph\r\nfrom FL import *\r\n\r\ng = CurrentGlyph()\r\nfor contour in g:\r\n\ttry:\r\n\t\tfor
    p in contour.bPoints:\r\n\t\t\tif p.bcpIn == p.bcpOut and p.bcpIn == (0,0):\r\n\t\t\t\tfl.CallCommand(fl_cmd.ActionRemoveOverlap)\r\n\t\t\t\t#g.mark
    = 1\r\n\texcept:\r\n\t\tpass\r\ng.update()\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n(Indentation won't
    probably make it)\r\nCheers!"

  body: The AFDKO tool "spot" can do this, I think. Maybe Miguel will comment.
