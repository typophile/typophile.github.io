body: "I\xB4m working on my first typeface. It is supposed to look as if cut out of
  paper. In order to improve the \"handmade\" look, I designed several  glyphs for
  each charakter. (You can see it on the example .png I uploaded. I searched a few
  days but didn\xB4t find an answer to my question: is there a script that makes the
  font choose different glyphs for each charakter incidentally? \r\nUntil now, I have
  to pick every alternative glyph in the glyphs window in indesign, which is too time
  consuming, of course.\r\nAny suggestions? If somebody doesn\xB4t know the answer
  but knows where I could improve my knowledge about open type and python in general,
  this might help, too.\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    it pretty well. It is a recurring question here on Typophile (seems that a lot
    of people wants to do something like that, myself included). You can start your
    search by googling something like\r\n\r\n<code>site:typophile.com random opentype\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"
