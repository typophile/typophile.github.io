  out nicely\u2026\r\n\r\nthe ansermet recording of the boutique fantasque must have
  been rather popular at the time as there is a plentitude of covers for lxt2555 out
  there;\r\non this colourful edition \"rossini respighi\" & \"ballet music\" show
  distinct similarities with renner's 'steile futura' (u.s. marketing name would be
  'topic')\r\nG-maj. does lack the horizontal bar though (a retouche perhaps)\r\nM,
  U and C-maj. are very different however\r\nthe C-maj. has more similarity with the
  infamous DECCA C-maj.\r\nM-maj. with Erbar or Futura\r\nU-maj. is bejond my abilities\r\n\r\nthe
  second font is a slab serif which i couldn't identify.\r\n\r\nspecimen attached;
  not the best quality though\r\n\r\ncheers![img:sites/default/files/old-images/1111_5265.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2222_5506.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3333_6450.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/4444_4976.jpg]"

  body: "i already tried with Bauer Topic - \"rossini-respighi\" works nicely (the
    g might just have been retouch\xE9)\r\ni am quite convinced though that \"ballet
    music\" is just the same font as in the top line (there is a third line - not
    depicted here - with the same font just a little smaller)\r\ni'd love to see a
    complete font here but i suspect that the C-maj. is actually an O-maj. with cut-outs
    in the style of the decca-C.\r\nif one looks closely the U-maj doesn't seem to
    belong at all - top is in line; bottom too low compared with the other letters;\r\nsame
    with the M-maj. - a futura with a little bit of editing.\r\n\r\n\"la boutique\"
    would be quite a disappointment if not available and or identifiable. reminds
    me a lot of remaining local 50s shop-signs"

  body: "I agree that \"BOUTIQUE\" lacks a digital version. This is a creation from
    the photolettering/dry transfer era in which the harsh triangular serifs from
    a nineteenth century font called \"Latin\" [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LatinNotWide_4862.jpg]
    http://www.castletype.com/html/tipoteca/latin-not-wide.html are pasted on a base
    font with vertical strokes having parallel sections and a thick and thin _U_.\r\nCompare
    to Doric which has softer curved triangular serifs which do not quite match.\r\nOr
    \"BOUTIQUE\" could be made by taking a slab serif font with vertical strokes having
    parallel sections and a thick and thin _U_, and converting most of the serifs
    to triangles. \r\nDon"
