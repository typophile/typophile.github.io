body: 'It&#39;s time for another of my semiannual &#34;do you know of a font that
  is like thus-and-so?&#34; posts! =&#41; I hope you guys don&#39;t mind them. <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;m trying to start a zine this summer, and I&#39;m looking for some kind
  of &#40;probably sans-serif, but not necessarily&#41; font that is available in
  very light weights. Like the lighter weights of Gotham, though I&#39;d rather not
  use Gotham if I can help it.  <BR> <BR>I have a curious font that has the general
  sort of look I&#39;m thinking of, called MSDWT Manu. It&#39;s curious because I
  don&#39;t know where it came from or who makes it, and the name doesn&#39;t seem
  like a real name. And it&#39;s only in italics. And is missing most non-alphanumeric
  characters. Here is a sample:  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/40347.jpg"
  alt="msdwt"> <BR> <BR>&#40;No clue what&#39;s up with that %.&#41; Does anyone know
  of anything that looks similar to this? Or even something that is idiosyncratic
  in a different way, like the light weights of Psy/Ops&#39; Armchair Modern &#40;
  <a href="http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_armchair.html" target="_blank">http://www.psyops.com/html/spec_armchair.html</a>
  &#41;.  Though I think that may be a bit too extreme for my purposes, what with
  the lc and uc being the same height. <BR> <BR>za <BR> <BR>ps- congratulate me on
  getting my very first graphic design job! even if it&#39;s 75% medical forms...'
