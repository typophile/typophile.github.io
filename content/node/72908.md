body: "<strong>Forza is Hoefler & Frere-Jones' terrific new family.</strong> A perfect
  broad shouldered companion to their recently released Vitesse (one of my favorite
  modern slabs) or strong on it's own. It was originally a font commissioned by Wired
  Magazine and I had wondered about the sans counterpart to Vitesse in the last issues
  I had picked up, but looks like Jonathan and Tobias new they had a solid one in
  the works. Allows the more discerning typographers/designers less forethought to
  matching Vitesse or other modern square slabs with a sans.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100041\r\n\r\n~
