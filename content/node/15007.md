  body: It seems to be a heavier weight of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/lucida-bright/ef-demi-bold/testdrive.html?s=RUMBI+ISLAND+GRILL&p=48">Lucida
    Bright</a>. Is there such a thing?

  body: "Mark... you're right!\r\nWith a little <a href=\"http://www.acmedigital.net/Aimages/RUMBI.gif\"
    target=\"new\">stretching and arching</a> you can make Lucida Bright Demi Bold
    look like the RUMBI sign. The cap \"G\" just needs a little snip.\r\nExcellent
    catch! =)"
