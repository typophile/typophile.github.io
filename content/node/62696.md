    to squeeze money off anyone they can. It is unfortunate we have come to a point
    were fellow designers are no longer lending that helping hand. I see type as something
    you use in school for free and when you are a working professional you pay for
    it. I doubt many people commenting your post are working professionals so I would
    not take what they say to heart.I do not recall you asking for any free fonts
    just if there where any free ones resembling Georotesque. \r\n\r\nKeep on working.

  body: "The above are experienced designers. As experienced designers they gave you
    experienced opinions. Since you suffer from taste and a keen lack of perspective
    I will elaborate for your benefit.\r\n\r\nThey would have probably guided you
    towards a free typeface meriting similarities to your description had you patience;
    however, when you saw the \"easy\" path towards your goal you took it. Fortunately
    for you, many saw this error and pointed it out to you. Unfortunately, in your
    youthful arrogance you failed to see, identify, and comprehend the advice.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I was in school our teachers advocated that we pay for types if we were to work
    with them. To not do so is unethical, shows a lack of integrity, and a disrespect
    for those whose work you would steal. You would risk arrest for stealing gum at
    the grocery store. Why do you think you should not be flunked and arrested for
    stealing the labors of three years? Did you learn nothing in school or from your
    parents? Great typographers only need one face. Rarely, does one need more than
    two weights or styles. Perhaps, you may need a bold, regular, or italic to set
    an entire book.\r\n\r\nWhy not take advantage of one of the typefaces you already
    have? The great Massimo Vignelli only needed five typefaces: Bodoni, Helvetica,
    Times Roman, Century, Futura. These typefaces likely already exist on your computer.
    A great graphic designer does not need a special face to express themselves. A
    great designer can work with limited means. If you are really in such a dire way
    than so much the better as your creativity will blossom forth vis a vis great
    designers express themselves through concepts. Stealing the work of a typographer
    to make up for a lack of ideas will prove to be failure. If not now, if you are
    lucky, then later in a law suit.\r\n\r\nI am sure that you will need to learn
    the hard way. Most do. Most of us are not as great as Vignelli. \r\n\r\nMr. Danielcorr,
    I am sorry your parents never taught you the value of hard work.\r\n\r\nKeep on
    working. That much is right. Keep working with your own hands is more to the point.
    Mattmc has a great point. Why not draw your own face for your poster? Then, you
    will have laid a challenge for yourself that is worth the pursuit. A pencil and
    paper is cheaply had. Your time is well spent at this. Another opportunity is
    to cut from magazines and make a collage. You can get black and white at the library
    photocopy machine for 5 cents a page, maybe 10 cents. Letters can be made bigger
    or smaller. You can get them from any book in the entire library. If that does
    not help you then hope is forever out of reach."

  body: "Caleb I agree that we \"the designers\" should be looking for the most creative
    source to create ones work, however this was never about creativity. It was about
    professionals helping students. The bit about my parents was just a sorry excuse
    for a joke or a stab at me I am assuming. I can sit here all day and rant about
    great type designers and what \"they did\" but this is no history class and we
    have all seen the Helvetica movie so we can save the knowledge for another blog.
    If you knew anything about typography you would understand that different typefaces
    express different feelings. I have worked with many \"famous\" typographers as
    a graphic designer and many of them are thrilled when students want to use there
    faces for projects. This will be my last post on this entry as I feel this conversation
    is not going anywhere. \r\n\r\np.s. I think many type designers whould be more
    offended with you comparing there work to a pack of gum. \r\n\r\nkeep it real

    I understand where you are coming from, i would not want my work STOLEN, and im
    sure Danielcorr and every designer on this website would either, so how did i
    give you or any of the above \"ANGRY TYPOGRAPHERS\" that i had the EVIL INTENTION
