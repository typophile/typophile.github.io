  Apia, Samoa, 1933.\r\n\r\nJoseph Churchward was born and raised in [[Samoa]]. He
  moved to [[New Zealand]] at age 13 and attended [[Wellington Technical College]].
  There he concentrated on art and especially lettering. He then went on to work as
  a commercial artist at [[Charles Haines Advertising]] for 12 years before setting
  up [[Churchward International Typefaces]] in 1969.\r\n\r\nHis first breakthrough
  was not long in coming. [[Berthold Fototype]] accepted several of his first typefaces
  for distribution and continued to add Churchward\u2019s new designs to their catalogue
  for many years. He later went on to sign distribution agreements with [[D.Stempel
  AG]], [[Dr B\xF6ger Photosatz GmbH]]/[[Linotype]], [[Mecanorma-Polyvroom B.V]] and
  [[Zipatone]]. Churchward International Typefaces published a handful of original
  fonts in 1978 being the first and only company in New Zealand to publish original
  photo-lettering.\r\n\r\nNow officially retired, he continues to create unique alphabets
  and has over 300 original faces to his name."
