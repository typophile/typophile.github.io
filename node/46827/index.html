<p><cite>If you produced expensive, frequently pirated software, you&rsquo;d probably want the process for buying it to be as easy on the customer as possible, right? If you&rsquo;re Adobe, not so much. Yet another reader writes in to share her frustrations with trying to buy Adobe&rsquo;s Dreamweaver.</cite></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never run into issues with upgrading or purchasing Adobe software (granted I don&rsquo;t do the purchasing). But it&rsquo;s interesting that a simple process of upgrading a single product [GoLive CS2 to Dreamweaver CS3] is giving this person such headaches.</p>
<p>Has anyone else encountered similar issues?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve never had any issues either. I buy the software, pop in the disc, it either finds my the serial number from my previous version, or if it&rsquo;s an install on a clean drive, I type in the old one, then the new, let it do its thing, and I&rsquo;m done.</p>
<p>I guess my only issue is that I hate typing in those HUGE serial numbers.</p>
<p>I have the occasional minor glitch installing other software, but nothing like she had. Her problems were quite annoying, but I think it&rsquo;s safe to say they&rsquo;re not the norm.</p>

<p>When upgrading to CS3 (I had CS and Macromedia&rsquo;s MX 2004 Suite) I ordered a stand-alone upgrade for Fireworks, under the mistaken assumption that it would upgrade my Macromedia MX 2004 Suite version of Fireworks. The website and documentation I saw didn&rsquo;t suggest there would be any issues. After installing everything and proving that CS3 Design worked as advertised but Fireworks didn&rsquo;t, I called Adobe to find out why my Fireworks CS3 wasn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>Turns out that the Fireworks CS3 upgrade only updates a stand-alone Fireworks license, not the MX 2004 suite license. Adobe said that I would need to purchase a new, full version of Fireworks. I didn&rsquo;t like that and I really didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;need&rdquo; Fireworks, so instead I went through the &ldquo;Adobe refunds me while I destroy my Fireworks CS 3 copy&rdquo; process. I discovered soon thereafter that several other people were effected by the same lack of information on the Adobe User-to-User forums. And shortly after that, Adobe put up additional information on the website to clarify that you couldn&rsquo;t upgrade to Fireworks CS3 using a Macromedia suite license. And they eventually did a special deal where if you bought the CS3 upgrade they would reduce the price on the full version of Fireworks.</p>
<p>In Adobe&rsquo;s favor, the service reps were very apologetic and professional. But the thing that still bugs me is that they didn&rsquo;t think creatively about how to solve my problem (I wanted an upgrade, not to buy a full new version!) and they could have completely avoided the entire issue if they had the right information online!</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t want to even get started on the Adobe Acrobat &ldquo;Yahoo Search&rdquo; tool and FedEx Kinkos &ldquo;print&rdquo; button. Proof that marketing is taking over the engineers at Adobe&hellip;</p>

<p>Yep. I recall spending 3 days on the phone with Adobe to buy a font.</p>
<p>Adobe is really no different than other giant software companies (or any other semi-monopolistic industry&hellip;yes I&rsquo;m looking at you giant Telco and Cableco).</p>
<p>The support folks are good people, the company/system, not so much.</p>
