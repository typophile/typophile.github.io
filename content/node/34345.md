Maybe a Baskerville?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nav-photo-on_6501.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/nav-design-on_5021.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/nav-contact-on_4689.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/nav-art-on_6514.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much for your help!"

    you used or something?\r\n\r\nBaskerville: it has some of those traits, but the
    tail is a bit <cite>too</cite> open... Although the italic on your site does look
    very Baskerville indeed... Maybe Fountain's cut?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: Yes, it IS the type on my own site - that is the embarassing part. A good
      friend did all of the coding for the site, but he can't remember what face he
      used for the navigation buttons.

  body: It's not Fountain's 1757. The descenders are too short and the tail of the
    "g" is too open.

  body: "Here is the grab I get on my macintosh from the pdf output of a latex source
    that uses the gtamacbaskerville package. The associated font is Monotype Baskerville.
    At that size, with just a bitmap, I can't see the difference. Can you?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/design_3699.gif]"

    body: "That looks VERY close if not exactly it!\r\n\r\nI was thinking that may
      be the case - a Baskerville that when used really small and decreased by Photoshop
      for the web might do that.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!"

    I open with Acroread or Acrobat, at 100%, a pdf file containing those words in
    Baskerville 10pt, I see those open gaps on the screen. If I open the very same
    file with Preview, I don't. I was thus quite lucky to get that close match and
    the hinting would not be enough to explain the gap."
