  I open an InDesign file created on a different computer the the pairing of characters
  \u201Cio\u201D displays as \u0160 (S caron) (see attached). I say display because
  it is recognised as two characters and I can highlight them individually and copy
  them out as \u201Cio\u201D to other applications. Also, I have just noticed \u201Cil\u201D
  displays as \xD5 (O tilde)\u2026\r\n\r\nAny ideas what is going wrong?\r\n\r\nI
  am using Universal Type Client to manage fonts\u2026\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n(Mods,
  feel free to relocate this post if I have used the wrong forum.)"

  body: "(It's funny -- I read this yesterday on my iPad and thought, \"what's so
    special about those characters then?\")\r\n\r\nYour problem has been reported
    a couple of times in the <a href=\"http://forums.adobe.com/community/indesign\">Adobe
    InDesign forums</a> (which, by the way, you'd better avoid for a while as they
    appear to have some serious server malfunction on this Friday the 13th). Extensive
    communication only led to the OPs switching off ligatures, because that <em>seemed</em>
    to be the root cause of the problem.\r\nI am not convinced about that, though.\r\n\r\n<cite>...
    I am using Universal Type Client to manage fonts ...</cite>\r\n\r\nStep 1 is to
    switch this off and see if the problem persists. Possibly it will, possibly not.
    Read on for further clarification.\r\n\r\nStep 2 is -- either with or without
    UTC -- to check in what folder these font files reside; you can use Find Font's
    \"More Info\" button for that. Is the location some place you could reasonably
    expect?\r\n\r\nStep 3, finally, is to scan your entire hard disk for other versions
    of this same font. You cannot rely on the <em>file name</em> for this; InDesign
    reaches into the files and uses the actual Font Family Name and Full Name, no
    matter what the file is actually called.\r\n\r\nMy reasoning is that you might
    have several different versions of the same font set of Frutiger, but with slightly
    different features. InDesign cannot handle same name/different versions of fonts
    and is prone to nervous breakdowns if it encounters these, rather than just popping
    up an alert."

  body: "Ah -- you can use the information from Step 2 to make Step 3 a bit easier
    :D\r\n\r\nStep 2 will tell you which file(s) InDesign is currently using. So reach
    into your computer and make these files not-available (move them somewhere else,
    delete them, I don't know).\r\nIf InDesign still displays your file as if nothing
    happened, you know for sure it found the very same font set <em>somewhere else</em>.\r\n\r\nRepeat
    this until ID finally acknowledges it cannot find the font anymore, because possibly
    you have more than <em>two</em> versions of the font as well! Then choose any
    of the complete sets you have and install only that one."
