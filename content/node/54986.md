  a great way to protect and grow income. Why? Nowadays, successful freelance writing
  jobs offer the chance of earning a good income, while working from the comfort of
  home and spending less to get started. \r\n\r\nThe question now turns to how can
  an aspiring freelance writer be successful in such field? What are the basic tricks
  in becoming one of the next proficient and profit-generating freelance writers?
  Here are some tips:\r\n\r\n<strong>Create a clear cut between work and home.</strong>
  \ \r\nIt\u2019s always efficient to have a division between work and home although
  freelance writers do most of their task at home. It is advisable to have <a href=\"http://www.aolcdn.com/living_nyny/103-home-office-space-12-438x328jf010207.jpg\">a
  designated work space</a>. An office or studio space outside of the house is preferable.
  If not possible, create a home office with a door is the next best option. If still
  not applicable, go to your local Pier 1 and buy a Chinese screen and section off
  a corner of a room and viola \u2013 an instant office. \r\n\r\n<strong>Dress up
  and take off the pajamas.</strong>  \r\nIt\u2019s more inspiring to work if you\u2019ll
  <a href=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/248/461497568_36f89065d6.jpg\">dress like
  you\u2019re going to the office</a>. Why? Because indeed you are. Even if your \u201Coffice\u201D
  is only your kitchen table, wearing regular work clothes puts you into the right
  mind-set.\r\n\r\n<strong>Go to work on time.</strong>  \r\nOne of the best things
  that freelance writers enjoy is the luxury of hassle-free commuting. However, this
  does not mean that you can go to work whatever time you\u2019d like. You\u2019ve
  already bought yourself a little time out of the travel-free set up of freelance
  writing. So go ahead and grab that extra cup of coffee but it\u2019s better for
  your clients and personal sanity if you keep at a relatively <a href=\"http://www.azsignshop.com/images/business-hours.gif\">normal
  business hours</a>. \r\n\r\n<strong>Don\u2019t watch TV while working.</strong>
  \r\nNever mix pleasure with business as they say. You\u2019re working, so go and
  work. However, occasional naps are acceptable and a great way to be reminded that
  while you might not have a technical support, you still have a pretty awesome working
  life.\r\n\r\n<strong>Have regular breaks and go out to lunch.</strong> \r\nWriting
  life, especially freelance writing life, can be isolating and tiring. And everybody
  knows that isolation can lead to one serious thing: insanity. So practice taking
  regular breaks just like what usual working people do. It is also ideal to go out
  to lunch sometimes so as to free and freshen up your mind.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot
  of other things that can contribute to being one of those successful <a href=\"http://www.writers.ph/\">freelance
  writers</a>, like meeting deadlines and not annoying the clients. But those things
  are better figured out through experiences. In the meantime, put that remote control
  down and get to work.\r\n"
