body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI'm having some difficulty finding a Hebrew face that works
  well with Centaur. I'd like to find a Hebrew font that has some of the similar character
  of Centaur, but reads well. I'm using Centaur all caps letter spaced for the family
  name of a grave marker, but I need to add in Hebrew. Of course, I'll run the design
  by the family Rabbi, but since I can't read Hebrew I need a little help. I'm thinking
  something in the calligraphic tradition without having the traditional \"Hebrew
  wave\". I'd like it to be clean and elegant in a early 20th century romantic way,
  with a little \"woodiness\". Is that a word, \"woodiness\"? I mean the way that
  Centaur has the tree branch look.\r\n\r\nAny help or direction would be greatly
  appreciated!"

  body: "David: Maybe I need to be more specific... Since I don't read Hebrew, I feel
    that I need to be cautious in picking a font. Something that looks elegant to
    me, might look like a silly letterform to someone that is familiar with Hebrew.
    It's not really a problem, that I can't read it, but more of an issue with cultural
    nuance.\r\n\r\nHrant: \"Hebrew wave\" is definitely not an exact term. I use it
    to describe the stroke flourishes that cap the letterforms and indicate forward
    movement. It seems that the more traditional calligraphic forms have wavier forms
    and that the modern calligraphic forms are more subtle. See <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/masterfont/margaliot-mf/\">Margaliot</a>
    as an example of the wavy forms. All this being said, maybe the traditional calligraphy
    would be a better match to Centaur."

    think so - if it's not overdone.\r\nNarkisim is a bit stiff here - a better match
    for something like Bembo.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
