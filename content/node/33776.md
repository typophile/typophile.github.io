body: "hya people :D\r\nim currently working on a quick logo for a little company
  which does \"brain fitness\" workshops. that is, they make workshops that present
  challenges for elderly people, to prevent brain deterioration. \r\nso the concept
  is \"brain fitness\". and im looking for a sporty font, something with boldyness,
  but with good motion and a very vibrant attitude. all i found untill now is slanted
  slab serif, but again im looking for something beyond, im looking for the motion.\r\nthanks\r\nYaronimus"

    is very '70s-'80s, but maybe you can make it work with some modifications.
