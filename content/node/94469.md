  body: "the different shape of same letters like Es Ts As etc. indicate that is either
    hand drawn or a special deformation envelope is used on each letter.\r\nIf you
    want to reconstruct it you can try using a similar font \r\nlike e.g. <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Font-Bureau&ffam=BureauGrotesque%20ThreeFive%20-%20Regular&fstyle=&fsize=60&fid=50a88decd5d0cd28a28d96989abd19dd&wrap=2&text=MARIE%20ANTOINETTE|Bureau

  body: "Agree with fvilanakis. Looks like they distorted some generic condensed sans.
    It could also have been manually slanted. I'm sure it would be not so hard to
    reproduce the same effect starting, for instance, with some generic sans like
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica-neue/cond-bold-obl/|Helvetica Condensed
    Bold Oblique]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/univers/UniqueName-217369-115593/|Univers
    Condensed Bold Oblique]]. For the rest, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/bureau-grot/cond-medium/|Bureau
    Grot Condensed Medium]] suggested by fvilanakis is probably one of the best approximation
    you could get to me.\r\n"
