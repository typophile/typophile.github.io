  invitation? I'm after a serif font, that looks modern, with a slight hint of art
  deco (if that's at all possible?). I'm not after a font that screams art deco, and
  looks as though its from that period of history, but perhaps something that takes
  a few influences?\r\n\r\nAny help, guidance, or suggestions welcomed.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDave"

    elegant enough for a wedding invitation, at the very least."
