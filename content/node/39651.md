  a dismal knowledge of typography in general ) sure I love this forum and all the
  work and knowledge it has to offer.\r\n\r\nBut what about actual real world usage?\r\n\r\nI'd
  love any recommendations where one can see real world usage, grid layout applications,
  newspaper magazine etc layout.\r\n\r\nForums, blogs etc are what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nCheers
  :)"

    I'm looking.\r\nI had already noticed before a fair amount of newspaper layout
    designed blogs etc but something destined to the page itself in a regular periodical
    setting seldom gets spoken about.\r\n\r\nthanks and if possible keep them coming
    :)"
