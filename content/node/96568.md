  pixel density and new hand-tuned fonts.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>All six fonts on Kindle
  Paperwhite have been hand-tuned at the pixel level for maximum readability and comfort.
  Higher resolution allows for unprecedented sharpness. The new high-resolution display
  allows for elegant typeface options including Baskerville and Palatino.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThese
  new fonts also appeared in an update to the Kindle iPad and iPhone apps on Sep 21,
  and I was eager to check them out. However, I found that the Baskerville doesn't
  seem to work that well, at least to my eyes. I'd be interested to read opinions
  from the experts here. \r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot showing Amazon's Baskerville
  (it's huge because of the pixel density at capture, but I thought that would be
  better than resampling to a smaller size):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Amazon_Baskerville_crop_300_5071.png]\r\n\r\nIt
  seems to have uneven color. The uppercase letters seem darker than the lowercase.
  Okay, maybe Baskerville is just not a good choice for use on a tablet? So I looked
  at Linotype Baskerville in the Fontbook app:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Linotype_Baskerville_Fontbook_crop_300_4841.png]\r\n\r\nSeems
  to have a more even color. What do you think?"

  body: "Good topic.\r\n\r\nThere are many gremlins running around here.\r\n\r\n1)
    There are different Baskervilles. This one seems to be ITC New Baskerville, which
    to me isn't a \"classical\" cut, so not very authentic. But I guess that's not
    the main thrust of this thread.\r\n\r\n2) Some fonts -especially older ones- intentionally
    have hefty caps. For a clue, look how the caps are additionally very tall.\r\n\r\n3)
    It's very difficult to compare emissive screens (LCD) and reflective screens (E
    Ink) by proxy. And fonts optimized for one are unlikely to work very well for
    the other.\r\n\r\n4) I agree that Baskerville is not a great choice for a tablet,
    but for an e-reader I think it would work.\r\n\r\nBTW, to compare UC-lc relationships,
    maybe show more than seven \"U\"s and an \"I\"... And anyway Linotype Baskerville
    is a quite different animal than ITC New Baskerville.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Just pointing it out."

  body: "\"It seems to have uneven color.\"\r\n\r\nTo some extent, it's being viewed
    larger than intended, and to another extent this is the old pitfall of too many
    jobs for each character.  \r\n\r\n\"Okay, maybe Baskerville is just not a good
    choice for use on a tablet?\"\r\n\r\nI think, historically, and according to modern
    studies, what makes a good choice should depend on the material, not the device,
    the app, OS, WC3 or initially, even the user! As resolution and mobility increase
    (again), the initial type selection for most material should be done where it
    used to be done. \r\n\r\nI also think that it's fabulous there is now some choice
    in this application, considering the rather wide range of material it presents. "

  body: "Hrant, thanks for your feedback. I appreciate your observation that it's
    difficult to compare LCD and e-ink screens by proxy, and that a font optimized
    for e-ink might not work as well with LCD. Amazon stated that these fonts were
    optimized for the new Kindle Paperwhite, which made me wonder whether the Baskerville
    would work well on the iPad. I'll be interested to see how well it works on the
    Paperwhite.\r\n\r\nKentlew, thanks for directing me to Monotype Baskerville. Actually
    both the ITC New Baskerville and Monotype Baskerville seem closer to the Amazon
    Baskerville than the Linotype Baskerville that I had been comparing. In the Fontbook
    app, I noticed that the Monotype Baskerville caps also seem slightly darker than
    lowercase, though not as much as the Amazon Baskerville. So maybe Amazon's type
    designers didn't introduce this with their optimization?\r\n\r\nEliason, I agree
    that the word spacing isn't good. The app formats text with full justification
    and no hyphenation, so it's loose. Apple's iBook app has options to turn on hyphenation
    and ragged right justification, which improve word spacing. I wish Amazon would
    provide these options in their apps.\r\n\r\nDberlow, I'd like to see ebook designers
    start embedding well-chosen faces. The new Kindle Format 8 supports this. With
    most ebooks that I've read, however, the publisher hasn't taken advantage of this
    capability. And with the one ebook I've read with an embedded font, the publisher/designer
    chose Droid Sans for a history book about the Navy in WWII. Ugh. I checked the
    view-inside option for the paper version of the same book, and I found that the
    designer chose Goudy Old Style. I would've been fine with that for the ebook.
    I have no idea what they were thinking.\r\n\r\nI wasn't looking for trouble when
    I started reading a book with this face, but after a while I felt something wasn't
    quite right. I squinted to look at the page slightly out of focus and noticed
    the dark caps. Since then, I've finished that book and started another. I've become
    less distracted by the color and don't notice it as much as when I first started
    using this face."
