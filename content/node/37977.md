body: "This is my first attempt at anything resembling a typeface / font. This is
  a result of a few (5-6) hours work over the weekend in an attempt to kill some down
  time. \r\n\r\nThis is still in the very early stages, and I am annoyed by all the
  details I am seeing that I failed to address before posting this image.However,
  I thought this would be a good time to get some feedback and advice on what to avoid
  going forward from this point, as well as what you feel works well in the current
  image. \r\n\r\nThe featured Super Duty typeface was my inspiration to really start
  playing around with a bold and heavy display face. My concept is a symmetrical and
  powerful type, built around a single squared form. Ideally, each of these letters
  would use only those few simple shapes, and all would contain the same amount of
  area... optically at least.\r\n\r\nEnough of that. Here is what you see below:\r\n\r\nFirst
  Line: My initial hashing out of the concept\r\n\r\nSecond + partial third line:
  I revisited this a day later, and decided that I wanted a lot more weight and emphasis,
  thus the much heavier treatment. Also, I set the name of the type in cyan: BRUTALE\r\n\r\nFourth
  Line: My last name (maurer) set and scaled up just to see how it went...\r\n\r\nThat
  is about it, let me know what you think."

  body: "This is really excellent.  It's very modern and flowing and at the same time
    heavy and reminiscent of fonts from the '30s.\r\n\r\nI prefer the f,g,h, and m
    from the lighter, first version. The descender on the f and g convey a lot of
    personality, as do the chopped stems on h and m. I also prefer the a & c in the
    heavier, second version.  I think the heavier weight works much better, so I'd
    say take the f,g,h, and m from the light version and make heavy variants of them.
    \r\n\r\nThe k is fantastic, but it might be too radical to be readable. I'd like
    to see some text to see how distinguishable the k is from h, in context.  \r\n\r\nThe
    s doesn't work, it's too curvy and the separated top makes it look like it's been
    misplaced from a disco typeface from the '70s. \r\n\r\nThe x is going to be hard...
    take a cue from your k. And you should think about the s and the z at the same
    time.\r\n\r\nYou may have two faces here; a more-readable text face and a more-radical
    headline or alternates face.  And whatever you do, it should be available in both
    weights. \r\n\r\nKeep working on this. I look forward to seeing a more complete
    version. :)"

  body: "i like the notion. these chunky monostrokes are a fun reductive process,
    and this paticualr shape vocabulary has a real \"means business\" tone to it.
    reminds me of some early eighties faces.\r\n\r\nwatch your horizontal strokes.
    they look markedly thicker than the verticals at the moment. nature of the beast;
    you'll have to actually make them thinner when you get a little further from your
    grid. when i'm doing faces like this, my general process is to do a first version
    which is strictly on the grid, then a second which \"warms up\" the forms with
    some optical correction -- things like narrowed horizontal strokes, narrowing
    of spaces where corners and diagonals meet.\r\n\r\nso, i think your s as it stands
    now is out of line with the rest of the face. it's the one piece which has any
    indication of a calligraphic strike -- i'm talking about the rounded terminals
    which indicate stroke direction. you should probably either do another version
    which carries that idea forward, but it'll probably be a challenge to do so without
    looking like something from the nineties."

    fear the X since I have not looked at it yet, and fear the S because I have! I

  body: i think you should do both of them. the S is actually the more played out
    of the two gestures at the moment; the nineties had half-lozenge caps all over
    the place. i am now peering down my nose at your CD's notions of contemporary.

  body: "I agree with the others -- a lot of interesting things going on in here.
    I can easily see this being used on CD covers and concert posters. It's very 2000's.
    The \"s\" seems very 90s to me, and doesn't fit with the rest. The K, while interesting,
    I think is just so unusual you're going to lose everyone trying to read it.\r\n\r\nI
    do prefer the bolder version since it has the extra shapes that make it dramatically
    more readable (the \"e\" has the clearest difference for such a minor change in
    shape) but of course the lighter one seems to be more the \"seed\" of the idea."

    is pretty interesting, I feel like it is a bit too floral for my tastes, and also
    that it's possible usages would be far more limited that the main focus in this
    image.\r\n\r\nMerriam, I hear you on the \"k,\" I think I would like to keep it
    and make it an alternate though, it is one of those things like the Conduit Bold
    Italic E, that just screams look at me and proves to be distracting, but that
    I still really dig. \r\n\r\nAll your input has been great, I am looking forward
    to refinining this further and seeing if you guys think took it right or wrong."

  body: yeah, i was going to say as well, i think the S is more nineties than naughties
    (and by extension, i am suspicious of your CD's taste level). i don't think it's
    bad, but i swear to god, we had truncated lozenges EVERYWHERE from 1992 to 1998.
    it was the ravers' faults. i like the chunky forms better.

  body: "Ha, Patrick, I should defend the CD here. I don't think that his sentiments
    were quite as strong as you think. I think what he actually expressed was that
    it did seem like something from the eighties and nineties... which is not necessarily
    a bad thing. He thought the s may be able to lead to a type that was a bit more
    unique. \r\n\r\nI would not question his taste, it is quite good, and usually
    better than mine \u2013 otherwise, I would not dream of working under him. It
    was definitely some pretty rapid fire feedback, and those sentiments were in the
    midst of congratulating me on my ambition to pursue anything of this nature \u2013

    It might fit with the others better.\r\n- What if the down turned line at the
    top of the e turned again to the inside slightly. I know it breaks an implicet
    rule but maybe it would read better. \r\n- I think some judicious use of diagolals
    could enliven the face and help to solve for y z & x.\r\n- What about crossing
    the t on only the right side & extending the lines further to make the glyph match
    the others a bit more closely?\r\n- What about curving the upper right corner
    of the q?\r\n- What about a hard corner in the w?"

  body: "Hey Eben,\r\n\r\nYup, I had thought about that on the M and W as well, it
    would make much more sense. In the same vein, I thought flipping the c or g so
    that they rounded on alternate edges and carrying that throughout would make this
    more consistent as well. \r\n\r\nWe will see on the diagonal, I would prefer not
    to, but if it is necessary may be a way to go. I definitely need to refine most
    of my horizontals vs verticals right now, and actually the T as it is now sticks
    in my craw so to speak. \r\n\r\nAll good comments, and all definitely tie in to
    the style more than the set right now. I think you will see that some of those
    decisions were played iwth in the light form above. (i.e. the C vs the G, as well
    as the M) I will be going back to the proper reasoning, think i was rushing the
    bolder because I was digging it, and did not apply as much reason as I should
    of. \r\n\r\nThanks for the thoughts though, definitely in line with the face on
    most your points i think."

  body: "I am glad the ideas seem helpful to you for the most part. \r\n\r\nThe other
    thing that occurs to me is that you may want to offer alternative forms. The basic
    set might be more radical. And the alternatives could be a way of making a word
    more readable. Or the reverse. \r\n\r\nIf you have just two versions you might
    put one kind in the lowercase & the other in the upper. Or if you can make Opentype
    you could have 3 or more alternative forms that are selectable by the user. \r\n\r\nThe
    other thing is that if you start to feel beaten on the z for instance don't forget
    that this is really really well trodden territory design-wise. Many many people
    have made faces like this! So you may want to go look at Bauhaus stuff, Weiner
    Werkstatte, and the various forms invented by designers and ravers from the 80's
    forward.\r\n\r\nsee also \r\n\r\nhttp://www.t26.com/fonts/style/Techno?page=4\r\nhttp://www.youworkforthem.com/list.php?cat=46\r\n\r\nThere

    you can further develop all of the glyphs to move into something that ends up
    being a happy in-between.  More specifically, something that is still chunky but
    also has a little bit of the elegance of that 's'.
