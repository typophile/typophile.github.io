    to Downer's point:\r\nPeople like it, finding it easy to read, simply because
    it's so BIG.\r\n\r\nBut the winner must be:\r\n\"I have an elderly academic relative
    who regularly changes\r\nthe typeface when sending word processed letters to avoid\r\nwearing
    the software out. He's a fan of letterpress printing\r\nand even hand composition
    when available.\"\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
