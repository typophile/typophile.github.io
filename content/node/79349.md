  could tell me the interest there is to add lookup if I already made a -salt- feature
  (for example) with my classes ?\r\nFor example I have this feature :\r\n\r\nfeature
  salt {\r\n  sub @reg_lc by @alt_lc ;\r\n      sub @reg_uc by @alt_uc ;\r\n          sub
  @reg_sc by @alt_sc ;\r\n} salt;\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy would I need to add lookups and what
  way would they improve my font ? I don't really get the big interest there is behind
  lookups. Could anyone explain it with more simple words than the Fontlab manual
  :)"

    repeating the feature code. \r\n(For instance, you might want the same substitution
    to be active in multiple different language systems. First, you wrap the feature
    code in the lookup; later, you just call the lookup again.).\r\n\r\n[[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#4.e]]"

  body: Ok thanks. It is a little bit clearer. But I need to include lookups in case
    I have some issues with complex situations. If I have some basics alternate characters
    to replace and if my salt feature do the job fine, do I really need to add it
    ? I mean I can live without it (if my fonts features works fine), right ?

  body: Yes, the font will also work just fine without lookups.

  body: The feature file compiler will take care of building lookups behind the scene,
    I think allowing defining features without lookups is merely syntactic sugar.

  body: "A thing I forgot to mention: \r\nLookups will go and jump back to the beginning
    of a line before doing their job.\r\nConsequently, by including a handful of lookups,
    you can actually make more complex substitutions happen than would be possible
    with a single-glyph treatment."

  body: That is what I understood. But as my font is only replace this glyph by this
    glyph without any contextual swapping, I'll dig into lookups when I really need
    it :D
