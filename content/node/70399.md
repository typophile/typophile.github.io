  resolved. Anyone know if a hairline version of Gill Sans has ever been digitized?
  \r\n\r\nThere's a poster that Deitch Project did a few years ago to promote a show
  called \"The Studio of the Street\" which had a photo of Jean Michel Basquiat. (See
  it <a href=\"http://deitch.com/projects/sub.php?projId=188\">here</a>.) It featured
  a beautiful sans that appeared to indeed be Gill Sans Hairline, but I've found no
  digitized version of this anywhere. \r\n\r\nAnybody know of such a thing?\r\n\r\nThanks
  all...!"

    looking for something similar P22 Underground Pro has an extremely thin weight. "

    is closest that I can think of. It is quite close, but there are some noticeable
    minor differences.

  body: Verlag, much as I love it (H&FJ just do beautiful things, what can I say?),
    is definitely a different beast. The bones are there, but clothes are most certainly
    of another personality. I had forgotten all about that Underground Pro release
    and it's absolutely fantastic work. What gives me pause with Underground is its
    lack of Itals. but a good call nonetheless. Thanks!

  body: and wouldn't you know I just came across a hairline drawing of Gill just today
    and was reminded of this post. James Montalbano's Skinny Eric, a custom-drawn
    "painfully thin" (!) cut of Gill for SELF. It may be painful, but it sure is pretty....In
    the end, though, I did end up buying Underground, and I've been quite pleased
    with its result in the project. Thanks all for all the great ideas!
