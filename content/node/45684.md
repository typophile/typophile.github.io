  mine and I am really appreciate if you guys can give me some comments and suggestions.
  I designed my typeface by modifying a few san-serif typefaces. Also, I am trying
  to incorporate pensil sketch with vector to create this typeface. I experimented
  with two different colors, yellow and light brown.\r\n\r\nChriswong[img:sites/default/files/old-images/u_5339.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/u1_4587.jpg]"

    is distracting, F is too light,  Looking at your overall design; C look like O.\r\n\r\n<cite>I

    a good idea.\r\n\r\n"

    don't recommend that. For experimental purposes or for reference to learn something
    out of it, fine, but if you are going to create your own typeface, create it from
    scratch. That's when you really learn a lot and become a better type designer
    from that. Also, it gives your face something that is a necessity: <em>originality</em>."

    idea. I agree. It's pretty.\r\n\r\nBut we are all guessing about your intent.
    Give us more background and we are less likely to leap to the wrong conclusion."

  body: Hi guys, thanks for the comments, the typeface is actually designed for a
    type poster of one of my school project, definitely i am aware of using someone
    else typeface to make it my own. I am trying to give more originality to my design
    now. The attached sketch is my original initial idea. Anyway thanks again for
    all the comments.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/h_6364.jpg]

  body: "The thing that seems to stand out that could use some tweaking is the scribbled
    lines that are part of curves, like in the C, D and G. I wish they would follow
    the curve better, they seem a little stiff, especially for scribbles. I might
    also suggest instead of the scribbling, you try hatchmarks and cross-hatchmarks,
    something a little more refined and consistent.\r\n\r\nI agree with Stephen; tis
    a fine poster."
