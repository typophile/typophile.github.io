  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've asked this already on FL list, but now think that this might be a more better platform fot my question. <BR> <BR>I have a question concerning Catalan middot in PC TTF. I generated fonts in FL with a standard Latin 1, <BR>1252 encoding, and the middot (aka periodcentered) had 00B7 unicode value, yet it seems that it doesn't function properly on a PC. Now I am looking around and see that other values e.g., 22C5, 2219 are also used. Does anyone know where are these values coming from? Is it necessary to encode the middot to all three of them? <BR> <BR>Is there a know issue about using middot in various PC applications? Does anyone have experience with this? <BR> <BR>Thank you, Peter</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Peter,  <BR> <BR>1. Instead of using arbitrary names for your glyphs (&quot;middot&quot;), I suggest that you use standardized names listed in the Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts 1.1 (in your case, &quot;periodcentered&quot;).  <BR> <BR>You will find all the Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts 1.1 at <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/aglfn13.txt" target="_blank"><a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/aglfn13.txt">http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/aglfn13.txt</a></a>  <BR> <BR>2. For glyph names that are not in the Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts, check whether the glyph is a basic (default) form of a character encoded in the Unicode Standard. If so, use the Unicode-based glyph name:  <BR>a) for BMP Unicode codepoints, use the name &quot;uniXXXX&quot; where XXXX are the 4 hexadecimal digits representing the codepoint.  <BR>b) for non-BMP Unicode codepoints, use the name &quot;uXXXXX&quot; where XXXXX are the 5 hexadecimal digits representing the codepoint.  <BR> <BR>3. If a glyph is an alternate form of a character that is encoded in the Unicode Standard or is listed in the Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts 1.1, use the glyph name of the basic form followed by a period, followed by a suffix. For the suffix, use the name of the OpenType Layout feature that you would most likely access that glyph through.  <BR> <BR>For example, for a small-caps A, use &quot;A.smcp&quot;, for a styllistic alternate R use &quot;R.salt&quot;, for a swash Q use &quot;Q.swsh&quot;, for a superior m use &quot;m.sups&quot;, for a tabular 5 use &quot;five.tnum&quot; etc. If there are multiple OpenType Layout features that can be used to access a glyph, pick one of your liking.  <BR> <BR>4. If a glyph is a ligature that is not found in the Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts, use the glyph names of the glyphs that form the ligature, concatenated using underscore. For example, for a ct ligature, use &quot;c_t&quot;, for an ffi ligature use &quot;f_f_i&quot;, for a ligature of long s and i use &quot;longs_i&quot;.  <BR> <BR>5. If a glyph is an ornament, a non-textual symbol etc., use a glyph name of your liking.  <BR> <BR>6. Assign proper Unicode indexes to the glyphs discussed in (1) and (2). If the same glyph represents more than one Unicode character:  <BR>a) create multiple glyphs with identical content but different names, and assign one Unicode codepoint per glyph; for example, create a &quot;periodcentered&quot; glyph and encode it as U+00B7, and create a &quot;uni2219&quot; glyph and encode it as U+2219.  <BR>b) alternatively, either assign multiple Unicode codepoints to your glyph; for example, for &quot;periodcentered&quot;, assign U+00B7 and U+2219.  <BR> <BR>7. For glyphs discussed in (3), (4), (5), you may but don't have to assign custom codepoints from the Unicode Private Use Area (PUA): from U+E000 to U+F8FF. I recommend against assigning these codepoints, but for some applications (e.g. Microsoft Word 2003 for Windows), assigning PUA codepoints may be the only way to display such glyphs in your font.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.  <BR></div>

I've looked into this some more, and I think I may be mistaken in my identification of 2219 as the correct codepoint for the Catalan dot. I thought this was noted on the MST website somewhere, but I cannot find the reference now and instead note this, from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/diacritics.htm">Diacritics Design Standards</a>: <BR><i> <BR><b>L or l Catalan (L with mid dot) </b> <BR>This character is actually a compound character made from a base character and an additional punctuation character. The mid dot is used in the Catalan language to separte two lowercase l or two uppercase L characters that are not part of the same syllable in a word.  <BR> <BR>The mid dot is commonly made from the overdot diacritic U+02D9 or a character made specifically for this purpose. Often the period U+002E, period centered U+2219 or mid dot U+00B7 are not an appropriate size for this character. The dot in the L or l Catalan character should be positioned to center vertically on the uppercase height and center horizontally when followed by another L or l. </i> <BR> <BR>This seems to me very unsatisfactory, because although the U+02D9 <i>glyph,</i> is an appropriate size for the Catalan dot, it is not necessarily the appropriate character code to use. <BR> <BR>Peter, try this: In WordPad on Windows, enter the Catalan dot from your Catalan keyboard &ndash; resulting in a .notdef glyph I presume &ndash; and then enter alt+X this will convert the preceding character to a hexadecimal character code, so you can confirm exactly what Unicode value is input from the Catalan keyboard.</div>

I figured how it could be solved, but I was wondering why there would be different codepoints for the same glyph, and whether it is the same glyph or it is also used in different languages or situations.

		<div class="commentbody">I should mention I tested this on Window 2000.  <BR> <BR>In 1999 I talked to the person who wrote the keyboard table that maps the character codes to unicode. I found it coming out as x2219. And told her that that is a 'math operator' and in that section of unicode and is probably wrong.  <BR> <BR>Back then I was testing it on Windows 95 and I have it recorded in the MS document that x2219 came up in Win95 and xB7 in Win2000.  <BR> <BR>xB7 is more correct so I hope that is what changed.  <BR> <BR>I'm sure this adds to the confusion but never trust a programmer so always test it against what they do&hellip;  <BR> <BR></div>
