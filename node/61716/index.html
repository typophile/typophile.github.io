  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Fellow typophiles—

This issue confounds me. I am attempting to type a "c" in Word with a grave accent and the character simply isn't recognized. The type is Times New Roman (and I tried Helvetica Neue for kicks) and to no avail.

Is this even a recognized character typically? It is the final letter of a last name belonging to a Croatian young man, to whom I am attributing an essay, hence my need.

Also a lot of the older Microsoft fonts don't have extended character sets. If you have some of the Adobe fonts that come with apps such as the creative suites you can get extended language coverage, but I'd still doubt a cgrave would be included.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems that it will take some time for all the capabilities of Unicode to make it into common use. What's needed involves (a) operating systems, (b) applications program, (c) and fonts.

I do know that what you want to do is easy enough with Windows Vista, running either Wordpad, Notepad, Open Office 3.01 (free) or MS Word in the newer releases.

I do not know about Macs, nor have I tested Windows XP -- at least, not lately.

OK, that's operating systems and applications programs.  The font people have dragged their feet. Fortunately, SIL Charis (free & a pretty good typeface for writing manuscripts) has all the combining diacritics encoded. The combining diacritics really are needed with the Unicode system.

So, I know the following will work, with Windows Vista, Open Office (& Wordpad & Notepad & some releases of Word), and the font Charis:

Type a "c." (Make sure the "num lock" is "on.") Now, hold down the "Alt" key, and with it held down, using the number keypad, enter the string 0300 (Unicode for combining grave accent). release the "Alt key."

The above paragraph is simply one way of directly entering a Unicode character from the keyboard with a Windows program. Likely there is a corresponding way to do so with a Mac. If you're using a Mac, you can test things out as well. It is easier if you can eliminate one of the potential problem areas, so start with a font that has the combining accents completed, and maybe even good *mark* and *mkmk* features, such as Charis.

In sum, the font Charis is free (search for "download Charis") The Open Office products are free, and can even write off a .doc format. (Search for Open Office). For operating system support & upgrade, you're on your own.

Good Luck,

Charles</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On the macintosh, I use the IPA-SIL keyboard that can be downloaded from SIL <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=UniIPAKeyboard"><strong>IPA Unicode Keyboards</strong></a> (IPA = <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>). The keyboard is also available for Windows and Linux but I have never tried it on those platforms.

To type c with a grave accent with the IPA-SIL keyboard, just type c and then SHIFT 4 (c with acute is c SHIFT 2). You can switch fast between the American keyboard and the IPA keyboard by just typing "apple space". 

With Word 2008 for the macintosh, what I just described works fine with the Microsoft Calibri and Cambria fonts but not with Times New Roman; <a href="http://www.sil.org/computing/catalog/show_software_catalog.asp?by=cat&name=Font"><strong>SIL fonts</strong></a> Charis and Gentium also have those accents (and others) and what is necessary to position them above the previous character (that always needs to be in the same font).

You will notice Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, Sun, and others.

Isn't it sad that support of accented characters, a part of the Unicode Standard, isn't (yet) much supported?

All James wants to do is enter one character with an accent. It looks like the occurrence of this character is one time. He shouldn't need a special keyboard. (There are numerous languages where the isn't a special keyboard available.) If the fonts (from Adobe, from Microsoft) have combining diacritics, he should be able to directly enter the base character and the accent, if the applications program (Microsoft) & operating system (Microsoft, Apple, Sun,) allow/help/don't get in the way.</div>

On the macintosh, for a one time character like U+0300 (combining grave accent), one can just double click on the character 0300 in the character palette to insert it in the current application. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can touch-type all the diacritics that have come standard with Mac keyboards since ’84, but that doesn’t mean I don’t resort to brute-force methods from time to time. For “very unusual” diacritics, including ć, I just looking up the Unicode character and copy and paste it. This method will not work for truly arbitrary combinations (like circumflex on ç or that sort of thing). There are now huge numbers of utilities for locating Unicode characters online.

Now, rather sadly, we have a word set in Garamond ending with a TNR "c"!

But this is of no consequence: this is only a draft. I'm simply doing it so that the editors will know that the "c" is indeed accented. They can worry about placing the accent in whichever type they choose to set.</div>
