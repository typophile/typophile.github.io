  body: It&#39;s probably handdrawn. <BR>Mark&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/">
    Mostra</a> is a nice digital alternative.

  body: At the risk of steering you away from Mostra &#40;thanks, Yves and Eduardo,
    for suggesting it&#41;, you might also look at <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=203482">Mahlau</a>,
    which appears to be a closer match, especially if you want those S&#39;s.
