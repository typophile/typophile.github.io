  the typeface or know of one similar for the Z in the attached logo for Zemaitis
  guitars? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

  body: It's probably hand-drawn. Why do you think it's from a typeface? Is there
    other matching lettering somewhere?

  body: "Zemaitis has such amazing hand engraving (the real stuff, not like the directed
    scratches you get at a trophy shop), that it must have been hand drawn Tony Zemaitis
    himself. You might even write the company in England and see if they know (Tony
    passed away a few years ago). It sort of reminds me of lettering I've seen on
    western saddles, which probably doesn't help much in finding a similar font. \r\n\r\nMy
    specialty is our own guitars, but I do love musical instruments of all types!"

  body: Good suggestion on contacting the company...and Western saddles might be a
    good search term for fonts. Thanks Mica!
