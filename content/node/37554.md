  body: You don't want the version they had available before. At least, I didn't.
    Very buggy. I'm hoping the new version is better, but I'll let others try it first.

  body: Thanks everybody. All those glowing comments must have been about the (presumably
    not buggy) Mac version. Sounds like patience (while you try out the next version,
    Sharon) or platform conversion is the remedy here.

  body: I think I'll just stick with my $35 Typograf. It has most of the features
    I wanted. (The interface isn't the prettiest.) FontExplorer replaced my system
    fonts with gibberish. I had to guess my way through system restore to fix it.
    EEK!
