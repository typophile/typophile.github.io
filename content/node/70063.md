  they used for Continental (Perpetua -- looks like a custom ultra weight to me) in
  a kind of boring web-safe light blue."

  body: I would tend to agree. But like Jackson said, is probably a stopgap. I think
    Southwest Airlines does a great job with branding. I'm not crazy about the look
    of it, just the consistency, and user-friendly feel.

    the different parts of the plane. '
