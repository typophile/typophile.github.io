    is that I don't have the $$ to buy it.\r\n\r\nOh, and that nine styles might become
    unwieldy. Why not just one style with a lot of Opentype variants?\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

    who just don't do stylistic sets and the work involved is more than making several
    versions. I can understand the choice FB made.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    pal.\r\nNow I'm looking at the sturdy Georgia and thinking, wish I could spruce
    that up.\r\nBut this is a site where users can't get to specify their own choice
    of text face.\r\nPity."
