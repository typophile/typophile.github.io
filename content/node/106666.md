  the font as Lucida and instead chooses Arial if the typeface has the characters?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monte

  body: This is presumably due to RichEdit's font fallback mechanism. I'm guessing
    there is some piece of metadata missing in the Lucida font that RichEdit is looking
    for as an indicator of support for particular Unicode ranges. So eveb though the
    font contains cmap support for the characters you want, RichEdit is switching
    to a fallback that it knows supports them. Yes, 'tis frustrating.

  body: The font switching is something that happens at text input time. You should
    be able to select all the text you have input and apply the font you want, and
    it should work correctly. Also, you should be able to input text in a plain text
    editor and then paste it into WordPad with the font set as you want.
