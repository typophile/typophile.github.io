  the discussions invaluable as I develop my skills as a designer. I am creating my
  first typeface and would like some feedback.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OverEasy_4189.png]\r\n\r\nI
  am new to type design, and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Please,
  do not hold back on your criticism (it's the only way I'll learn).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n~Ezra

  body: "Has a similar feeling to Jos Buivenga's \"Diavlo\".\r\n\r\nAdditional thoughts:
    The flattened bottoms of the letters look too artificial and constrained. Which
    for a font that's supposed to suggest the influence of the hand - it's jarring.I'm
    not sure what you can do to fix that as it seems to be a major structural design
    in your typeface. \r\n\r\nHopefully others will be able to chime in with how you
    might solve this issue."
