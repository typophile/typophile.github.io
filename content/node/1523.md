body: Here&#39;s another one. This time for a water treatment company. They wanted
  a round continuous logotype so I build up this set of letters from the drop form
  used on the a &amp; q. the u &amp; n are again the same, the C and the O are very
  simmilar, but I skewed the top O to match the R ending curvature. The E comes from
  the C cutted and rotated into the center.  <BR> <BR>On the back of the card there
  is the type &#43; logo, a simple water drop. I think I have some conflicts on the
  size of the letters, the tr ligature is of course the exception. <BR> <BR>Thanks
  for your time &amp; feedback again.  <BR>adriano <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/17954.gif"

  body: hm, i think it has legibility issues, in particular the first &#34;a&#34;,
    which kinda looks like a c, and the u that gets lost. I think it would look better
    overall with the letters separated from each other...

  body: i agree with kemie^.  it&#39;s very illegible... if i didn&#39;t read the
    name on the forum title, it would&#39;ve been a chore to figure out what it says.
    <BR>i like the second &#34;a&#34;.  nice style, but the word &#34;centro&#34;
    seems to take on a different style.  i think the first thing to do is make the
    first &#34;a&#34; look like the second &#34;a&#34;.  you&#39;ll probably have
    to separate the letters a little.   <BR>also, the &#34;e&#34; looks out of place.
    <BR>and the &#34;n&#34; maybe should be modeled off of a rotated &#34;a&#34;,
    where the curve doesn&#39;t start out going up, it just goes horizontal, and then
    curves downward.  sorry, its hard to explain. <BR>business card is nice, but logo
    can improve.

  body: Ok, don&#39;t mind the imperfections on the forms, just made some changes
    on several letters and gave more kerning among them. The logo will consist only
    on the type, and the water drop will be included only on the back of the card.
    Tell me what you think on the new E direction, the new C. Thanks. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/18264.gif"

    there to reinforce the &#34;centro&#34; meaning?

  body: Adriano, on the 2nd and 3rd version I do see the u. I&#39;m just being practicle,
    being the average person isn&#39;t a designer and doesn&#39;t have alot of imagination.
    Keep up the good work, just keep thinking of the end user or person who will purchase
    their services.

  body: Adriano , <BR> <BR>I like this concept. I find it clean and fresh and thus
    it&#39;s meeting the expectations one has of a water treatment company. <BR> <BR>Out
    of the three &#34;aquas&#34; you&#39;ve posted on Dec 25, I clearly like the third
    one best &#40;the second one second best; the first one is the least legible&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>The water drop shaped letters are really nice, although you might consider
    making the counters/bowls of the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;q&#34; a tad rounder &#40;red
    circles&#41;. The &#34;ua&#34; &#40;orange circle&#41; might, under certain circumstances,
    need some work in order to not look too heavy &#40;-&#62; ink traps?&#41;. <BR>

  body: Adriano, I like the top one, the bottom one would require you to make the
    whole thing smaller on the card as it is now the o gets cut off by centro. If
    you really want to compare make them match mechanically, ie nothing gets cut off.
    That might help make your decision.

  body: I really like the first of the two logos posted on Jan 2nd, the way the drop
    is offset from the logotype definitely makes it more interesting and more unique
    IMO. <BR> <BR>I think that the &#39;u&#39; appears a little to high though, and
    needs to be lowered -- not the whole character, just make the vertical bars shorter.
    They look a little like they&#39;re towering over the curved tops of the other
    letters. <BR> <BR>Maybe you could try rounding the tops of the &#39;u&#39; bars
    a little, as if there was a curved top to the letter. If that makes sense. It
    might not work but I think it could be worth a go. <BR> <BR>Good work though,
    I really like the identity. <BR> <BR>J.
