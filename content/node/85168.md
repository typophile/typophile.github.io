  in my font management software. Is there a way to separate my fonts into these two
  categories other than manually separating several thousand fonts into two sets?\r\n\r\nIdeally,
  id like to be able to do this with Font Explorer X pro 3.\r\n\r\nAny input is much
  appreciated.\r\n\r\n-nick"

    me maybe 30 minutes. I just went to Classify Fonts>Categories>made custom categories
    and started clicking away. It shouldn't take THAT long. When that was all done
    I created Smart Sets in the left sidebar and it added everything to them. Worked
    wonders.\r\n\r\nThough, if there is a faster way I'd love to know as well."
