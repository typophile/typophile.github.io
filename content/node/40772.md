    has <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dutchfonts/df-ko/\">Ko</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/joebob/doctor-bob/\">DoctorBob</a>,
    which are a bit rougher looking than what you would get using a Rapidograph on
    one of those rulers... (<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/allied-engine/\">Allied
    Engine</a> is also in the same category.)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/isometrik/\">Isometrik</a>
    comes close, but the stencil is different.\r\n\r\nSame goes for <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/crisafulli/\">Crisafulli</a>.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/cargo/\">Cargo</a> is all-caps.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/helio/\">EF Helio</a> comes pretty dang
    close, and has several weights. Some of them look like what you would get with
    a Rapidograph that was too thin for the shapes in the ruler."
