  body: "The conventional wisdom on this sort of thing is that it's almost always
    more effective to spend an hour writing/sketching/drawing by hand with various
    pens, brushes, and markers. You could find some inspirational scripts or logos
    and imitate them.\r\n\r\nIf you simply need to use a font -- not everyone has
    illustrious handwriting -- the single best source of script fonts might be <a
