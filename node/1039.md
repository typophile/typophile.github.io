  to &#40;or so i think&#41; the thinner strokes on <BR>letterforms. Icame across
  the term in an essay by <BR> Stanley Morrison,and have heard the term thrown <BR>
  about in &#39;type&#39; class  without any concrete reason for it&#39;s  <BR>use.
  It occured to me that it may have come about <BR>because they literally look line
  hairlines when printed <BR>at smaller pt sizes.  <BR> <BR>I would love some clarification!  '

  body: kris <BR> <BR>I think a hairline is a hairline at no matter what point size.
    Basically half-a-point, maybe a quarter-point, can&#39;t remember, most likely
    a half. Rule &#40;lines&#41; were cast at a minimum of one-point but the printing
    surface could be much narrower. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve printed cat whiskers. Real cat
    whiskers. Very nice gradation!!! <BR> <BR>Gerald
