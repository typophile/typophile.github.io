body: "More naming issues! I'm generating type one fonts for a family with eight styles.
  These styles are not your standard reg, ital, bold, bold ital etc. They are as follows.\r\n\r\nRegular
  OSF\r\nRegular Tab\r\nItalic\r\nBold\r\nSmallcaps\r\nDisplay Caps\r\nInline Caps\r\nOrnaments\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n1.
  How do I make them show up in this order in the Adobe Apps?\r\n\r\n2. Should I:\r\na)
  make two suitcases of 4 styles each, and mark them reg, ital, bold, bold ital even
  though they are not?\r\nb) Or should I make individual suitcases for each of the
  odd ones (ie smallcaps, ornament, display, inline etc) calling them \"regular\"?
  Does it matter?\r\n\r\n3. Ignoring Dezcom's warning, I try to test with Suitcase
  X1 also. Suitcase is telling me that all the weights are the same font and will
  only activate one style (this is with a 2b settup)?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nRandy"

  body: "Thanks for your reply John.\r\nRe: Ordering in the menu\r\nHelpful info!
    Is there any reason why I shouldn't asign different \"weights\" to the different
    styles even though they are not different weights per se (such as setting the
    ornaments to \"Ultra Black\" to put them at the bottom)?\r\n\r\nRe: Open Type\r\nI
    know that open type is better in so many ways, but I am supplying to a foundry
    that offers T1 Fonts. So I'm stuck with finding a T1 solution.\r\n\r\nWhen making
    a suitcase, FL gives 4 \"locations\" to add styles Reg, Italic, Bold, and Bold
    Italic. You can put as many fonts in each slot as you want. Does it matter where
    you put what? Say I've labeled my ornaments \"Ultra Black\" to get them at the
    bottom of the list, is there any reason I shouldn't stick them in with the regular
    in the regular slot? Should I just chuck them all in the regular slot?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRandy"

    from the fact that lying is a sin? :)  I can' think of a reason off-hand, but
    I would ask Tom Phinney since he'll have a better idea of exactly what Adobe is
    doing in its menus and what the issues might be. Also, I can't remember exactly
    how weight works in Type 1 fonts: in TT and OT, the weight class is set as a number
    value in the OS/2 table, which means you can assign weights that do not correspond
    to style names (very handy for the kind of thing you want to do)."

  body: "Randy, I'm afraid I can't help with your specific question, as I've never
    bothered with trying to get styles to appear in a specific order.\r\n\r\nI've
    always made Type 1 suitcases correspond to retail packages -- that makes sense
    for font management, whether it's being done by distributors or end users. So
    if this typeface will be sold as one package, I would make it one suitcase. \r\n\r\nSuitcase
    contents don't have to be style-linked.\r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\nI have a couple of
    comments about your family.\r\n\r\nFirstly, if you are offering a choice of figure
    styles for the Regular, what is the figure style for the Italic and Bold? Why
    is there no corresponding choice? This is a question that end users would wonder
    upon seeing the menu contents -- they may not have support material such as PDFs
    or printed specimens available which would let them know, and besides, shouldn't
    it be evident from the menu?\r\n\r\nSecondly, your family, which will nonetheless
    provide a lot of \"expert\" typographic functionality, is missing the very basic
    Bold Italic. If this typeface is to be a success in the publishing market (magazines,
    newspapers), for which it seems suited (thanks to gumshoe PH for the tip), then
    a bold italic is very important. The reason is that art directors would then have
    the ability to specify sidebar text as bold face, and keep editors, who wish to
    italicize occasional words according to their style guide, happy. "
