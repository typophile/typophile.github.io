    request for comments got overlooked. I'm replying so the thread gets some attention
    again.\r\n\r\nMy general comment on DRT logo... a little too busy for my taste.\r\nI
    don't understand the shield motif and PLEASE don't use pseudo small caps EVER!\r\n\r\n"

      old habit\u2026 left over from my days  as a package designer, I guess. I'll
      try to rework it to make it simpler.\r\n\r\nReid"

  body: Hmmm, can you clarify your choices for the teal and the grey? I'm not convinced
    yet that the combination is best for transit.

  body: "I agree with Dana about the colors personally although I find that teal is
    more acceptable in the south than it is in the north. Just an observation. I would
    love to know Why you picked these colors.\r\n\r\nIt isn't small caps that Norbert
    has in his gunsights - it's pseudo small caps. Do you know the difference? If
    not, chime in & we will explain. Or seasrch on google.\r\n\r\nI have soft spot
    for public transit. Can you tell us more about the project? What is the current
    logo like? What are you attempting to do with the new logo? What is it meant to
    mean? "

    body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nThe logo was for a contest that was being held in our area.
      I chose the symbol of a crest because I wanted the logo to look somewhat traditional
      and in an Art Deco style. It was to look like a captain's hat for an airline.
      I know this isn't for an airline, but at the same time I wanted the viewer to
      have a sense of comfort in travelling on the transit, hence the crest to show
      stability. The colors were picked mainly because I felt that blue and red with
      grey is overused for transit companies. I wanted something different, more contemporary
      and sophisticated looking.  \r\n\r\nWas I off the mark in this approach?\r\n\r\nReid"

  body: Thanks for the link on what they chose. I can't say I think too much of what
    they picked. It's way to squishy and it lacks conviction. Typical design by commitee
    stuff. Your design had the seed of a good design in it. Keep posting your stuff!
