  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>An article on [[Typographica]] written by Verena Gerlach posed the question <a href="http://typographica.org/2011/on-typography/where-are-the-women-in-typedesign/">&ldquo;Where are the Women in Type Design?&quot;</a> In response Indra Kupferschmid and I started creating a Listgeeks list of <a href="http://listgeeks.com/#!/view/female-typedesigner/by/kupfers">Female typedesigners</a>. (You can also view mine <a href="http://listgeeks.com/#!/view/female-typedesigner/by/Typegirl">here</a>.) After some back and forth it was decided that the list really deserved to be on a wiki and I suggested the <a href="http://typophile.com/wiki">Typowiki</a>. Thus allowing others to add those whom they believe belong on the list.</p>
<p>At first it was a list for those <em>currently</em> practicing as a type designer whether full-time, part-time, or only sometime. But after a large group of people kept suggesting Carol Twombly the list will now include any women who have practiced as a type designer. This list, I think, should not include students or those who simply work at a foundry. They must be—or have been—involved in the type design process (which includes production)</p>
<p>A few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&rsquo;ve always written <em>type designer</em>, but Indra created the list with <em>typedesigner</em>. I wonder which is preferred?</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t think the list should include student type designers. But what do you think?</li>
</ol>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>But there are so many people named John and William&hellip; but Baskerville and Caslon are much less common names. This is a major reason why lists are usually by last name; there is a much greater variety in surnames than in given names, and so the surname lets you proceed more directly to a specific individual.</p>
<p>Also, a given name is sometimes variable. Thus, Ivan Ivanov might also be known as Jean Ivanov in France or John Ivanov in Britain. For a real example, there&rsquo;s Zsuzsa Polgar&hellip; also known as Susan Polgar. Chinese people living in English-speaking countries often use an English given name as well as a Chinese one.</p>
<p>While formality and dignity is no doubt <em>part</em> of the reason people are typically alphabetized by surname, there are good practical cataloguing reasons for doing it that way. Would you <em>really</em> want to have the local public library&rsquo;s catalogue order books by author under the author&rsquo;s first name first?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, my article was the response to Indra’s earlier request for some names for her list. 
Since I’m not sure about the point of these unmodrated lists, I decided to not search for actual (sometimes ancient) names, but more for the reason for what obviously is going wrong in our profession/society. 
I’m quite afraid, that these lists might be mistaken by some people for »proving« the existence of females in the szene, even, they are sometimes already dead or just to be found on these lists. But not in features, articles, juries, on stage (see Typo London 2011, Raabs&hellip;), etc.
Although, it is great to see, that the names on the lists are much more than just the excuse-dingbats-calligraphy-kitty designeresses, people mostly think of, when they say: »but there are women&hellip;«</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Instead of setting some limit on whom to include and where to make the cut-off, maybe the best approach is to do the most comprehensive list possible, then have a simple key of asterisks or lettercodes indicating for each person:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether they are living</li>
<li>whether they have worked professionally as type designers
     <ul><li>if yes, when they last did so ("currently" being a potential answer)</li></ul></li>
<li>whether they have published typefaces credited to their name
     <ul><li>if yes, how many</li></ul></li>
<li>any other variable that is relevant</li>
</ul>
<p>Doing this will not only yield the most comprehensive documentation, but will also provide some clear distinctions without relying on judgements as to what level of accomplishment is more worthy of inclusion or not.</p>
<p>Of course it&rsquo;d be best to do this with a truly dynamic system that could be easily expanded on the fly (e.g. if you wanted to change the key coding system or sort order, automatically generate individual person pages, include font name credits, birth/death years, etc, etc), but this wiki entry is a good start.</p>

The idea of a list came much later after some less fruitful back and forth on twitter. And it isn’t “my” list, actually I’d rather like to stay out of the discussion since I don’t quite concur with most of the points made.</p>
<p>Yes, in a way the list is here to proof that there <strong>are</strong> women working in the field of typeface design, to whatever extend. The question why they don’t speak on conferences is a completely different one (one we shouldn’t discuss in this thread).</p>
<p>Nick’s suggestion to add some commentary is great in my opinion and better than having several overlapping lists.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Verena, I have to say that your essay is highly unconvincing to me - ironically, as if it were written by a man! I expected more rigor, sensitivity, insight and balance. You do make an interesting point about the &ldquo;unfinishability&rdquo; of fonts and how that counters the female psyche (although I don&rsquo;t attribute that entirely to social conditioning). Furthermore, although my direct exposure to German culture is limited, I have had great indirect exposure, and in fact have been regularly impressed with how much respect women get in your country. Here in the US the passing of a <em>vice</em>-presidential <em>candidate</em> from <em>thirty</em> years ago is a big deal because she was a woman!  :-/</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Indra, sorry for putting your name as being involved. I didn&rsquo;t know it was an issue.</p>
<p>Verena, while I think that it is somewhat rude to downplay the work that the, as you put it, &ldquo;excuse-dingbats-calligraphy-kitty designeresses&rdquo; are contributing I don&rsquo;t see what the problem is. This isn&rsquo;t a list of only the cool kids.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m following you why didn&rsquo;t you title your article, &ldquo;Where are all the Women in Type Design who only design the highest quality fonts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some type designers might need the help of others to do the technical side, some might start out that way and graduate into doing most/all of it on there own, some start out right in Fontlab, some can find there way around the FDK, and on and on. So yes, making a list means you can&rsquo;t limit it to just the so-called &ldquo;serious&rdquo; type designers. I&rsquo;m a definitely one to promote strong typefaces. And I&rsquo;ve even said that some typefaces aren&rsquo;t really typefaces but more just digital rub-down lettering—although I was just being a bit of a jerk when I said that. But to NOT make a list just so you can avoid having to share that list with the gamut of female type designers is not right. There are no bad typefaces. Just typefaces appropriate for the job at hand. Sometimes all you need is a cute script for a headline and sometimes you need an full-featured OT workhorse font.</p>
<p>But I think there are too many people trying to keep up appearances. Everyone is here to learn. Everyone can grow and become better. Growth doesn&rsquo;t happen without output and hardwork. Output doesn&rsquo;t happen unless you release something. Sometimes what gets released is simple. But you know what? Sometimes simple is all you need.</p>
<p>And further, why does someone need to be recognized, awarded, public, etc. to prove they are good at what they do?</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;ve misunderstood you. Then I do apologize.</p>

But in terms of the original article, I assumed Verena was speaking generally. I thought a list would be a nice way to recognize the fact that there is a growing list of women at different stages in their careers designing type. So I stand by the list. Maybe some research needs to be done to qualify everyone and adding commentary seems like a good idea. It is a sad day when we avoid making a list just to keep some people off of it.</div>

<p>Not proof, evidence. And it&rsquo;s not (or shouldn&rsquo;t be) an ego thing* - it&rsquo;s just a matter of getting more exposure** so you get more business. For example I submitted my work to the CR Type Annual, and was lucky to be included; it&rsquo;s a nice feeling seeing it out there, but mostly I&rsquo;m concerned with the question of how much more work it will cause me to get. BTW, there&rsquo;s a very good reason to speak at a conference besides exposure: pushing something you believe in, like respect for blackletter type or awareness of Latinization. I think Verena might be focusing too much on the fame aspect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Although if that happens to get somebody up in the morning and do good work, I guess it can&rsquo;t be all that bad!</li>
</ul>
<p>** Not to mention saving money on conference registration fees!  :-)</p>

<p>And music scores need to be typeset as well&hellip; and chess diagrams.</p>
<p>At one point, needing a chess diagram for my web page, and desiring something legible and immediately recognizable, in drawing the symbols for chess pieces, I gave &ldquo;sincere flattery&rdquo; to some unknown (well, unknown to me, and at least <em>unsung</em>) type designer at Linotype:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/opening_4920.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>rather than trying to undertake the daunting task of coming up with a clear and legible original interpretation of the chess pieces.</p>
<p>EDIT: I considered this matter important enough to confess to my sin against some hard-working type designer, but I&rsquo;m feeling less bad now. After doing some web search, I find that Linotype only has a more modernized and stylized form of chess symbols available, PIXymbols chess regular - and the classic styles of chess fonts have instead been digitized and made available by a company called Alpine Electronics - the classic one that also inspired me as Linares.</p>

Regarding number of published typefaces – should be okay to maintain if everybody puts in their own and what they know of. Can be seen as an indicator of activity among the free-lance designer.</div>

<cite>Are you seriously saying there&rsquo;s a shortage of calligraphic Latin text faces?</cite></p>
<p>Perhaps there is a surfeit, as it appears that however many of them may exist, calligraphic faces for the Latin script seem to resolutely remain used as display faces only.</p>
<p>However, it just occurred to me that I was overlooking one exception that someone may actually have used for body copy. If they did, though, I would tend to agree with those who would view it as wildly inappropriate for the context.</p>
<p>AMS Euler.</p>
<p>It may be a beautiful typeface - designed by Herman Zapf himself, so who can doubt - and I can even sympathize with the desires of those involved to find a new, original paradigm for the typesetting of mathematics - but I&rsquo;m afraid it is, to me, at any rate, jarringly not what I am used to.</p>
<p>@typerror:
<cite>look for the origins of Ladoga! Simply wishing to lay the design ethos where it lies as opposed to some usurper.</cite></p>
<p>I had seen the beginning of the description, where it said the face was designed in the Soviet Union in 1968 by Anatoly Shchukin. I hadn&rsquo;t opened up the description to see that Ladoga itself, however, was based on it by someone else in 2010.</p>
<p>Is it Viktor Kharik that you see as the usurper, though, or Anatoly Shchukin - does this face have a still earlier origin?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I see that Anna Simons is included on the list of women type designers. I&rsquo;m a fan of her work, especially the initials and titling lettering she created for the Bremer Presse, of which I own a lovely folio set, but I&rsquo;m not aware that she created any typeface designs. She was a calligrapher and lettering artist, and although she created some letters for use in print editions, she didn&rsquo;t design any full typefaces, to my knowledge. I&rsquo;m not saying that she should not be included on the list, but I am wondering how the criteria apply in a case such as hers? [Her inclusion also makes me wonder about the influential role of women in type design education, and how this might be recorded or acknowledged in the list; among Simons' students was Jakob Erbar.]</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here are some Soviet women type designers or lettering artists included in the &lsquo;big grey book of Soviet typography&rsquo; (<em>The lettering art: work by Moscow book designers, 1959–1974</em>) and not yet included in the wiki list. The situation of &lsquo;type designers&rsquo; in the Soviet Union was complicated by the difficulty of manufacture. Relatively few type designers ever had their designs produced as type, so most worked at drawing &lsquo;type&rsquo; for reproduction in book titling etc. A notable female exception was Galina Andreyevna Bannikova (1901–1972), designer of the Bannikova and Baikonur families. I have little doubt that these designers, if working today, would have been happily producing their own fonts &ndash; in the great Russian font software, of course &ndash;, so I&rsquo;m content to think of them as type designers. The book was published in 1977, so it seems certain that at least one of these women has since died.</p>
