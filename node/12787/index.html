  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">i'll be the first to admit i don't know everything there is to know about type... but i keep finding great faces that seem to exist only in metal or are otherwise unavailable in a quality digital rendring. Just a couple:

[[Oldrich Menhart]]'s Manuscript
[[Hermann Zapf]]'s Civilite
[[Inland Type Foundry]]'s Commercial Script

I think that the Inland Script is public domain by now, but there are most likely restrictions on digitizing the other two (for commercial resale anyway). So my question is, what are some other great faces that have yet to become available generally in digital format?</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Hasn't Manuscript already been digitized? I seem remember some discussion about it a few months ago…

I'm not sure that it would be appropriate to revive a face from a living designer. I also know of a few cases of children of designers who got peeved when their parents' typefaces suddenly appeared out of the blue in digital format (for sale by third parties, sometimes without even proper attribution).

Best bet would be to contact the designer or the family directly, in my opinion. Who knows? Maybe Hermann Zapf is just waiting for the right offer for his Civilite…

It has... but the only "decent" (IMO) digitization of it is <a href="http://www.omnibus.se/engix/lkmanus.html">Franko Luin's version</a> and it seems to be unavailable most likely for copyright reasons. I don't much like <a href ="http://tdc.org/news/2001Results/Manuscript.html">Alex White's version</a>, a bit too gloopy for my taste.

<em>Maybe Hermann Zapf is just waiting for the right offer for his Civilite…</em>
Doesn't [[Linotype Library|Linotype]] have a good working relationship with Zapf? I'd love to see them offer develop this one.

It also includes every character designed for Legende, many of which never made it in. Schneidler is a master on the same level as Koch, Tiemann and Lange, and his fonts deserve wider recognition outside the German-speaking world.</div>

I'd love to have a good digital version of the Imprimerie Nationale's Cypriot typeface, and will probably make one for myself if I can find the time. I think it is one of the most beautiful of all the IN 'exotic' types: some of the forms have the freshness of Matisse papercuts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Dan,

My first real digitization will be some letters by one of the local calligraphers in Atlanta. It will be a display italic with a range of contextual froof. As far as Schneidler goes, I don't know which company ended up with his stuff--either Linotype or Neufville, I suppose. I want to get better at digitizing before I go at something as institutional as a Schneidler face.

		<div class="commentbody">To me, very few old fonts are worth [re]digitizing; the effort is generally better spent on new stuff. But -as always- there are exceptions: Deberny #16 (which I'm actually co-working on, quite slowly though), Pascal (which Neufville has been working on, <strong>forever</strong>...) and Octavian.

John H: You probably mean the 12 point Cypriot (p237 in IN's 1990 specimen book), the one that looks like cave paintings? Because the 10 point (same page) seems like quite a boring monoline; and it seems to have been cut at a later date (and probably by a different hand), since the IN's 1905 specimen book (which I got my hands on recently - it's quite amazing) only shows the 12 (and shows it much better - p102) and the caption says only one size was available. Anyway, if you'd like a 600dpi scan (or 2000dpi photos) from the 1905 just let me know - although I guess chances are good you already own the book!

John B: I'm pretty sure the Schneidler stuff is with Linotype.

		<div class="commentbody">>Well, how about all those typefaces that need REdigitizing?

There is always scope to do a digital version of any metal type, with much leeway for interpretation. First, there is the question of which size(s) one uses for one's master.
Then there is the question of "process", or ink gain: for the model, does one take a clean piece of type (or even the designer's drawings), or a printed image with a lot of gain -- or something in between? Also to be considered: the amount of gain to be expected in printing from the digital type (if indeed print is going to be the final medium). 

And of course, every designer has their own personality to put into a typeface, in both their conceptual attitude, and in their feeling for form, expressed in the particular shape of curves and texture of detail. A physical signature. 

So it's not really a question of faces that NEED re-digitizing, but of what fresh interpretation a type designer today can bring to bear on something from the past.

Having said that, I still side with Hrant in preferring new original work, even though I am quite happy to oblige clients/customers by reworking older designs. C'est la vie.</div>

It's not hard to start a new thread (and it's probably a good idea), and you're of course free to contact me*, but I don't know much more about this. I can however put you in touch with Jacques André. BTW, it seems to me that delving into the design of the RdR might reveal the most about Truchet, and James Mosley's recent book (I forget the title - Dan knows) is probably the best single place to start that journey.

The best one I personally have is in the IN's specimen book of 1905*, which shows the "L" and "M". I can scan/photograph those up for you, if you like. The "G" might be somewhere in my library too, but somebody would have to tell me where to look for it.

I will certainly take you up on your offer. I would need a high res scan suitable for print. I am not sure how large a file that would be, or how to get it to me. (e-mail) I would be happiest to have both the "L" and the "M".

<em>"* Which BTW has [at least] three references to Truchet, but all cursory. Arthur Christian places the credit for the RdR firmly on the shoulders of Jaugeon."</em>

Thank you for this also.

Would you, John or anyone else happen to know who (institute) has a showing of Luce's rococo flowers  (c.1733).

I will try to fiqure out how to start a new thread. Sorry for this.

Hello John, I expect to be in your neck of the woods.

The image is about 9x4.5 inches at 600, so probably more than big enough for your book.

> Luce’s rococo flowers

I don't see any actual samples in my two IN books. On page 84 of the 1990 book however there's a short paragraph about that stuff:

En 1771, Luce publie chez J. Barbou son 'Essai d'une nouvelle typographie ornée de vignettes, fleurons, trophées, filets, cadres et cartels, inventés, dessinés et exécutés par L. Luce, graveur du Roi, pour on Imprimerie royale'. Cette typographie est composée de six mille poinçons gravés de 1740 à 1770, "fruits de quelques loisirs que les travaux de l'Imprimerie royale laissèrent a son auteur".

But are you sure they'd be "rococo"?


--

So what's the book about?

• But are you sure they’d be “rococo”?

According to the late John Dreyfus they are, supported by the old Berthold Typefoundry.

• (“Débuts de l’Imprimerie en France - L’Imprimerie Nationale - L’Hotel de Rohan”, Arthur Christian, L’Imprimerie Nationale, 1905), and me.

Already entered. The scan is beautiful.

• So what’s the book about?

The topic: printer's fleurons. The first text in the book consists of several discoveries and observations by the late John Dreyfus. Naturally Dreyfus wrote this section himself. 

The rest of the text is my own which will be lavishly illustrated by my own work with fleurons.

And yes, there is a publisher waiting.

		<div class="commentbody">Oh God, can one keep nothing private anymore? I suppose I must be the first to have digitized and used Luce's ornaments (which, personally, I would loosely describe as faux gothic) and have used them for a good ten years, but I have sedulously kept them away from the eyes of known typophiles. 

With regard to the digization of old metal typefaces, the problem is laziness on the part of designers. What makes a metal typeface great is not the design per se, but the implementation at the various sizes. Until you are willing to restrict a metal design to one size you cannot get it to rival the printers' work of yore. But this applies to new designs too, doesn't it? Hence Sumner Stone's Cycles in 7, 9, 11 points. </div>
