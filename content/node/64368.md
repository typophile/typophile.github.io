body: "Cheers all my fellow typophiles,\r\n\r\nI'm having trouble finding a suitable
  proxy for this beautiful typeface seen in this attachment.\r\nIt may indeed be custom
  but would any of you be able to recommend a suitable Proxy or Look-a-Like ?\r\nIt
  almost looks like an Ultra Light ITC Tiffany with it's angled terminals - maybe
  an anemic Baskerville ?\r\n\r\nNot sure on this one but would love to have your
  opinion and recommendations on this ! ^_^\r\n\r\nPlease do chime in !\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks in advance !!!\r\n\r\n\r\nlex"

  body: The E, F, A, and P look like something straight off of Times Roman, except
    super thin. That T is throwing me off a little bit...

  body: "I think the shape of the T, C (two serifs), E & F all remind me of Caslon.
    It's as if someone added just enough white stroke to make the letters all but
    disappear. Of course, the font may have been drawn this way. Something seems very
    familiar about this whole question. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thank You All for your helpful insights !\r\n\r\nI agree, it has the feel
    of all those classic faces, Caslon, Times but I've never seen a version so thin.\r\n\r\nMike
    - Thanks for sending the link to Finura - it's definitely close in style...\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone have any other recommendations for a similar typeface ? \r\nWould love
    to hear - THANKS !\r\n\r\n\r\nlex"
