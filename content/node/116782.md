  body: "The closest I can find is <strong>FA Herrick Sign Writers</strong>\r\nThe
    copyright says:\r\n<blockquote>French Alphabets. Designed by F C Herrick for the
    use of the signwriters and letterers at the British  Empire Exhibition, 1923.
    \ (c) Mindofone Fonts. 2011.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAccording to LucDevroy this is
    a free font digitized by Dick Pape:\r\n<blockquote>In 2011-2012, Dick Pape created
    a number of free fonts based on designs pointed out to him by Mindofone, and he
    calls them his Mindofone collection, 86 files strong. They include French Alphabets
    (FA) and French Advertising Alphabets (FAA). The French Advertising Alphabets
    were designed by M. Moullet in Brussels in 1946.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nYou can download
    the font from LucDevroy pages:\r\nhttp://luc.devroye.org/pape/French%20Alphabets/French%20Alphabets-Mindofone/\r\n\r\nCheck
    the image bellow. Not a perfect match (no numerals also) but I think it could
    serve as a good substitute.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Herrick-Sign-Writers_5757.jpg]"

    in the Channel Isles so the fact that the font is French/Belgian would make sense.\r\nShame
    there are no numerals, could you recommend a font I might be able to use or adapt
    as an alternative.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks!\r\n"
