  body: "I think it looks like a downturned 'ear' on the 'g', which does not fit Garamond.
    My guess is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/caslon-old-face/\">Caslon
    Old Face</a>, because of the x-height. In any case, it hinges on the 'g', because
    they are very similar otherwise, as far as these letters go.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
