    off?\r\n\r\nOne thing is quite certain, calling a typeface <em>Times New Roman
    Sans</em> is basically the same thing as calling it Times New <em>Serif</em> Sans,
    which is nonsense. So, Times New Roman Sans is probably Times New Roman without
    serifs, created for testing purposes."

  body: "<em>And what did they do with the spacing?</em>\r\n\r\nThat's a good question.
    But let me tell you that Times New Roman with serifs chopped off, might be a better
    testing medium than Courier. I recently learn that psychologists used to employ
    the latter in their legibility/readability tests. "

  body: "Yes, Courier was the mainstay in legibility testing well into the 80s. The
    main reason is that every typewriter had it! :-/  Or at least something your average
    cognitive psychologist thought was close enough... And it's not much different
    now, with Arial The Ubiquitous And Modern taking over.\r\n\r\nComparing Times
    to \"Times Sans\" to get an idea of whether/how_much serifs help readability is
    certainly much better than the usual buffoonery of comparing Times to \"Arialica\".
    But it's still hard to pull off, because the necessary spacing change when you
    remove the serifs is as critical as it is difficult to nail down. Also, their
    Times Sans probably looks odd, so extra special attention has to be paid to the
    Familiarity factor.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, since we're essentially still babes in
    the woods when it comes to the PROPER testing of typeface readability, the serif/sans
    issue is probably too ambitious. A much better test, although one that  would
    result in gleaning some deep mechanics instead of providing handy canned recommendation,
    would be to gauge the effect of letterspacing. And since Thessaloniki '04, Larson
    has been doing just that. Now if he could just get his subjects deeply immersed...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
