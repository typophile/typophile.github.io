body: Whats the implications or basing a new font on another? For instance I was playing
  with Futura and have manipiulated it to have curved inside corners. As this example
  shows. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Damo1_5682.jpg]

    you are manipulating digital data \u2013 you have to check the font\u2019s EULA
    first, if it allows you to do so in case you intend to distribute this as a new
    font. The latter won\u2019t be possible anyway, because there exist licensing
    rights to this typeface. This would be called a derivative design, but as you
    are just manipulating the existing data one could call it also theft.\r\nPlease
    do a research on Futura first."
