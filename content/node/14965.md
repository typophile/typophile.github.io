  can find something similar on the sans, but it's the serif font I am most desparate
  for.\r\n\r\nIt has details of many serif fonts, but nothing that I have come across
  matches this. I have tried \"whatthefont\" - nothing.\r\n\r\nIs this available in
  a digital format? Can anyone ID either font?"

  body: David - I think you are talking about the same typeface that I know by the
    name of Hollandse. Agfa/MT offers <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=242889"
    target="_blank">two Compugraphic weights</a>, but the only version that heavy,
    I believe, was <a href="http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/hubris.htm" target="_blank">Fontbank's
    Hubris</a> - which was heavier, even, than the heaviest weight of Hollandse -
    Bold.

    to the Alphabet\" pp. 213-4 \u2014 you can see Holland)\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - -
