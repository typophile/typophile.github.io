    specific you want to convey about your services, personality, etc? <BR> <BR>Aloha!

  body: Actually, 515 was the first 3-digit number combination out of a series that
    wasn&#39;t already a registered domain. But maybe I should think of some interesting
    story to tell when people ask. I was prisoner 515 at Alcatraz or that was my squadron
    number in the Air Force. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    5s and 1s. Some of these faces <BR>are script faces, incidentally. Maybe this
    is another direction to go? <BR> <BR>bj

  body: Hmmm... I&#39;D say that with such a cool numeric name it should be mostly
    the figures and nothing else. If possible, even ditch the studio :-D. Just 515.
    It&#39;s a cool number.

  body: Because I&#39;m targeting smaller local business, I didn&#39;t want to get
    too abstract. &#34;studio&#34; is really the only element that hints at what kind
    of company this logo is for. Besides, I&#39;ve already registered studio515.com.<IMG

    <BR> <BR>I did try to emphasize the 515 element in some of the designs. I think
    BJ is right in that the right unique typeface would give these logos more individuality.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m trying to keep it simple and I don&#39;t have a lot of revision time.
    Is there any one design that that stands out above the others? Any problems or
    adjustments that could improve any specific designs? <BR> <BR>Thanks for all the
    feedback.

  body: 'I like the idea of the 515 partially cutout from a background like 1 and
    4. Instead of settling on one concrete design, I&#39;d focus more on choosing/creating
    a distinctive typeface for the text and numerals and using that as the common
    thread in all designs. That way, you can continually alter the background shape/image/what-have-you,
    without changing the distinctiveness of the logo. <BR> <BR>For example, if you
    took the &#34;studio 515&#34; from #4 and made the field in the shape of a red
    fireman&#39;s helmet, it would still be recognizable as your logo. Many companies
    do this when branding product, some even go so far as to change all parts of the
    design but the name itself. <BR> <BR>As for typeface recommendations, I&#39;m
    a sucker for serif small caps. A nice Neoclassical or Lyrical Modernist face,
    with condensed italic numerals and standard-weight small caps for the text would
    look smashing, '
