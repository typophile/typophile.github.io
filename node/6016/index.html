A print broker usually has a small plant but is wired into other printers who have different kinds of presses like letter press and of course silk screen.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hot stamping is another way to decorate plastic. A very good friend of mine runs a hot stamping and plastic fab company. You can reach <a href="http://www.urunlimited.com/" target="_blank"> UR Unlimited</a> best by phone (707 528 8871) since their website doesn't have much information. You want to speak with Gary or Mayumi.  <BR> <BR>My dad helped him build a huge laser for his business and we hire them to hot-stamp our plastic injection-molded pickup covers.  <BR> <BR>I've mentioned in another thread the usefulness of nameplate makers for these unusual requests. These are the guys that regularly diecut and print on plastics, and they are pros. I think there's a danger of a clear business card looking hoaky if it isn't done very well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Daniel, that is great. I wish I could find one that I could trust. I've just found that I would prefer to be there myself and hear the excuses and reasons firsthand. <BR> <BR>For instance, before the press I frequent started doing film in-house I'd output the film myself. The press would often blame the film for being out of register by a dot or so. I would find ways to output/design the job so the film could be smaller. Now, however, they output the film for me and I can simply tease them about their film. I have a wonderful long-standing relationship with the press and feel as if I've learned more from getting dirty at the press (so to speak). <BR> <BR>I've also dealt with some brokers that told me how much they mark up the job and found that to be too much. So I act as the broker for my own design clients keeping the price lower.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, I often work in consort with a print broker bidding on a job. They know there will be at least 3 bids on a print job. By working closely with me they can even give me ideas that will make the job look great but also save my client money. They don't want to piss me off I make them money too! <BR> <BR>Sorry for diverting the subject from Allisons need. In Photoshop users magazine there are lots of short run digital printers throughout the US. My guess is they are in places with cheap facilities (Rent). You might check out one of these sites, but, you probably won't end up doing a press check in a traditional way. They might post a proof online. One site you might check on is CreativePro.</div>
