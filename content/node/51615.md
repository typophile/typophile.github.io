body: "I have extolled the many of virtues of IKEA before, but did you know IKEA has
  a Swedish food market? \r\n\r\nGet your Omega fatty acids from the land of Volvo,
  ABBA, and people with Legoland haircuts. Try the many seafood products IKEA supplies,
  particularly salmon fish\u2014as frozen blocks, or cured and spiced as Gravlax filets,
  even in paste form. This leads me to my little font-in-use discovery:\r\n\r\nAbba
  Seafoods (no relation to the dancing queens) uses FontSmith Albert for their product
  labeling. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abbainatube_6366.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5515-2_6217.330w.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/5515-main_5814.675w.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/53ef9e990b_5385.jpg]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontsmith.com/font_details.php?font_num=1\r\n\r\nhttp://www.abba.se/\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravlax\r\n\r\nYes,
  very fonty, even very healthy, but this Typophiler wound up making a beeline to
  the hotdogs and ice cream anyway.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)\r\n\r\nPS... For Extra Credit:

  body: IKEA also has a lovely luncheonette, and at least the dining area at the one
    in East Palo Alto has a fantastic view of... well, the parking lot. Really! It's
    very nice and the food is more edible than you'd expect for the price.
