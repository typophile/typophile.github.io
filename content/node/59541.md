  project this year - the prep was first semester (Feb to June) and now the execution
  is coming up (July to November).\r\n\r\nSo a few years ago I found out that I had
  some Gypsy ancestry and I thought it might be interesting to base my major research
  topic on the Gypsy (now known as \u2018Roma\u2019) culture as an excuse to learn
  more about the people and discover some of my own cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nI felt
  that not only did it offer a unique starting point to my project; it also made it
  more of a personal statement. Research in my first semester led me in very interesting
  directions \u2013 areas I didn\u2019t really think of exploring and wot-not. From
  this little acorn of an idea I now have this idea of \u2018cultural representation
  through typeface design\u2019 to run with.\r\n\r\nSo where I'm at now is I'm currently
  checking out some good examples where typeface has reflected the culture (Fraktur
  - Nazi Germany // Gill Sans - Early 20th Century England) and seeing how it works,
  what was the background etc and try and pull out some good parallels that run between
  them all that I can use to influence my proposed typeface.\r\n\r\nSo can anyone
  think of some other good examples? - Maybe more contemporary? I thought Gotham by
  Hoefler & Frere-Jones could be a good example of this kind of contemporary American
  zeitgeist we are in now-days, but dunno - just rambling here.\r\n\r\nPlease be kind,
  I'm just a youngin'"

    could address it more directly: a typeface suited to the Romani language.\r\nIn
    the manner that, for instance, Peter Bi\u013Eak's types accomodate Slovakian,
    with its profusion of accents.\r\nOr you could make it decorative, using graphic
    themes from Romani art: there was a thread here last year or the year before,
    about type and Maori culture, with some type along those lines.\r\nOr you could
    transpose data that relates to the Roma directly into type forms, that would be
    the most contemporary approach."

    things that cannot be taken from the dispossessed. That and food. I don't know
    if there's a connection there for you but I highly recommend checking out some
    Roma music. The music of the downtrodden is almost always the best.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "Touch\xE9 with the Saab call Nick. I like your three ideas - especially the
    one suited to the language, that could prove to be an interesting approach. Thing
    is - this is just half of my final project; the other half is part of the International
    Society of Typographic Designers (ISTD) brief which set up parameters that I felt
    could help me present the Roma in an authentic // balanced // interesting way.
    ISTD brief is to publish under the title '10 things you should know about...'
    using one of the following 10 categories:\r\n\r\nScience // Sport // Hobbies/Crafts
    // Gardening // Famous battles // Games // Travel // Plays // Artists // Authors.\r\n\r\nI'm
    choosing Travel. My tutors said it's a pretty broad requirement and i can basically
    twist it to 10 things you should know about Ethnic Minorities, or Ethnic Groups
    of Europe or something along those lines.\r\nThe main aim for this book (aside
    from the 10 things) is to show the way typography can be used to create an interesting
    visual publication.\r\n\r\nSo one part type design that is to be used in this
    second part - the book I'm going to design too. At this stage I imagine it's going
    to be a standard alphabet but adding characters that are key to Romani language
    could be an interesting twist, enough to start on at least. I've been checking
    out the music aspect as much as you can from a tiny island in the south pacific.
    All very inspiring comments so far by the way. Thanks so much for helping me narrow
    the field down.\r\n\r\nOh and I'm not fully certain Paul - but I believe my Grandmother
    said Hungarian Roma? Im about 90% sure."

    to India and there are still Roma there.\r\n\r\nAndo Drom would be a good place
    to start. They honor the tradition well. They also have a cimbalon player, which
    is an amazingly beautiful instrument.\r\n\r\nThere's a video documentary called
    \"Gypsy Caravan: when the Road Bends\". It is really great and a good introduction
    to Roma music. No Hungarian musicians if I remember correctly but some great music
    and a look at how some Romanian Roma live.\r\n\r\nThere's another one called \"Latcho
    Drom\" that is also fantastic. I believe that has some Hungarian musicians although
    I can't quite remember.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'The Romany are very mixed racially and tend to be nomadic. Maybe you could
    investigate the cloth signpainters'' sample books that traveling signpainters
    would carry to show customers when they arrived in "your town". I think this was
    a common custom in the 19th century in France, maybe it was more widespread and
    if so, there might be some Romany signpainters out there. The lettering styles
    are very decorative and seem also to fit into the visual culture of the circus.
    More nomadic connections there. '

    Road Bends - found it very enlightening - a very broad perspective of the Roma.
    Again, cheers for the response - It''s all been very very helpful. Right now I
    guess I''m just listing characteristics of the Roma//Gypsies that I''ve discovered
    so far and seeing what I can then carry through and translate to a typographic
    element. It''s truing out to be a lot of fun any who'

    you mentioned, what a touching funeral. Where the Road Bends is fabuous - I have
    it on Tivo at home and watch it every once in a while. Latcho Drom is the story
    of the Roma told completely in music - starting in India and continuing on through
    the hot jazz clubs etc. It is a beautiful movie but I have never seen it on DVD,
    just video.\r\n\r\nDrom means road I believe, something the Roma know well.\r\n\r\nThere's
    also a Spanish movie called Vengo which is set in the south of Spain amongst Roma
    flamenco musicians. It's fictional but there is some great music in it.\r\n\r\nCheers
    to the Romani!\r\n\r\npbc"
