It&#39;s kind of fun to watch, too -- with a sort of &#34;fritzing-out neon&#34; feel to the sparking pixels. <BR> <BR>If, as Joe asked, this is an original outline as well, I certainly think you should complete the static version of it as well as the animated version. <BR> <BR>Would it be possible to see a full character set any time soon? <BR> <BR>David </div>

		<div class="commentbody"> Synapse 1.0 : a brief description <BR> <BR>The origins of creating type has traditionally been predicated by a reader engaging type as a static experience. With the relatively new accessibility of interactive media, I believe it is time for both typographer and reader to re-examine how type is created and engaged. Typography can no longer be viewed as a static event, bound by the pages of a book. Each letterform now has the potential to be an event within itself. A universe of activity could reside in the single letter &#34;a&#34;. <BR> <BR>Synapse 1.0 is an experiment in time-based typography. It is a hybrid of the biological and the technological - an organism of undulating modules. Shapes rhythmically coalesce into familiar and abstracted letterforms. Beyond a statistical improbability, a reader will never experience the same letter &#34;a&#34; twice. <BR> <BR>Synapse 1.0 is an entirely original design inspired by various sources including Herbert Bayer&#39;s type designs, bitmap typography, and the destination signage on San Francisco&#39;s public transportation trains. I hope this typeface inspires conversation and debate. All comments are welcomed. <BR> <BR>The entire set for Synapse 1.0 is nearly complete. Uppercase, lowercase and numbering are ready for critique. These will be posted in the near future. Finally, I would like to thank Joe Pemberton for his assistance in posting this file.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>-RM </div>

		<div class="commentbody">You sure do like hyping yourself up. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be interested in seeing the ActionScript behind this animation. Are you simply triggering movie clips randomly to flash the segments of the fonts, or is there method behind the sequencing? <BR> <BR>Being as it is called synaptic, I&#39;d like to see a variant where the fluctuations are nerve-like responses to stimuli. <BR> <BR>Another avenue of exploration would be to really change the structure of the letters. Instead of just alpha-ing out segments of your letterform, what about designing a series of letterforms and utilising alternative segments to construct letters which are truly original each time. Even going so far as to breakdown each letter into a series of components - ascenders, descenders etc -and then construct each letter from random selections of each required component &#40;This WOULD get messy, but hey, you wanted abstract&#41;. <BR>Even calling upon the powers of Flashes drawing API to draw completely original shapes for each component every time - randomised within constraints. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m just not sure at the moment that your really breaking new ground here yet. For &#39;time-based typography&#39; we could just as easily read &#39;animated logo&#39;.</div>
