  handdrawn illustration that he want to use as a \"logo\" in the banner area.\r\nI
  am having a little hard time to find out wich font to use with it. If I am not completely
  wrong I need to use somekind of handwritten font, right?\r\nI want to position the
  text under or to the right of the illustration.\r\n\r\nHere's the illustration:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/illu_3827.png]\r\n\r\nHelp
  is much appreciated!"
