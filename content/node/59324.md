  I'm working on a logo proposal for a debate club I'm a member of. The bottom line
  reads \"Debate Club of the University of Latvia\". The speech bubbles point in opposing
  directions and represent a debate having two sides. It's a pretty simple \"riddle\"
  and speech bubbles are overused in design, but I think their use is justified here.
  I'd be very pleased to hear more critiques of this logo, since it hasn't been accepted
  by all members of our club yet, and I'm looking for possible improvements."

  body: I like the idea. I think the bottom 2 work best, since they can be dressed
    up with color, yet are still able to be reproduced in 1 color. The full name underneath
    reads quite small to me, but it looks like it will be difficult to go any larger
    without using another line. I'll think about it and let you know if there's anything
    else that could be improved. Thanks for sharing.

  body: "Thanks. The idea is that the black-and-white versions could be used interchangeably
    with any of the other ones if the media required having only a single color.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    yeah, the readibility of the lower part is pretty poor, but having more rows or
    spacing the letters \"LUDK\" out is even worse."

    option is my favourite because each colour has a different value.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "Well, number 5 is looking a bit tacky, to me, along with three and two, because
    of the use of contours\u2026 just feels amateur-like. I'd definitely go with number
    one. If people can't agree on the colours \u2013 which I think work out just fine,
    actually, and I'm always partial towards black and white \u2013, you can always
    change those, but I think it'll work out best in the end. Oh, and I'd push the
    K just a tiny little bit closer to the D, or maybe pull the D towards the K and
    away from the U just a bit, too. Or maybe just pull D and K together away from
    the U. Kerning is always a hit and miss thing, right?\r\nOne other thing I would
    try is using small-caps instead of regular caps; these look a bit too tall and
    caps really weren't made to be used together. They make it harder to read, I think,
    and look a bit disproportionate.\r\n\r\nAbout \u201CVIDEO\u201D; you probably
    shouldn't space it out like that, although it does make it reminiscent of other
    logos for video stuff. The whole logo for video looks classic (or \u201Cold\u201D),
    so if that's not what you're going for you might want to change it.\r\n\r\nSo
    all in all, I think you're definitely on the right track with number one.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the text below\u2026 that's a tough one. You might want to try putting it in front
    of the logo, you know, bigger, in two lines or even in four lines, since the right
    part of the K is leaving some white space open which could be seen as unbalancing
    for the whole thing."

    being said, I find the ones with overlapping strokes a bit confusing and my eye
    prefers #1 although the beige is a bit blah. Just my opinion though. Concept is
    great!"

  body: "Thanks for all the nice comments. Here are two more color palettes that seem
    to be usable:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ludk_salad_n_green_6109.png]\r\nI've
    given up on having the bottom line in color, because it can't be made consistent
    between dark and light backgrounds. The beige is replaced with toxic green to
    address the contrast issue mentioned by Lex. It fixes that, but brings in a new
    set of connotations that I'm not sure are desirable, because there's the three
    primary colors that are being mixed. It would suit something print or graphic
    design related, but not a debate club. Other than that, it looks like the majority
    disagrees with epsilicon about the color combinations being too odd.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be nice if I could make the type for the bottom line larger, because then
    I could get rid of my last reservations about this design, but the none of the
    solutions I've tried work out. I mean stuff like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ludk_centertest_4488.png]\r\n\r\nIt
    \"sort of\" works, but doesn't.\r\n\r\n<em>I wonder if the typeface is a little
    simplistic for a debate club, which I imagine would involve lively, interesting
    meetings.</em>\r\n\r\nGothic typefaces like that seem just neutral to me. In any
    case, I've tried other styles and the result was too jarring. You would have a
    good point if the \"D\" wasn't modified, though.\r\n\r\n<em>Just one question
    - have you thought about making the \u201Cpoint\u201D coming\r\noff the \u201CD\u201D
    larger?</em>\r\n\r\nIt used to be larger, but I shrinked it to make space for
    the bottom line. If it's enlarged, it doesn't translate into being more consistent
    anyway, more like the opposite.\r\n\r\nIn any case, thanks for all the feedback."

  body: The green/red/blue combo is very nice. The Green is a great choice. What if
    you just took the last sample on the black background and left-justified the whole
    thing? I think keeping the font all the same size for Latvijas Universitates Debasu
    klubs is ideal. Maybe make it white too. Just some thoughts. :-)

    a little off. That said there is probably nothing more subjective that color.
    Your choice seems random, what about using the Latvian flag colors or does your
    university have special colors?\r\n\r\nHave you tried keeping the D the same color
    as LUK?  \r\n\r\nThe tag line works best as one line. Since it's so small did
    you consider using roman rather than ital?"
