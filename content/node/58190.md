body: "I'm adding some fairly elaborate swash characters to the font I'm working on.
  These work contextually. One version of the ll combination overhangs the character
  before and after. Not a problem for \"jello\" but it is for \"millipede.\" What
  I've done is to sub i before and after with dotlessi, and the terminals of the swashes
  indicate the dots. But now I'm wondering what to do with \xEEll\xE9m and so forth.
  It seems a bit culturally insensitive and possibly confusing meaning to convert
  these to \"dotlessi\" and \"e\". Obviously I can ignore sub these, but the swashitude
  of the font would be severely reduced in say czech. Any advice, or examples of how
  this has been handled well?"

    which heavy use of swash letters is impeded by heavy use of diacritic marks. The
    diacritic marks take precedence over the swashes, because they are linguistically
    significant."

  body: Thanks guys. I'll spend some time today to see if I can't come up with a swash
    form that would work without scrunching, squashing or complete decapitation. Perhaps
    one that operates "above the cloud deck."
