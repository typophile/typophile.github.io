body: "I am designing a magazine and I am looking for a text font. I will need to
  squeeze a lot of text. I have been testing a few ... but sizes and leading are getting
  really small: \r\nArno (10/11), Diverda Serif 9/11, Leitura news 8/11. \r\nIt seems
  that at that point sizes fonts are losing their identity.\r\nSo ... I was thinking
  of trying a bit taller/narrower body text font. \r\nI would be thankful, if you
  could post some suggestions ... classic or contemporary - both are welcome!\r\n"

    narrowness isn't necessarily more economical.\r\nPlease do a Find on \"economy\"

  body: "I just checked out Dan's Malabar yesterday for a newspaper design. It has
    a quite some \"identity\" and a big appearing size. Though not a narrow design,
    it can easily be set a point size smaller, like 8,5 or even 8 pt for comfortable
    reading text. \r\nOr what about Freight?"
