  size in FontLab but I can't find it!\r\n\r\nLet's say I wanted to make a circle
  or a square 100 units wide and high. How do I do that!?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nAmy"

    I never used \"Primitives\". I'm glad that the name has changed to something better."

    but I guess when I am working at midnight, things tend to disappear off the menus!
    :)\r\n\r\nThanks again."

    It had nothing to do with the name.  Smart Shapes is no better or worse a name."
