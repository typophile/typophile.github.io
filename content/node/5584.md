body: I just found this forum and boy am I lovin it. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the
  only branding nut out there. I will probably utilize this board some as I am kinda
  an island to myself at my job and don&#39;t really get much extra creative input.
  Anyway - here is one that I just wrapped up - I just want to get some feedback on
  it. <BR> <BR>The company sells a couple of very specific software suites &#40;ComputerEase
  - an accounting software and LaserFiche - a document management software&#41; does
  networking, and sells some hardware. They came with more of a blaze orange color
  in their design history and a logo that was pretty dated. <BR> <BR>I wanted to subtly
  enforce the idea of a computer screen through the shapes in that particular font.  I
  also wanted the logo to show support and partnership &#40;the m and v were a bonus&#41;
  as they move into a consultancy role. We also use that shape repetitively on some
  pieces as a pattern &#40;see folder&#41; and some broad solids of the orange and
  blue. <BR> <BR>Looking forward to comments/criticisms/snide remarks etc... <BR>
  <BR>I will try and post some of the other items later that go with this identity

  body: excellent. <BR> <BR>love the fact that the icon is made up of the &#34;m&#34;
    and &#34;v&#34; and the subtle hint of the computer screen is great. <BR> <BR>nothing
    to critique really as it is a finished piece . . .although nothing i could think
    of would improve this logo...well, except the logo by itself that you posted looks
    as though you have centered the icon above the &#34;ov&#34; &#40;where the two
    words join&#41;. i am not sure this works for me, it looks unbalanced. the logo
    works great the two ways you have it formatted on the folder &#40;that is what
    it is, yes?&#41; <BR> <BR>anyway. great job. i look forward to seeing more of
    your work and getting feedback from you as well with posts. welcome to the forum.
