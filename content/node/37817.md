    looks passable"

  body: The lines aren't aligned to a baseline grid?! In the right columne, after
    the empty line, the lines become slightly higher.

  body: Also I don't understand why the caption of the lead picture is using a different
    style than the caption of the in-text picture, and why the in-text picture needs
    a thin black frame (and why this frame doesn't include the bottom side adjacent
    to the caption block).

  body: "I second all points taken by henrypijames and chiefdzp,\r\nand there are
    many more questions that comes to mind in this layout IMO:\r\n- Why have you used
    2 different blues in title, captions and lead (intro)? They are quite similar
    yet different (1) C=100 M=Y Y=0 K=0 (2) C=70 M=20 Y=0 K=24? Keep one color.\r\n-
    Why there are 4 typefaces used - I think its too much for such project. Get rid
    at least of Trajan - it doesn't match to anything in there.\r\n- Lead(intro) is
    too weak, shouldn't be aligned to center, it would be better if it wasn't set
    in small caps and its width would be better if set to equal 2 colums.\r\n- Subhead
    (\"Obe\u0107ana i specijalizirana kirurgija\") is too weak.\r\n- I wouldn't indent
    first line after subheads and in the beginning of the article.\r\n- Consider using
    a drop cap in the beginning.\r\n- Margins are too small, especially inside one
    might cause the text in inside column extreme fall into the spine.\r\n- The layout
    lacks any idea behind it.\r\n- Some paragraphs in body are set aligned to center?\r\n-
    I would suggest you to align body justify, and all other elements to the left
    (ragged)\r\n- I've got impression the leading of the title is too large in comparison
    to other elements.\r\n\r\nI would suggest you to start again from scratch - answering
    some questions on that layout: eg. who would be a reader of it, should the magazine
    look modern, aggressive or maybe calm and balanced, etc. If you find your answers
    look through magazines similar to your needs, you'll find out how other designers
    solved their problems - it might help you, \r\n\r\ngood luck,\r\nAntoni\r\n\r\n"

  body: I agree with everything Antoni's said -- except dropped cap, which I think
    modern page layout can go without just fine.
