  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently the only in-house graphic designer at T-Metrics, Inc., a small telecommunications software company. This summer they want me to re-design their entire identity. At first they refused to let me touch the logo, in fear of losing connection with the loyal customer base they&rsquo;ve had for the 15 years it has been in use. But I wrote a 4 page document explaining why they should change their logo to better compete in the contemporary market. After all, they are a software company&hellip;they shouldn&rsquo;t look dated.</p>
<p>So now they are open to the idea, but understandably, they don&rsquo;t want their customers to have to re-learn the mark entirely. So I need to keep some elements of the existing logo that are worth working with. It currently has a gradient motion trail or something like that, which I would just love to drop altogether. The interaction between the T and M letters seem to be it&rsquo;s strongest point&hellip;to me.</p>
<p>My first shot at this simplifies the mark, while hopefully keeping the letters recognizable. What I currently have seems to work a bit, but overall I think it looks a little stocky and not quite as elegant as I would like it to be. Some embellishment would probably help. The type in the new logo is Myriad, but that will change as soon as I bring my fonts over from my other computer&hellip;I think keeping it thin though will give it a more contemporary look.</p>
<p>What do you guys like about the old logo? Any direction?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help&hellip;glad to be on Typophile!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">A couple of points you are right to want to get rid of the gradient. Just pointing out the production problems in print applications should of convinced your in-house client. My problems with your first attempts at a TM combination is I don&rsquo;t see the M. I think most of your clients aren&rsquo;t designers and won&rsquo;t get it. Try this keep your original idea, and make two more that are more and more obvious TM combination and test the 3 versions with an informal focus group of clients. This way you will get feedback so you aren&rsquo;t working in alone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the direction of the bottom slabs version, however the centre of the M needs to move to the left to centre between the stems. I wonder if putting the diagonal seperator in the opposite direction would remedy the concerns expressed above. The title is causing a problem with its alignment, trying another position, like to the left or above might solve it.

<p>I just added another image to the top post up there ^, curve.gif. To make the logo a little less harsh I turned the division between the letters into a curve. I think it does something to make the M more apparent, because instead of acting as two different pieces they look like they fit like a puzzle. But now I&rsquo;m wandering it the first part looks like a T, or just an ugly odd arm on the M. What do you think? does the curve help?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The curve most decidedly does not help. For starters, the two curves (between the letters) don&rsquo;t match, and beyond that it makes the right half look even less like an M. I think the slab variant you were playing with above is the best so far.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Even the new version looks forced. Don&rsquo;t become so lock stepped with what they did in the past. It just looks dated. Try a different direction, my thought is TM like a Trade Mark. I would add the line under it: A Telecommunications Software Company. Just a thought. But before you get deep into the logo redesign, you have to have feed back and not just from designers.</div>

<p>Spot the student with too much time on his hands! It might not read much better but there&rsquo;s certainly more ways to combine the letterforms. Other than that I agree with Dan- apart from the Trade Mark idea! ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Not sure if this is still being worked on, but I prefer the &lsquo;1&rsquo; version over all of the others. Perhaps making the gap between the two forms thinner will help the &lsquo;M&rsquo; read more quickly. Also, get rid of the Myriad as soon as possible. A geometric, constructivist sans would be more harmonious with the logo than something with the relatively humanist and consistently modulated strokes of Myriad.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the slab serifs. They don&rsquo;t feel contemporary or clean enough for a telcom software company. Unless they&rsquo;re going for something heavier, with a construction feel to it.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">It seems a healthy start, but I would try to push it a bit more.If alerted and properly marketed to, your existing customer base will follow right along. You have to ask - would we lose any customers that we currently have if our logo was different versus, would we gain any customers if our logo was better/clearer? Imgine most of your current customer&rsquo;s reaction. We honestly delude ourselves somewhat thinking that our current customers lie awake thinking about our logos. For the vast majority - if it is relatively simple and clear - their thoughts willbe &ldquo;it is what it is.&rdquo; Those that caputer the new look will more than likely be excited by it. A small few won&rsquo;t like it - regardless. There are just some people who no matter what you change they won&rsquo;t accept it and they tend to like to make phone calls and send emails. I don&rsquo;t think many companies have gone belly up because of a bad logo design if the rest of teh company was working. What you do have to worry about is capturing new market share. That&rsquo;s when the logo becomes your ambassador. Then you have to ask how do new customers and potential customers see us. and Will a new logo help that. Having worked on several rebranding projects and a few renaming ones, I have found that dedication and excitement of the company are key elements to a rebranding&rsquo;s success. If they support it and make a big deal out of it - it will have a great chance of success. I don&rsquo;t think that rebranding is always something you want to try and &ldquo;sneak&rdquo; by your customers. Sure we all get the jitters for trying something different, but sometimes it is necessary. I would maybe keep a couple that are close like you are,but try a few that are slightly more radical departures (just keep it within the same vein versus an updated retelling of the same logo). OK I know that wandered a bit,but you get hat I am saying - good start - try something a little further out.</div>
