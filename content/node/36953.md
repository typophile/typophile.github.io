  design were, and now, at the beginning of my senior in high school I've decided
  to study communication design. What I really want to do is design newspapers, magazines,
  books and other printed matter, so I asked you all this- What are the best schools
  to look at to study this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nI've read about several places so
  far, ideally I am looking for a place that would allow me to submit a largely digital
  portfolio, since my drawing skills are not incredibly great and most schools are
  looking for a very rounded artist-type. I have some sketches, mostly building designs
  and observational drawings from when I was going for architecture, but a large amount
  of digital work I have done for school things and \"for pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nIdeas,
  thoughts, comments?"

- body: "\r\nI got a shockingly great education in \"Multimedia Graphic Design\" at
    Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont (which, BTW, is an amazing place to live.)
    Champlain is a small school that has grown A LOT in the last 10 years and has
    extraordinary facilities. \r\n\r\nOne of my professors had taught at RISD for
    17 years before moving up to VT, and another professor was the stuff of movies.
    \ So talented, so involved, and so in love with design. Champlain gave me a lot
    more than I expected. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.champlain.edu\r\n\r\ngood luck!"

    stage, but you should keep in mind that the best programmes at postgraduate level
    in the field you are interested in are the [[http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/home.html?courses/postgraduate/info_des.html|MA
    Information Design]] and [[http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/home.html?courses/postgraduate/pub_book.html|
    MA Book Design]] at the University of Reading. \r\n\r\nSome images of student

    typography studying and later teaching alongside Stephen Banham whilst at RMIT
    (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) They also have a practical studio year
    (extra year) for exceptional students which was a great way of smoothing the transistion
    into the workforce.\r\n\r\nTo see some of Stephen's work check out\r\nhttp://www.letterbox.net.au/"

    the only ones I know of that have decent reputations are [[California College
    of the Arts]] in San Francisco and [[Art Center College of Design]] in Pasadena.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a list of schools in the TypoWiki:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/12011?\r\n\r\nMy
    personal advice is that if you are looking for the best, look well beyond your
    surroundings :)"

  body: Endre, I'm doing the course you're talking about! I'm in 3rd year, Communication
    Design. Stephen Banham gave us weekly lectures on typography in 2nd year. There
    are also electives in typography and publication. The typography elective covers
    newspaper design, information design, etc. The publication elective involves creating
    a 64-page book and we get taught how to bind it ourselves.
