  for web design/project management that can handle multiple users on a team.\r\n\r\nI've
  heard about Basecamp, and I was wondering if anyone in design/web development has
  used this application before. \r\n\r\nAre there any other project management solutions
  that have group login such as Basecamp out there that would better solve my problem?\r\n\r\nBasecamp:
  http://www.basecamphq.com/\r\n\r\nThank you for any suggestions you might have,\r\n\r\nAdam

    with it is uploading some files and checking images others post, but I seems like
    a pretty complete project management package. From what I've seen of it, I'd recommend
    it.\r\n\r\nI also use Google groups, which has everything I would normally need
    to collaborate with others on line.\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    as a course convenor. \r\n\r\nI've found it to be great for pulling together groups
    because it is very easy to use and orientation/learning happens through actual
    use, which helps speed up the start up stage. \r\n\r\nEvery group I've shared
    it with ends up using it in their own way. I usually make some suggestions at
    the start and then it beds in as the project rolls on."

    <strong>ProjectPier</strong>, which is also open source and quite good, but doesn't
    seem to be under active development: [[http://projectpier.org/]]\r\n\r\n-->And
    a third one, commercial, but probably the most complete of the three so far, is
    <strong>activeCollab</strong>: [[http://www.activecollab.com/]]"
