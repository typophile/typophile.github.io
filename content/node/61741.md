    to the relevant website and find a pdf like <a href=\"http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/media/pdfs/investors/2005/2005_LTSB_Group_R&A.pdf\">this
    one</a>.\r\n\r\nOpen it up in full Acrobat and it'll tell in properties what the
    corporate/house font is.\r\n\r\nHaven't got full acrobat on the PC I'm working
    on so you'll have to do it yourself."

  body: I was thinking the Sans too Stephen, but thought the "S" looked off. Also
    similar to http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/ Foundry Sans. But Jan is right about
    the crossbar on the "e".

  body: "I checked the PDF posted for the one on the left and it is indeed \"New Gothic
    BT Bold\" and \"News Gothic BT Light\".\r\n\r\nFor the one on the right...\r\n\r\nThe
    \"Q\" is way off which leads me to believe it's not \"TheSans\".\r\n\r\nIf I had
    to guess I'd bet it was <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/myriad_pro_virtual/\">Myriad
    Pro</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/myriad_semi_condensed_pro_virtual/\">Myriad
    Pro Semi Condensed</a>.\r\n\r\nThe letters and numbers match and the \"Q\" is
    much better. However, still something isn't right with the \"e\"... maybe they
    customized that one letter?"
