<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I could use any suggestions, comments, etc. about this logo, for a startup airline.
Also, if anybody has any ideas for an airline name, that would be appreciated too. Thanks.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>I dont want to sound too harsh, but.:</em> So what you basically did yet is set two words, using pretty 'standard', common typefaces <em>( Like Helvetica, News or Trade Gothic )</em>.? I am not too sure about that being very unique, or memorable, what about you.? This could be for everything.. You could have tried to slightly customize / modify these typefaces.. But, I think you may want to return to sketching and scribbling various ideas on paper ( again ), instead of starting out with setting type on screen..
What may help you as well is seeing what other airlines did, and what their logos look like.:
<em>> <a href=http://www.aerosite.net/logos.htm target=_blank>www.aerosite.net/logos.htm</a> ( Airline Logos )</em>
<em>> <a href=http://www.af.mil/library/symbol/ target=_blank>www.af.mil/library/symbol/</a> :)</em>
<em>( Is this for a school / university project, Or do you actually have the opportunity to find a new name and create a new brand for an airline.? )</em></div>

<div class=commentbody>If this is real, that's a tall order you're asking free advice on.
A startup airline company with no name? It's not a logo that needs to be done, but an entire branding campaign.
I think you need to answer formlos' question before getting advice.

Yes, I'm old, but I'm being re-branded!</div>

<div class=commentbody>I rarely venture into critique of type <strong>usage</strong>, but...
1) That lc "a" is not "standard", it's Barbarella. Try something like Kievit* instead.
2) For the "airways" I think all-caps is good, but something smaller, wider, looser and darker.
3) For a logo, what about a pennant shape? Since "standard" also means flag, and the pennant is associated with wind.
4) Yeah, totally nail down the name first! :-/ Not to mention the target clientele, etc.

Oh, and don't forget the free peanuts if you use any of our ideas.

<div class=commentbody>I'm guessing this is some type of school project?
If not, you may wish to take a few steps back (like as far as the starting line).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Branding an airline is one of the most difficult tasks for a designer. Mostly it's a team of designers who work on the first ideas for weeks. Designing every single unit, from badges to counters, from wingtips to guidebooks, that's a very intense job which takes months, even years.
There are examples of very basic low-budget airliners (Easy Jet, Ryanair...), but still they are very clever designs, using very common type like Cooper or Helvetica Extended, and it works. You don't want a low-budget liner looking too fancy.
Anyway, good luck with it...</div>

<div class=commentbody>First thing I agree with Kyle this looks like a school project. If you intend to use the logo as signage think of a stop sign. It is knocked out type from a bright solid color. There is a reason for this, its because its visible from a far distance. The same think but opposite for a yeild sign (black type against a bright yellow background). In both cases the type has to be bold to be seen at a distance. Airline, distance get it, the thin type doesn't work. </div>
