  body: "Well, this forum is asking for it. Why would you place the General Discussion
    and Design sections at the top of the page and the ID section way at the bottom?
    What person who isn't on Typophile frequently is going to know that? Who is going
    to assume there is a separate ID section at all when one of the first links they
    click is not only called 'Design' but has several posts where people ask for IDs?
    I would just assume I'm asking for a font ID in the right section if I were to
    post it in the Design section.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but at the very bottom of
    the page is a link to the old ID section. I just had a look and I never even saw
    the new ID section before. Are people meant to access that section by going to
    the first thread of the old ID section? Why do you make it so difficult for people
    to get their font identified? It should be clear where ID requests should be posted
    but it just isn't.\r\n\r\nAlso, deleting messages instantly without notice is
    only going to cause more confusion. Not only do newcomers not know where the ID
    section is or if there is a separate section for font IDs at all, but if their
    posts also get deleted immediately without any explanation as to why, what are
    they left to think? Why all the complaints about people posting font IDs in the
    wrong section when it's obvious the current system just isn't working?\r\n\r\nAnd
    lastly, the General Discussion section has the description \"All topics are welcome\u2014except
    font ID requests.\" underneath. I think this may subtly hint at the Design section
    being the right section for it. Why not add \"Scroll down to the ID section\"
    if you don't want to change the order of the sections and properly link to the
    new ID section?\r\n\r\nNB: I'm not talking to anyone in particular. I'm using
    \"you\" in a general sense."

  body: "Good points Martin. Font ID requests are far more numerous than any other
    category at Typophile. \r\nOne way to direct newbie requestors to the right location
    would be to move the \"Font ID\" forum to the top of the list and move \"Forums\"
    to second place and rename it \"Other Forums.\" But some might see this as the
    tail wagging the dog.\r\nAs for the old Font ID forum, perhaps it could be dealt
    with by deleting any reference to it from all categories except the present Font
    ID forum --  where it could appear as an inconspicuous footnote to the effect
    that \"Font ID requests before 2013 are archived in ...\"\r\nDon"

    bottom is labelled \"OLD\".   \r\n\r\nWe've seen that the current approach isn't
    work well, the problem will continue until more prominent instructions for newcomers
    is placed at the top."
