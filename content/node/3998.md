  the experts, from me, the scratch beginner... <BR> <BR>I know that TypeTool&#40;v2&#41;
  provides several Unicode opportunities in several different languages, but, can
  I create a grid that is compliant with Unicode for a particular character set that
  is not listed in TypeTool&#39;s Unicode drop-down?  For example, the Unicode website
  gives the code assignments for a script called &#34;Khmer Lunar Date Symbols&#34;--if
  I wanted to design a typeface for this script, or let&#39;s say just one of its
  characters, &#34;Pram Roc&#34; &#40;Unicode #19F5&#41;, can I assemble the Unicode-compliant
  grid &#40;table&#41; for this script in TypeTool?  &#40;It is not currently listed
  in the drop-down.&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks everyone.'

  body: Paul,  <BR> <BR>you don&#39;t need &#34;grids&#34;. They are only provided
    for preview purposes, but you can easily design without them.  <BR> <BR>If you
    want to design a typeface for Khmer, simply design the glyphs and assign the Unicodes
    to them using the Glyph properties panel &#40;Edit / Properties&#41;.  <BR> <BR>If
    you desperately need the &#34;grid&#34;, you can modify the uranges.dat file that
    is in the Data folder within your TypeTool installation folder. The file is plain
    text with a simple structure.  <BR> <BR>Adam <BR>

  body: Done.   <BR> <BR>So, now that I&#39;ve assigned the character its &#40;Uni&#41;code
    and the typeface design is complete and installed in .ttf format, will it be Unicode
    compliant?
