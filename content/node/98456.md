  body: "The typeface in which the name of Annamarie V. Sandecki is set is certainly
    one I've seen before, but it isn't Akzidenz Grotesk or Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nIt could
    be \"AG Old Face\" from Berthold, though. Hmm...that <em>is</em> Akzidenz Grotesk
    also; perhaps the digitized versions changed the E?"
