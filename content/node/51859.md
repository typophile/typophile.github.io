  think.\r\nThis is my logo and business card. I am using a three folding format.\r\nAfter
  I added the pattern into the card, I feel my logo is too heavy or traditional. \r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\n"

    was inclined to look for your initials in it but looks more abstract."

  body: "I appreciate your feedback.\r\n\r\nT and K are in the logo. The both logo
    and pattern were derived from bamboo, which I have wanted to use for my logo.
    I love the pattern inside of the card (right side), but I feel it doesn't go with
    the logo because the logo has solid colors while the patterns are just lines.
    I am trying to edit the logo to have more organic shapes, but I still feel it
    is heavy. "
