body: "I recently designed a logo with a word mark and have had some problems with
  the font Felix Titling (Open Type). When it's printed on a laser printer the font
  becomes broken and difficult to read.\r\n\r\nI am trying to offer a solution to
  the client, however they really like the font and want to keep it in their logo.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions as to why the font is not printing clearly on laser printers?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nJackie"

  body: That's an awfully thin face to be used in a logo that may need to be reduced
    rather small. Have you tried turning the font to outlines?

  body: Maybe try centring the book above text just by looking? Its shape kinda tends
    to lean on the left side of text when it's centred geometrically...
