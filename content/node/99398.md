  body: "Hi Steve,\r\nyou can do a perspective correction in Photoshop, but it's a
    bit complex as it usually involves more than one steps - depending on the image:
    \r\nI usually perform an Arbitrary Rotate (to horizontalize the baseline) and
    then select the text area and do one or more Edit->Tranform->Perspective or Edit->Tranform->Skew
    operations.\r\n\r\nThe complexity -and the inaccuracy- of the above operations
    led me to design a new tool for our font identification software (Find my Font
    v3.1) which allow you to select an image area and perform any or all of the following
    operations as a single task:\r\n=> Deformation/Perspective correction\r\n=> Image
    enlargement\r\n=> Image mirroring\r\n=> Contrast correction\r\n=> Expand/Shrink
    Text width\r\n\r\nYou can find more details and an image example of how it works
    in the following Typophile thread:\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/92904\r\n"
