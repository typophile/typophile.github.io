  &#60;/a&#62; and came across this page - <a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/WaterGarden.html"

  <BR>&#34;<i> The display shown on the right is using the multiple colour fonts.
  There is a single colour and other version of this font. <BR> <BR>Colours are to
  be determined by the designer.</i>&#34; <BR> <BR>How do multiple color fonts work?

  body: Usually it&#39;s just the same font, but with different parts located in different
    font files. So you might have one font that serves as the background color &#40;looks
    normal&#41;, then another font that makes an inline color &#40;just looks like
    a bunch of partial flimsy letters&#41;. Layer them exactly on top of each other,
    pick your colors for each layer, and veeeooolla. <BR> <BR>Alan

    it would be different &#34;letters&#34; with the same kernning on top of one another.   <BR>   <BR>sweet.   <BR>   <BR>Thanks

  body: Yeah, my explanation did require a bit of unscrambling. It&#39;s basically
    just different parts of the same font put in different layers. LTR Federal is
    a great example of this.
