  body: The phrase <a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/Vanilla%20Ice%20Lyrics/Ice%20Ice%20Baby%20Lyrics.html">&#34;rockman
    lover&#34;</a> comes &#40;at least as far as I know&#41; from the mind of superstar
    rapper Vanilla Ice. <BR> <BR>The idea is indeed to achieve &#39;cool&#39; through
    cheese, although it really only exists because the idea made me laugh. Now a friend
    wants to put it on shirts for his website. <BR> <BR>I think it will work eventually,
    although I am admittedly an amateur. Not to mention that his face needs a LOT
    of work. The mullet must be made longer.... <BR> <BR>The type is disgusting, which
    is what I think it needs. The question is, though, too disgusting? Too Pacman?
    Here&#39;s a slightly tweaked version... <BR> <BR>And thanks to all who comment
    on this awful thing. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/64051.jpg"

  body: I think it&#39;s nicely cheesy. The problem is the sexual orientation. Most
    guys -even if they have no problem with other people being gay- might not like
    to leave the wrong idea by wearing it. So maybe it&#39;s more of a girl shirt?

  body: I know what you mean, Hrant. I want the guy to look silly, but not in a way
    that scares off too many people. I&#39;m going to try to &#34;man&#34; it up a
    bit
