body: "I've created a new font using FL5 (Windows). When I generate the font, I get
  this error message:\r\n\r\n[WARNING] <Cardo-Italic> Glyph class @Cardo-Italic redefined
  [C:/Users/David J. Perry/Documents/FontLab/Studio5/fontlab.fea 21]\r\n\r\nand likewise
  for fea22.  The font installs without complaint into Windows and works fine in Word
  2007, OpenOffice Writer, and Abiword.  If I open the generated font (the .otf or.tff
  file, not the original .vfb) in FL, everything looks OK.  BUT: When I test it in
  XeTeX, every letter is off by one; in other words, \"Now\" appears as \"Opx\".\r\n\r\n1)
  what does that error message mean?  is it serious?  how would I go about fixing
  it?\r\n2) is there any connection between the error message and the problem in XeTeX?
  \ A problem like this would seem to indicate something seriously wrong with the
  font, yet it works fine in other apps.\r\n3) it may not be an accident that the
  one app in which the font does not work (XeTeX) is the only one I have that support
  OT features (the font contains ligatures, historical forms, and oldstyle numerals).
  \ The OT features work correctly in FL's preview.\r\n\r\nAny help will be greatly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"

    In every case, I have my classes defined in both the *class* window and the *features*.
    If there is a disagreement, you get the message.\r\n\r\nPick one or the other.
    Since I write the features file off and use a text editor on them to do further
    work, I pick *features* as primary, and have all my classes there. When I get
    the message you got, it means I haven't cleared the separate *classes.* (with
    FL5 on a PC, I believe it is: window > panels > classes, then \"reset\".) \r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    if you want to keep the classes file (panel), I suppose you should not also have
    them in your features file.  \r\n\r\nTry this on a copy first, of course."

  body: "Not even if there is a disagreement. \r\n\r\nWhen compiling feature definitions,
    FontLab Studio automatically copies the class definitions from the Classes panel
    to the OpenType panel. But if there are already class definitions in the OpenType
    FEA syntax in the lower-right part of the OpenType panel, then each class is being
    defined twice. If you don't need the class definitions in the OpenType panel,
    just remove them from there. \r\n\r\nFormally speaking, the title of this thread
    is misleading. The thread is called \"Strange errors\" and the poster writes \"I
    get this error message\", but then cites a message that clearly says \"[WARNING]\",
    not \"[ERROR]\". So it's not an error message, it's a warning message. \r\n\r\nA
    \"warning\" is not an \"error\". In FontLab Studio, an error message in the Output
    panel is prefixed with \"[ERROR]\", while a warning message is prefixed with \"[WARNING]\".
    \r\n\r\nIn most applications, errors lead to a technical fail while warnings lead
    to a technically successful completion. Warnings are issued when the application
    can complete the process but its internal logic indicates there \"may\" be something
    wrong, so it raises a potential problem to the user, and it's up to the user to
    decide whether it's a \"real\" problem or one that the user can ignore. Errors
    are issues when the application cannot successfully complete a process at all.
    \r\n\r\nBased on this, it is evident that when it comes to seriousness, a warning
    message is less serious, and an error message is more serious. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Regarding XeTeX, there are some bugs in its underlying ICU Layout library,
    but I don't think any that would produce this kind of behavior. Did you use fontspec
    to access the font? If so, try accessing it directly (using plain XeTeX, not XeLaTeX)
    as in: \r\n\r\n<code>\\font\\samplefont = \"[/Library/Fonts/Cardo.otf]\" at 72pt\r\n\\samplefont</code>\r\n\r\nand
    see if the problem also occurs. If it doesn't, it would indicate some fontspec
    caching problem. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Charles and Adam,\r\nSomehow (I don't know how -- I'm sure I didn't type
    them twice) the classes for numbers and oldstyle numbers appeared in both the
    classes and the OT panel. Removing them from the latter eliminated the warning.
    \ Thank you.\r\n\r\nAdam,\r\nThank you for clarifying FL's message types.  I have,
    fortunately, never encountered ERROR in FL so I didn't know the difference . .
    . WARNING looks bad enough!  I'll try plain XeTeX, without fontspec, per your
    suggestion.\r\n\r\nDavid"
