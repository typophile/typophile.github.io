    Germans and the Swiss do get together now and then to officially put old  and
    unnecessary conventions from the German language to rest, after which they fall
    out of use pretty quickly."

    lot of useful insight into early twentieth century attempts to reform German.
    I don\u2019t recall which of them were actually successful, but there were a lot
    of ideas about chaning German going around in the 1910s and 20s."
