  a banner for a countertop installer, the banner is promoting a product they sell
  (Silestone).\r\n\r\nThe Silestone logo standards pamphlet specifies Scala Sans to
  be used on all promotional material. \r\n\r\nDo I have to purchase a license for
  the company? Or does Silestone's font license extend to this use?\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nByron"
