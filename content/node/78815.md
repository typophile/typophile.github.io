body: "Bright Grotesk is a new typeface I'm working on. It's a mixture of humanist
  & grotesk typefaces which is legible in small sizes yet charming in display sizes
  as well.\r\n\r\nThere's still lot's of inconsistencies here and there as I have
  only started working on it last week.\r\n\r\nAny comments & suggestions to improve
  it is highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n<img src=http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/482/brightgrotesk.jpg>\r\n<img

  body: Thanks Bendy! Yeah, I agree with the bold I'm not that happy with it either.
    I'm really a sucker at bold weights as you know.

    width & stroke consistency in all weights and will proceed with the italics once
    I'm happy with it."

    d, m, n, r, p, q' in the bolder weights. Is it better than the previous one?\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "I'm really liking this. So remember the pinch of salt, this is just some
    impressions...\r\n\r\nI think the shape of the original /a/ was more in keeping
    with the bowl-and-stick letters; the horizontal part of the bowl now looks a bit
    too 'realist' rather than humanist or grotesque. But I agree the weight wasn't
    right in the bolder weights, and a more monoline approach works better.\r\n\r\nLeg
    of /k/ in latest sample 'cupcake' looks like the strokes are not parallel. Overall
    shape needs a bit of fiddling I think. It's too wide?\r\n\r\nGenerally to me the
    straights look heavier than the rounds...especially /b/, /d/ etc. You'll need
    to balance that out.\r\n\r\nTail of /j/ looks out of place...again a more monoline
    approach will harmonise best I think. Curve of J needs smoothing at SE section.\r\n\r\nLove
    the way the spurs on /b/, /m/, /r/ etc are curved. On bolder weights they may
    not be long enough, need to descend/ascend further?\r\n\r\nIn lighter weights,
    /S/ and /s/ need more curl in the spine, they look a bit limp and flat.\r\n\r\nI
    understand the historical reasons for the choices on the heads of /t/ and /1/
    but I think it's not necessary to have those curves there. I'd prefer straights.\r\n\r\n/N/
    looks wide, especially in the bold weight.\r\n\r\nBold /8/ looks unbalanced, and
    the bold /2/ needs more bowl and is possibly a fraction too light. /5/ is possibly
    falling left.\r\n\r\nGreat design, keep it up! :)\r\n\r\n"

    the lowercase 'a'\r\n- updated lowercase 'g'\r\n- updated lowercase 'k'\r\n- updated
    lowercase j as per Ben's comment\r\n- updated lowercase 't' (You're right Ben
    now it is much more easier to read and the quirkiness feeling is gone too in the
    lighter weights since it is now straight)\r\n- updated numeral '1' eliminating
    the curve\r\n- updated numeral '2'\r\n- reduced the overall width by 5% (previous
    width feels a bit too wide)\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think guys =)"
