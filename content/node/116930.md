  body: At that time, logos were often drawn to order by lettering artists, and I
    think your example was done that way. The stroke weight and the shape of the serifs
    (the flat ones, not the curved ones) makes me think the artist was influenced
    by Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue's Cheltenham, introduced in the early 1900s and still
    popular in the 1940s.

  body: "To duplicate the rounded bottoms one could take a font like ITC Clearface
    Bold Italic and slant the letters left by 18 degrees.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ITCClearfaceBoldSlantedLeft18deg_4929.jpg]\r\nA
    good starting point for creating the Phillips letters.\r\nBTW the top terminal
    on _l_ can be used for the other letters if the angled peak is clipped to make
    it horizontal.\r\nDon"

  body: Don, that's a great idea to backslant an italic. I wouldn't have thought of
    someone doing that in the pre-digital era, but of course there was an analog tool--the
    pantograph--that type designers and others used for scaling and slanting letterforms.

  body: "Thank you Victor. \r\nI never underestimate the techniques of predigital
    designers. In addition to the pantograph -- used in type design since the 19th
    century -- photo lettering methods were developed at least as far back as 1936,
    the date Photo-Lettering, Inc. was founded. By 1945 photo lettering techniques
    or custom results from a photo lettering firm, would have been available to leading
    logo designers. It may have been an assist in  developing some features of the
    Phillips logo, but I agree with your original assessment that it would most likely
    have been drawn by hand.\r\nDon"
