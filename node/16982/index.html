  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve designed a logo for a company and I&rsquo;m using HTF&rsquo;s Bodoni. Do you think it&rsquo;s overkill if I&rsquo;m creating logo configurations using the correct sizes of Didot? &hellip; requiring the designer to choose the correct file for the required final size. I just finished setting all these files up and now I&rsquo;m wondering if I&rsquo;ve made using the logo more complicated than it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>In retrospect my typeface choice feels questionable. Think this is at odds with an important function of a good logo, working at all sizes. But maybe that&rsquo;s all ok &hellip; just got some particular usage requirements which aid the goal of looking good at all sizes. <a href="http://www.thekyostudio.com/vallani/Vallani_logo_cd.pdf">This is a pdf</a> I was going to include with the files on a CD. Then attached that CD inside of a spiral bound booklet with <a href="http://www.thekyostudio.com/vallani/Vallani_logoBooklet.pdf">these pages</a>. I&rsquo;ve got some kind of weird design remorse from looking at the dang thing too much.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The problem might be the capacity of your client to manage this brand system, if they have their own designer this should not be a problem, but if they don&rsquo;t either you or some other respectable designer will be doing all of their stuff or you will have problems with people using the wrong optical size all the time.</p>
<p>Also you have to do a clear guide for this thing, I can´t see where you are telling which size is for which usages or size ranges. It has to be clear and simple.</p>
<p>I find the multiple logo configurations to be more problematic than the size ranges, if you choose a wrong size it may not hurt as much as if you have a disjointed logo whose parts will be randomly used. It is very suceptible to an asistematicity.</p>
<p>I would only go for logo configurations A-3 and C-3 and would reserve the symbol for special usages (page 9, second pdf).</p>

<p>Pre-digital, design firms would supply repro-quality logo sheets with the logo at different sizes, to be used pasted-up size-as in things like pub-set newspaper advertisements, brochures prepared by third parties, eg direct-mail specialists or retail store flyers.</p>
<p>Top designers, working for blue-chip companies, provide standards manuals for logo usage, which are implemented in-house by &ldquo;logo police&rdquo;. If something like color can be a big issue for conformity, why not optical size?</p>
<p>An engineer would be inclined to create a &ldquo;multiple master&rdquo; file that displays the correct optical size of the logo, depending on its scaling in the layout/rasterizing application.</p>
<p>But why should such things be automated? Automation lessens the appreciation for such subtleties, because it removes the necessity for production artists to know and care about such things.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It might be easier to encourage proper use if you showed examples which demonstrated why you have chosen to do this, perhaps overlaying the logos at a large size so the differences are obvious.</p>
<p>It might also be an idea to provide templates in Quark or InDesign for some basic page/ad sizes with the correct logos in place.</p>
<p>In your booklet provide the file name and the minimum size it can be used, I have included that information in the file name in the past, e.g. bloggs_cmyk_55mm.eps. I would also include a pdf of the booklet on the CD with a .zip folder(s) of logos so the brand guardian/printbuyer can e-mail the information with any design brief.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s certainly a wonderful idea, but as Héctor implies it depends on the capacity of the user. Good design always puts itself in the context of the user - otherwise it can backfire, or at least waste your time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just want to thank all of you. It was excellent feedback and very helpful.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got this as the <a href="http://www.thekyostudio.com/vallani/Vallani_LogoBooklet.pdf"  target="_blank">final pdf</a>. I think I&rsquo;ll end up the primary designer for them.</p>
<p>As a lone designer, it&rsquo;s nice to get some feedback from individuals such as yourselves. Crit from associates is definitely on the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; side of working at a firm or agency.</p>
<p>Much respect to all of you!</p>
