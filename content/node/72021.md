  game is called Baroque and was on the Wii. We're curious because it holds up pretty
  well for an in game serif font.\r\n\r\nThanks all."

  body: Agree on the Optima for the sans serif. The serif looks much like Palatino
    in proportion, but a little narrower and the Ps don't match (closed vs. open in
    Palatino)

  body: 'A big thanks guys. I''m so sorry it took me so long to post back, it appears
    really ungrateful. I originally posted in the middle of work and forgot to track
    replies as it wasn''t something critical to the project but personal curiosity.
    Optima was my first guess but the lower case g in Angelic is different and the
    size difference between caps and lower case is off. Close though. '
