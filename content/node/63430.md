  that the type is hand drawn, and the word is uncommon, I'm worried about the viewer's
  ability to pick up the name. Any feedback would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJim[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tk_5599.gif]"

  body: "This looks fun, but I too get lost between the k and ker. Also, you can do
    more of that thorny thing on some other letters.\r\n\r\nWhat's the explanation
    behind the troll symbol? And is that a flame on his head?"

  body: Yes, it's a candle flame. The symbol is based on a Welsh legend - it's a tiny
    miner that would haunt/protect gold mines.

  body: If it needs to read Tommyknocker I would suggest keeping the Tommy as if one
    word and making the second O show enough to not be confused with a C. The way
    it looks now I read Tom as a separate work and then I see MYNKC in a row.

- body: "Tom MykncCker. \r\n\r\nIt's cool, but illegible. Have you tried using color
    to separate the Tommy from Knocker? That might be enough - if people read \"Tommy\"
    clearly, then \"Knocker\" might be more evident.\r\n\r\nMaybe?"

  body: Is it really supposed to say Tommy Knocker? Damn that's bad. It looks fun
    though, but I would probably put the "Tommy" part all on the left side without
    the first M at the top, but instead lower, so that it would say "Tommy" diagonally.
    If done right, it will bring the Y more to the left so you have more room for
    "Knocker" so you won't have to do that horror with the "noc" part. Don't make
    "no" into one letter/symbol, don't cut the "o" in half, and don't make the "c"
    so big. That being said, I do need to compliment you on the style of the letters
    and the illustration. Nice work there.
