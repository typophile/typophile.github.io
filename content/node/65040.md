  body: "Yeah, I was looking for this too since it was posted, but I have had no luck
    finding a match. The A is the odd feature. Has anyone tried WTF to see if it could
    find the letters? If you had more letters, the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    ID Guide]] might be helpful too. I tried, but with only the E, M and U as key
    letters, I got 43 fonts without any solid leads, which makes me think it's not
    something I have collected there in nearly 1,800 families. Several seem close,
    except for the A.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
