  body: "maybe simplify it by moving the exclamation point at the end to where the
    'i' is and putting the dot on top instead of underneath.\r\nso basically, make
    the i out of an exclamation point instead of using it at the end. it will look
    like an icecream cone.\r\n"

    onto the lower part of its letterform?\r\nmaybe still to blatant.\r\n\r\nanyway,
    i like the typeface and the composition.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nderek\r\n"

  body: "i was thinking that you would maintain the height/size of the i, but just
    bring the dot down to touch/rest on (or even a little beneath) the stem.\r\n\r\nso
    the dot of the i alludes to a scoop sitting on a cone.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm not really a fan of caps-on-caps. I think \"Gelateria\" would read better
    in either small caps or lower case. Also, you should either cut the ornament,
    or draw your own. I would just cut it \u2013 it does nothing but complicate the
    logo. It seems awkward and out of place. The type has enough character on its
    own. Plus, once the ornament is gone, you'll be able to add more letterspacing
    to \"Gelateria\" which I think it desperately needs to be legible at small sizes.\r\n\r\nAnother
    issue with that ornament is the color. You're having to screen the \"\xB7\" and
    \"Gelateria\" which makes no sense. Those are important enough to deserve solid
    color at full opacicty. Eliminating the ornament will allow you to do this without
    compromising anything."

  body: Too many colors for my taste. Try using only two -- black, and color of coffee
    (somewhat darker and a bit more red-ish than the one currently used for "GELATERIA").

  body: Also, I think the ornament looks a bit out of place. Maybe it'd be better
    if mirrored (left-right flip).
