  Sound and the Fury\" was published in 1929 -- he imagined a way to make the section
  clearer to readers. \"I wish publishing was advanced enough to use colored ink,\"
  Faulkner wrote to his editor, \"as I argued with you and Hal in the Speakeasy that
  day.\" \r\n\r\n\"I'll just have to save the idea until publishing grows up,\" he
  added, inadvertently launching a challenge to future publishers. Nine decades later,
  the Folio Society took it up.\r\n\r\nIn a special edition, the Folio Society is
  publishing \"The Sound and the Fury\" in 14 colors. It's a fine press edition, quarter-bound
  in leather, with a slipcase and an additional volume of commentary. It also includes
  a color-coded bookmark that reveals which time period is designated by each color.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n[[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2012/07/the-sound-and-the-fury-as-william-faulkner-imagined-in-color.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+JacketCopy+%28Jacket+Copy%29&utm_content=Google+Reader|link]] "

    for some evidence thereof\u2014but, quite frankly and IMHO, it was not his strong
    suit.\r\n\r\nHowever, writing some pretty compelling and innovative\u2014for the
    time\u2014fiction WAS his strong suit. Virtually every piece of his fiction has
    entertained, captivated and challenged me.\r\n\r\nSo, your choice: focus on the
    insignificant details about something the guy did with mixed success, or learn
    a little something about life from what the guy did very, very well.\r\n\r\nIMHO..."
