    how smart is it?\r\n\r\nDesigning \"metaglyph systems\" is to drawing glyphs what
    drawing glyphs is to lettering. I think most people who prefer drawing glyphs
    over lettering would prefer making systems even more (if/once it's easy and powerful
    enough). A good litmus test might be: do you enjoy spacing a font?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
