  to make it looks fine at small size on a screen (without any hinting). Therefor
  I need to find a way to make it looks well optically. I've found the Bell Centennial
  font (below) that has enormous ink traps so I will be really grateful if you can
  give any other exemples that may help me.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A_5250.png]\r\n\r\nYou
  can also find the first tests I've done attached below."

    won't make much sense on screen...as there really isn't such a thing as 'pixel
    spread' ;o)"

  body: "Trapping actually does make sense onscreen, although less on an LCD than
    a CRT. But even on an LCD it help because a big reason trapping in general is
    useful is that it fights optical degradation, not just \"mechanical\". At small
    sizes funny things happen, as Dwiggins discovered so explicitly.\r\n\r\nJas, it
    looks like you're making an outline font that tries to look good onscreen, as
    opposed to a true pixelfont. Which is one good way to go, especially since that
    means it will be usable for print. But know that you will end up compromising
    the screen rendering to a good degree (unless you do mountains and mountains of
    hinting).\r\n\r\nBut in any case looking at your PDF you really have to worry
    about the more \"macro\" features looking good on screen first - like the right
    stem of the \"n\". Even just that is a challenge - and bitmap trapping is a level
    (or two) above that...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Don't get too distracted by ink traps. Those were developed to compensate
    for very real conditions in a specific printing environment. The issues with a
    screen-optimized face are very different; as Hrant points out, it's larger issues
    like stem weight, counters, sidebearings, overshoot, etc. to worry about. If you
    don't have to match a print version, it frees you up to choose optimal proportions
    and placement of the most important features, and it is really quite different
    when you have that freedom. For instance, if you have to match a print font, sometimes
    you end up with very cramped or bent-looking shapes to AKMNVWkvwy. If you start
    with bitmaps, you can design them from the beginning to look right onscreen. Spacing,
    character shapes and things like dots and accents will benefit greatly.

  body: "Thanks a lot! \r\nThe main idea of my font is to find how to draw a font
    to make it look good on screen without using any hinting (just like ink traps
    are working for printed typography). The font is mainly intended to be used at
    12 or 14pt on a 72dpi screen and I like the idea that the font will look (absurdly)
    different at a big size."

  body: "Yes, if you get sorted with a specfic target PPEM you are off & running.
    This kind of project will be complicated inevitably by the fact that different
    PC laptops can have different PPEMs and the fact that Different OS' have different
    ways of rendering. So in some ways to do something that isn't fairly mad you will
    be better off accepting that not all computer screens will be optimal for your
    font. If it's a Mac your talking about ( sounds like it to me! ) then it will
    be much more predictable - but there are still screen differences to stay aware
    of.\r\n\r\nCarl is right that trapping could be blind alley for your purposes.
    In my case I have found that they mostly help to make text look mushy on screen.
    And Carl & Hrant are right that figuring out what you want in greyscale first
    might help you to clarify your intent - what the finnished rendering should look
    like.\r\n\r\nHere are some more links:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rogerblack.com/blog/second_font_war\r\nhttp://www.rogerblack.com/blog/screen_fonts_history\r\n\r\nrelated\r\n\r\nhttp://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/openfontlibrary/2007-February/000377.html\r\nhttp://www.type4screen.com/?cat=8"
