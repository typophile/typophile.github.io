  body: I think the letters and numbers on playing cards are usually drawn as part
    of the card design. I&#39;ve never seen recognizable typefaces on standard playing
    cards.

  body: <a href="http://members.aol.com/fontner/frontpage.html" target="_blank"> Harold
    Lohner</a> couldn&#39;t find a font either, so he created one last year. It&#39;s
    called Card Characters. I don&#39;t find it under any of his categories, so just
    look in the C&#39;s. Some characters do vary from yours, as Mark suggested would
    be the case. <BR> <BR>On his  his home page, I see that he just released Harold&#39;s
    Pips too, which has glyphs for the card suits.

  body: Sometimes I have used City Light. It&#39;s not the same, of course, but I
    think it could work fine.
