  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello everyone.  Just wanted to take a quick survey of sorts: <BR> <BR>1)  How many of you design your type from scratch in Illustrator (no scanned images, just pure composition inside the program)? <BR> <BR>2)  How many of you draft the glyphs first by hand, then edit that draft in Illustrator? <BR> <BR>3)  Do any of you use Illustrator (or any comparable program) simply to get the image in EPS format so you can do the majority of aesthetic work in FontLab? <BR> <BR>It seems like more of #3 should be happening than what I suspect actually is&ndash;and it's a wonder, because FontLab has some really great glyph-construction tools (I don't mean to sound like I work for FontLab, no offense to those who do). <BR> <BR>Oh, and why do you feel that your method is best?</div>

Often times I only make one word to start usually less than 8 letters long. <BR> <BR>It's like a piece of dirt in an oyster that starts a pearl. I rely on my first tracing/drawing to capture the gesture of the face and if it looks right on screen then I give myself the green light to proceed with more of the characters and flesh out the entire font in Illustrator 8.0. <BR> <BR>Honestly the making of the font goes MUCH faster if it's drawn well first and I find Illustrator to be that tool for me. I reply on the peices and parts of other letters for consistent rules on how to make the rest of the glyphs in the face so I need the entire font in front of me at all times on the pasteboard. <BR> <BR>Beyond that, it's a quick import to FOG and a few hours to complete the font. I use FOG/FLAB strictly as technical font development and production tools and nothing more. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I do almost all my work directly in FontLab. I almost never scan an image: even if I am using analogue artwork, I'll just prop it beside my monitor and interpret it in the FontLab glyph window. <BR> <BR>I often start designs with a period of what I generically term 'research' which often involves a variety of writing implements. Usually this is to understand the organic development of a particular script style, rather than 'design' per se. <BR> <BR>By the way, Tim Holloway, brilliant designer of Arabic and Indic typefaces, told me about a clever technique he has used in the past: draw outlines on clear mylar with a translucent red pen, then tape the mylar over your computer screen and digitise the outline in the background. Very clever, and much more efficient than scanning, tracing, cleanup etc.</div>

I'll doodle and think and such, but unless the font is based substantially on sources outside my head, I'll work directly in FontLab to do the real drawing, without scans. <BR> <BR>But then again, I don't spend nearly as high a percentage of my time drawing letters as some people on this forum. Maybe I'd have evolved a different work style if I spent 40+ hours a week on it instead of 5-20. <BR> <BR>T</div>

A small word is first drawn, then I make as many obvious spin-off letters from what I have, then I refer to all the letters I've created to make the remaining glyphs to flesh out the font set. <BR> <BR>At all times I find I need to be able to see every letter I've drawn to see what parts and peices I need to steal from it to make another glyph from it. Illustrator uses a large pasteboard area which makes this easy for me to do. <BR> <BR>I can't see drawing an entire font in FLAB all in one glyph slot and then moving each glyph into its own slot. <BR> <BR>Another part of it is that I'm quite fast with Illustrator since I've been working with it since version 3.0 as a young design pup, so I'm not inclined to move away from that especially when you consider that it still requires the same effort to draw a glyph outline in either program. <BR> <BR>Now regarding my other comment regardint font production, I port all my drawn glyphs into FOG then do the spacing, kerning and hinting and generate the font. Then I import it into FLAB and correct the Font Info double check the hinting and export the PS versions. I save an alternate copy, change the em to 2048, apply the TT specific features and generate that version. Like I said all production since there is no further creative decisions required at that point in the fonts development. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D <BR> <BR>PS: Yep, a couple of hours it all it takes to space and kern a font. It always comes back to well drawn character sets.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I cut my vector teeth on FreeHand pretty much before Adobe even showed up on the software scene. Never bothered to port over to Illustrator (that double arrow thing always confused me for some silly reason). So drawing directly in FOG [same folks who made FreeHand; similar interface back then] has always been my preference, rather than starting somewhere else.  <BR> <BR>I work my ideas out on paper. At least to get started. I used to draw just about every glyph first, but now mostly just the key characters to get the foundation firmly established. Or especially tricky characters where the vectors just seem too unruly. <BR> <BR>I do my working drawings in HB mechanical pencil on Clearprint. I rule out &quot;slug&quot; lines at 250 points (i.e., 1:4 ratio to the 1000 PS em square) and a baseline and x-height. I love drawing and fine-tuning letters on paper. <BR> <BR>Then I scan my characters and paste them into the template in FOG and digitize directly there.  <BR> <BR>Lately I'm getting more comfortable working directly in FOG without bothering to scan the sketches &ndash; much like John described : sort of like a punchcutter interpreting a drawn model. <BR> <BR>I know I should switch to FLab, but Fog is now second nature and so I'm just lazy. I'd rather focus on the ideas and not struggle with the tool. Same problem I have with switching to Indy from Quark. Intellectually, I know it's better and more efficient; but in the short term it's just plain frustrating and too much bother. (Hey, Carter still uses Fog 3.1, right? Good enough for him, good enough for me. Well, sounds like a good excuse anyway.) <BR> <BR>While I understand why Stuart and others like him work the way they do, that seems more appropriate for display designs. (No disrespect, Stuart.) <BR> <BR>Since my chosen arena is text typefaces, I can't imagine not designing in an environment where spacing is integral and I always keep a metrics window open. In fact, I wish I could edit outlines directly in a metrics window (wasn't Mark fantasizing about this once?). <BR> <BR>I spent more like several months spacing and kerning Whitman. (Hard to say exactly, because it was mostly evenings and weekends.) I'd like to think that I'm getting faster and better, but I still think spacing takes as much, if not more, time than actual character design. <BR> <BR>My ideas generally come from &quot;What If&quot; scenarios. Sort of like Einstein's famous thought experiments. Whitman grew out of something like &quot;What if Dwiggins had designed Joanna instead of Gill?&quot; Stadler (in development) is an experiment in &quot;What if Mozart were a punchcutter (instead of a composer) and Anton Stadler were a printer (instead of a clarinetist), and Mozart created a typeface for him, instead of the Clarinet Concerto?&quot; I usually have a verbal, conceptual brief for the design even before I have a clear visual image. There is a felt sense of something possible or some road not taken, long before I discover what it actually looks like. <BR> <BR>There are always references to other sources, historic and contemporary. These usually have a love/hate component and a certain amount of hubris &ndash; &quot;This has some nice aspects, but I would have done it this way.&quot; <BR> <BR>These are starting points. Once the face takes shape, it tends to gain a life of its own and evolves according to its own inner logic, and the concepts and references take a back seat to What Works.  <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR></div>

My thought experiments usually go something like 'What if Constantinople had never fallen to the Turks, and the Greek script had continued to evolve in closer contact to the Middle East than to Western Europe?' <BR> <BR>Recently, I've been asking myself the larger question: What if the advent of typography had not frozen our scripts? &ndash; as mass printing also froze much of our knowledge: a kind of filter through which we perceive the manuscript world.* I'm increasingly interested in palaeography (and not just because it gives me a whole new avenue of book collecting!), and the rich variety of letterforms before the standardisation of typography. I think it is ironical that much of the history of type, especially from the 19th century on, has involved a conscious effort to massively expand the variety of letterforms &ndash; hence the huge number of fonts now available &ndash;, but most of it has been largely unconscious of the historical variety that preceded Gutenberg et al. <BR> <BR> <BR>* Colette Sirat makes this point very well in her <i>Hebrew manuscripts of the Middle Ages,</i> when she notes how most of what we know about pre-typographic history, culture and thought is determined by which manuscripts were deemed commercially viable by the early printer publishers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>John, that's a good point (although I think &quot;frozen&quot; is too strong).</i> <BR> <BR>Probably. If you think about it, though, early type founding and printing derived directly from the specific formal writing hands employed in particular places at a specific point in time, and just about all type design since has been in reaction to and evolved from those models. Type designers have generally only gone back to pre-Gutenberg models for display types and to deliberately evoke historical periods, usually in fairly crude and superficial ways. There seems to have been relatively little exchange between type design and serious palaeographical scholarship. <BR> <BR>In broader terms, 'frozen' is certainly too strong a word to  rhetorically describe the general solidifying of our image of the pre-typographic world based on what printers considered worth preserving in the new media. A better image is of print as a filter through which only some of the past has come down to us.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>naperstgo</i> are the usual suspects for drawing and working out ideas. But . . . <BR> <BR>When the work begins in earnest &ndash; i.e., digital &ndash; I usually start with 'h n o p'. Establish stem weight, foot serif treatment, head serifs, ascender, descender, bowl, arched counterform, counter and width relationships; I might work these quite a bit and work out preliminary spacing as well.  <BR> <BR>Then typically 'm u i l' are derived without sketches or scans. And more spacing tweaks. The 'r' comes soon after and is sometimes worked directly on screen, sometimes scanned, depending upon the design.  <BR> <BR>'b d' might be derived at this point, to check and refine the bowl design. <BR> <BR>Then 'a g' are brought in about now, maybe sooner. This is where things get interesting. These characters usually make it or break it for me. 'e' might get scanned, or might get drawn directly on screen. Quite a bit of spacing tweaks may follow. <BR> <BR>After this, things progress variably. The goal is to get to 'hamburgefontsiv' (with 'pldc' usually thrown in for good measure). I often work out comma, period, hyphen, and apostrophe even before lc is fully developed. Sometimes the question mark. And determine the spaceband. The point is to start setting as much trial text as soon as I can and then keep adding and refining. (I will confess that 'k' and 'x' are almost always last.) <BR> <BR>When I get to caps, 'H O' are the standard starting point to establish height, weight, and width relation to each other and the lc. Spacing also gets some attention in relation to each other and lc. From there, the easy caps 'I E F T L' are quickly derived. Then usually 'M N' &ndash; they might get sketched a bit first, and the 'M' often scanned.  <BR> <BR>After that, usually the 'A V W' or 'P R B'. 'R' is always sketched quite a bit and usually scanned. <BR> <BR>This is a general reflective description I'm making up here, not any kind of well-honed, tried-and-true methodology. Just reflecting on how things seem to go these days and how my own personal, self-taught habits have developed. (Interesting exercise.) <BR> <BR>It's not really as linear as it sounds, every new character can provoke reevaluation of everything else. <BR> <BR>Type design is still an evenings-and-weekends, in-between-jobs venture for me, so work on any given design will proceed slowly and in fits and starts.  <BR> <BR>&ndash; K. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; But while I'm at it, I will mention one pet peeve about the FLab metrics window.  <BR>&gt; Because the data readout for the metrics is at the top of the window, when I  <BR>&gt; want to toggle kerning on and off to compare the effect of kerning, the preview  <BR>&gt; jumps up and down &ndash; which completely defeats the ability to compare the effect.  <BR> <BR>&gt; Does this make sense? Does anyone else experience this and does it bug them? <BR> <BR>Yes! So much so that I've stopped comparing them. Not good. <BR> <BR>It's almost as cumbersome as the keystroke for toggling through <BR>a list of kerning pairs. Apple/Page Up + Page Down. <BR>Or Option/4 for the Measurement tool&hellip; <BR>I'll stop.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah yes, the measurement tool &ndash; another pet peeve, and a reason I stay comfortably ensconced in Fog. Fog's constant display of the relative distance between the cursor and a selected point is an important convenience, one that I sorely (and cursedly) miss whenever I am in FLab. Really slows me down. <BR> <BR>Does anyone else miss this? <BR> <BR>Yuri, how hard would it be to add this info to the data bar in the glyph window? <BR> <BR>Sorry.

		<div class="commentbody">Yuri, one thing that does strike me as perhaps being useful would be a 'smart' palette or ghost layers of related glyphs and glyph peices. <BR> <BR>I usually build my h, n, and r together, so it would make sense that I can quickly see an onionskin of them behind what I'm working on OR have the peices available to me to construct that glyph. <BR> <BR>Leslie Cabarga illustrates this point quite nicely in his Font book. <BR> <BR>Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Stuart:  <BR>good idea, I will look into it. Can you send me a sample list of &quot;related&quot; glyph groups, for LC and UC, Latin script. I only afraid that display of more than one outline will slow down rendering and editing, but you can always get faster pc :-) <BR> <BR>Kent:  <BR>OK, it will measure distance (direct and h-v) and angle from the &quot;active&quot; node or single selected node to the &quot;free&quot; cursor, OK? <BR> <BR>Eric: <BR>OK, I'll try to do something with &quot;jumping lines&quot; in the new Metrics window. <BR> <BR>I'd recommend to leave this thread with FL-related questions, it looks to be offtopic here.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Before we end this discussion, I'll add this since it is significant to our discussion regarding drawing glyphs and is on topic. <BR> <BR>On page 215 of Leslie's Logo and Lettering Bible, at the bottom of the page is a fantastic description called Shape groups which refers to related glyph forms that share common elements. <BR> <BR>With respect to Leslie I will leave you with that information to look up on your own. Yuri, I will ask Leslie for permission to send you a scan of the page to define exactly what I'm referring to. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Stuart :D</div>
