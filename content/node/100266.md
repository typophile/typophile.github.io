  The phony global warming cult has a core purpose. Their objective is to drive down
  the standard of living for non-elites and prevent the use of fossil fuel energy.
  The fallacious science used to create a disinformation scare for politically unsophisticated
  \u201CTrue Believers\u201D is a direct result of transnational money manipulators.
  The Davos crowd sponsors the educational and media institutions that trump up junk

    science is that which differs from the consensus of recognized competent researchers.\r\n\r\nIt
    is trivially possible to avoid the bad consequences for people living in tropical
    Third World countries of global warming without reducing energy consumption.\r\n\r\nNuclear
    power can provide us with electricity to meet all our needs dependably for hundreds
    of years; unlike fusion power, thorium breeders are already practical.\r\n\r\nElectricity
    can heat our homes. What about our cars?\r\n\r\nElectrolysis can make hydrogen
    from water, but it's not so easy to make carbon from carbon dioxide. Fortunately,
    hydrogen can be used with carbon dioxide as an input to the Sabatier process,
    the outputs of which can be used as the inputs of the Fischer-Tropsch process.\r\n\r\nFischer-Tropsch:
    it's not just for making motor fuel out of coal any more.\r\n\r\nSo, there you
    are: total carbon neutrality, with no need to run out and buy new cars."

    some kind of a joke, or maybe you just gathered information from different site
    and copied it huh? You know so little about scams and how it really works. Actually
    the things you provided are common knowledge not worth blogging.

    Mayor Cas Holloway announced at a press conference Thursday the city's approval
    of a plan to convert organic waste and wastewater from schools and as many as
    100,000 homes into a biogas that is mostly methane, which is already being used
    to power thousands of homes in the city.\r\n\r\nOrganice waste from schools and
    homes, such as old fruits and vegetables, will be converted to house-heating energy
    through a program introduced by the city on Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe city's new scheme
    for getting rid of food waste is a gas, gas, gas.\r\n\r\nIt works like this: Collect
    banana peels, apple cores and other organic waste from city public schools and
    haul them to the Waste Management garbage treatment facility in Williamsburg to
    be turned into a soupy bio-slurry.\r\n\r\nShip that to the nearby Newtown Creek
    Wastewater Treatment Plant in Greenpoint and mix it with wastewater sludge to
    create a biogas that is mostly methane, the main component of natural gas.\r\n\r\n

    is a world leader at something rather dubious</strong>\r\n\r\nSINCE October sightseers
    on the hills above Edinburgh have gawped at a brand new landmark. Across the Firth
    of Forth, on a test site, stands the biggest wind turbine in Britain. The tips
    of its blades rise 196m above sea level. Its rotor sweeps an area twice as large
    as the London Eye. This monster and others like it are bound for the North Sea\u2014part
    of the biggest and most ambitious offshore wind programme in the world.\r\nBritain
    gets more electricity from offshore wind farms than all other countries combined.
    In 2012 it added nearly five times more offshore capacity than Belgium, the next
    keenest nation, and ten times more than Germany. Its waters already contain more
    than 1,000 turbines, and the government thinks capacity could triple in six years.
    Boosters think Britain a global pioneer. Critics say ministers are flogging a
    costly boondoggle.\r\n\r\nTwo things explain Britain\u2019s enthusiasm for offshore
    wind turbines. First, the country is committed by European law to generate about
    30% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020, up from about 13% now.
    Nuclear energy does not count and Britain is well behind on solar power, which
    means lots more wind turbines and biomass plants (mostly wood-burning power stations)
    will be required.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.economist.com/news/britain/21592615-britain-world-leader-something-rather-dubious-rueing-waves\r\n\r\n"
