  image.  I'm thinking it could be part of the Futura family.  Thanks in advance for
  any help.

  body: "It's CLOSE to Futura Extrabold, but not quite; I suspect that it's handwork
    applied to the original font. Specific differences: the O appears to be perfectly
    round in the sample, whereas the same character in FEB is not quite. Likewise,
    the angles of the arms on the W and the A have been modified to fit differently
    from the original. Scaling the A 110% horizontally comes close to your sample,
    but both characters would need some fiddling to match it.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/popwar2.gif]"
