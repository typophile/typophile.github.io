    you access to a report and a pre-popluated e-mail you can send to the download

    sure folks Googling for a font will find authorized retailers before they find

    would happen somewhat over the long run the more download sites cooperate, but
    here's an idea that might help it along: instead of relying solely on the font
    houses' own site(s) maybe TypeSnitch could -with each font house's consent- have
    a (Google-searchable) page that directs people searching for a font (that is subscribed
    to TypeSnitch) to where to buy it. With enough visits and links (and hopefully
    whatever else is in Google magic potion) that page might become a high-ranked

    definitely improve the service since it would make it possible to simultaneously
    submit a takedown e-mail and send Google a copyright violation notice, especially
    in cases when the site owner is non-compliant. The service is still very much
    needed since the work to locate all infringing instances is better automated than
    manual.\r\n\r\n@ Dave - Absolutely! The idea is to generate populated e-mails
    that foundries can send from the site and move towards fully automated e-mails
    quickly. The dream is to make this a fully automated service rather spend time
    manually ticking through work that can be automated. Right now, it's a one time
    buy-in fee specific to the fonts you're looking to find and remove.\r\n\r\n@ Bendy
    - When the font is renamed or 'cribbed', one need only add a new font name to
    the service and start looking for that one as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, we're at 78%

  body: There could be a section where users can send in URLs they have found that
    may not be easy to find in Google. At the moment, when I come across illegal downloads
    of my own fonts, I generally come across plenty of other foundries' fonts too.
    Right now it's not really plausible to be emailing foundries every time I see
    their fonts available, but if it was just a matter of sending the URL to Typesnitch,
    that would be easy and I think the type design community would work together to
    protect not just their own fonts, but everyone's.

  body: "Hey Gang,\r\n\r\nSorry you're all off-base . . . Firstly, I have no dreams
    on making another Identifont, not even close . . .\r\n\r\nTypeSnitch is simply
    a tool for font foundry owners to find 'freely' distributed versions of their
    commercial for sale only fonts floating all over the internet that shouldn't be
    there and automates the task of getting them removed via automated or manually
    executed take-down letters, DCMAs, etc and building relationships with site owners
    who didn't know the fonts were there to get them removed and generally doing what
    the service can to assure the top search results for a font name yield ACTUAL
    retailers of the fonts first and not free downloads of the fonts.\r\n\r\nTypeSnitch
    is a tool and nothing more and one that I think myself and a lot of font designers
    really need to preserve the value of their libraries. I'd much prefer to make
    fonts and negotiate licenses than troll the internet and send take-down letters
    all day and figured there must be a way it could be automated if such a tool was
    built for this task, so I got in touch with a developer who agreed the idea made
    sense and if it could be funded would be built .\r\n\r\nI'm pleased with how quickly
    it received funding which means lots of folks support the idea and as the funding
    increases, it gives the developer more capital to make the service better. To
    be absolutely clear about this, while I'm a primary driver of the effort, I haven't
    and won't ever receive a dime of the funds donated, they 100% go to the developer
    and PayPal who takes their cut to accept the funds.\r\n\r\nI suspect over time,
    the cash I donated to fund the effort will be easily returned in legitimate font
    sales of my works and it gives me peace of mind that I'm doing something to assure
    the sites that shouldn't have 'em don't. The fact that I opened up the project
    so other font designers could participate was because I knew it was a tool others
    needed, just as I do and to be more than fully funded in under 3 weeks proves
    that.\r\n\r\nLastly, I must point out the ONLY comparison to Identifont was made
    as a suggestion by Hrant just above in this thread about what the service COULD
    be and I'm honestly puzzled how quickly the wheels fell off the train with Stephen
    and Nick's posts since nothing I'd ever posted suggested TypeSnitch would be an
    Identifont type service.\r\n\r\nAnd Nick, I'm not sure what you're getting at
    but you are welcomed to e-mail me offline at (diner at fontdiner dot com) if you
    have some dirty laundry you feel the need to air and FWIW, I think you have a
    wonderful library and respect your work but honestly have been deeply perplexed
    by your need to give it away freely and presume it will retain any value, perhaps
    I'm mis-understanding your intentions.\r\n\r\nCalm heads everyone please, I do
    feel like I just broke up a lynch mob . . . Please ask questions rather jumping
    to conclusions so the wrong information isn't being communicated carelessly."
