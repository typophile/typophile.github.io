  was used in a credit slate I made a while ago. The PSD file is nowhere to be seen,
  it definitely isn't any font I have on my computer nor can WhatTheFont find a positive
  match. I'm really stumped. If anyone is in an investigative mood, that would be
  very appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/racine_6467.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/starring_4277.jpg]"
