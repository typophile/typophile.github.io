  my first Arabic font (and first font overall) I can't help but wonder, is there
  an easier way?\r\nI'm a flash designer, and im wondering, since flash is vector
  based, and so is fontlab, is there perhaps someway of designing the glyphs in flash
  and then importing them into fontLab?\r\nI'm guessing not, but I honestly think
  the flash method of creating outlines (using the line tool) is much more user friendly
  than the method in fontLab, though that's probably a biased point of view (since
  I've been using flash for close on 6 years now and just started with fontLabs).\r\nSo,
  to get to the point, is there an easier way to design glyphs?\r\nEven if I were
  somehow able to import a bitmap and have it in the background just to use as a guide,
  that would be helpful.\r\nSo, if anyone knows of such a method, sharing would be
  appreciated.\r\nThanks"

  body: "Fontlab allows you to import EPS files (<em>menu</em> Glyph \u2014> Import
    from EPS...).\r\n\r\nHowever, I just tried to import an EPS 3.0 file generated
    with Flash MX 2004,\r\nbut it didn't work as expected \u2014 Fontlab imported
    some paths, but these \r\nlooked like an explosion of the shapes I had drawn :^/\r\n\r\nSo,
    you can still use Flash to draw your glyphs, but you'll have to use Illustrator\r\nfor
    an intermediate step. This consists of opening the EPS or AI file generated\r\nwith
    Flash, and saving it in a format that Fontlab understands. In alternative,\r\nafter
    opening the files, you can Copy/Paste the paths from Illustrator directly\r\ninto
    Fontlab.\r\n\r\nIt's all documented here: <a href=\"http://groups.msn.com/FontLab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2675\">Using
    Illustrator to draw typefaces</a>"

  body: "wow, thnx a lot...it really helped (the glyphs are looking a lot better now)...\r\njust
    a question though...by finding the glyph drawing methods in fontlab somewhat cumbersome,
    am i the norm or the exception?\r\ni mean, its a great software, but if its so
    widely used, why don't they make the glyph designer easier for the user? or is
    there some advantage to the method they use that a beginner like me hasn't noticed
    yet?\r\n"

  body: "I resisted drawing directly in FontLab for a long time, but once you get
    used to it, you realize it is particularly suited to drawing glyphs, and working
    directly in the program makes development go much faster. \r\n\r\nI used to draw
    in Illustrator and copy and paste into Fontographer. However, this method is not
    so straightforward with FontLab, a factor which kept me from moving up to FontLab
    for years. Now that I have become accustomed to (frankly, enamored of) FontLab's
    drawing tools, I can work much faster than I used to, mainly because there are
    fewer steps involved. The productivity gains were well worth the couple of weeks
    or so it took me to get used to using its tools.\r\n\r\nThere are font designers
    who work in Illustrator (or other drawing programs), but among those who do it
    for a living, I think it's the exception."
