  body: "Very very very nice!  I'm not entirely sure about the crossbar on the t,
    as it looks like it clashes with the serif on the v next door.  Perhaps f and
    g are similar.  Which reminds me, where's the lowercase u?\r\n\r\nBut a gorgeous,
    highly legible font.  I'm particularly fond of the jenson-y e and the tail on
    your a.\r\n\r\n--Jim K."

  body: "some things on first sight:\r\n\r\na: has a hangover to the left (top is
    a tad too long?)\r\nd: bottom right slightly too short/small. is the same part
    of \"a\" bigger?\r\ng: great :)\r\nh, m, n: serifs too long? somehow they look
    strange\r\nt: bar seems to be ok, i think it's a positioning problem between t/v\r\nz:
    slightly too heavy? Stroke-weight too indifferent?\r\n\r\nO: seems to be a bit
    goofy in the bottom part (moved slightly too much to the right side?)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
    overall, this looks very promising."
