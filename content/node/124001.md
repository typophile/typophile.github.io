  is from the Romanian version (i think), attached it because it has more characters.\r\n\r\nMore
  commonly seen in the english version like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aou
  font id_5356.JPG]\r\n\r\nThis font's non-italic variant was used in the AGE OF ULTRON
  comic book logo. Cropped and modded for character separation (badly, I know I didn't
  have better sources) here:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Capture_5701.JPG]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    to make some of the rounded corners square [img:sites/default/files/old-images/GhostClanEditedAsSUBSE_4742.jpg]
    Further editing would make a closer match.\r\nDon"
