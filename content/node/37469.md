  body: "I will assume that all you need is a font you can install on your Mac with
    \"Font Book\". You won't need X-windows or fontforge's graphic interface. I will
    also assume you installed fontforge directly from <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=103338\">sourceforge.net</a>.
    I will finally assume your shell is bash and that you don't know how to fix your
    Unix environment (I don't want to explain).\r\n\r\nNow, do this:  put all the
    <code>*.afm</code> and <code>*.pfb</code> (or <code>*.AMF</code> and <code>*.PFB</code>)
    \ files of the fonts you want to convert in the same directory. In that same directory,
    you will put two executable files, one named <code>convert</code>, the other named
    <code>pfb2otf</code> and call <code>convert</code> on all your font files. Here
    is a trick to do all that: in a terminal window you <code>cd</code> to the directory
    containing your font files; once you are there (when the Unix command <code>ls</code>
    lists your font files), you just paste in the terminal window (in one shot) the
    18 lines between the dotted lines:\r\n<code>\r\n-----------\r\ncat > convert <<
    'EOF'\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nPATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\r\nFONTFORGE_LANGUAGE=ff\r\nexport
    PATH FONTFORGE_LANGUAGE\r\n\r\nif (test -f $1); then ./pfb2otf $1; fi\r\nEOF\r\ncat
    > pfb2otf << 'EOF'\r\n#!/usr/local/bin/fontforge\r\nOpen($1);\r\nReencode(\"unicode\");\r\nGenerate($fontname+\".otf\");\r\nQuit(0);\r\nEOF\r\nchmod
    755 pfb2otf convert\r\nfor i in *.[pP][fF][bB]; do ./convert $i; done\r\n-----------\r\n</code>\r\nIf
    everything went ok, you should see\r\n<code>\r\nCopyright (c) 2000-2007 by George
    Williams.\r\n Executable based on sources from 17:57 15-Sep-2007.\r\n</code>\r\nas
    many times as you have font files.  When the processing is over, you start \"Font
    Book\" click on \"File > Validate File...\" and select the fonts you just generated
    (you can use Apple A to select them all). If the validation succeeds, your fonts
    should be ok to install. \r\n\r\nMichel\r\nPS Edited after posting\r\n"

    mere minutes \u2013 if you are familiar with the Terminal and Sourceforge.\r\n\r\nI'm
    sure that application mentioned in the second post will be a smoother way for
    anyone who does not regard his Mac OS as essentially a shiny Unix derivate (which,
    of course, it is). Just ignore the helpful hacker's arrogance there.\r\n\r\nEr,
    yeah, thanks Michel. This helped me a lot. Really.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
