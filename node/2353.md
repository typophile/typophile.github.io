  body: 'Mutek &#40;Music, Sound and New Technologies&#41; is a Montreal based festival.
    They also do international events and release cd compilations. <BR> <BR>You can
    have some info here : <a href="http://www.mutek.ca/" target="_blank">http://www.mutek.ca/</a>
    <BR> <BR>Regarding this logo, I believe that it&#39;s not made from a font. It
    was originaly created a couple years ago by a local designer and has been very
    slightly modified every year using a special grid. <BR> <BR>It may be inspired
    form a font, but I can&#39;t say which one. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not 100% sure about
    this answer. I hope someone will be able do confirm what I say. <BR> <BR>Good
    luck, <BR> <BR>jf'

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t believe the logo has changed over
    the past 4 years. <BR> <BR>What makes you think the designer &#34;modifies it
    every year using a special grid?&#34; <BR>

  body: Nice ! I&#39;m actually listening to your set on the website. I attend Mutek
    shows every year but I didn&#39;t have the chance to see you performing. <BR>
    <BR>Now, about the logo... <BR> <BR>To answer your original question, I contacted
    a friend of mine that is working on the graphic design for Mutek 2004 &#40;probably
    not the whole thing, but a part of it&#41;. He then asked his boss who said that
    he slightly changed the logo himself last year... not using a font but using a
    grid. I agree with you that the logo always looked like that, but I believe that
    there have been some minor changes. <BR> <BR>But again, I don&#39;t know who is
    the original designer. He/She might have been inspired by a font.

  body: Right on! Ya Mutek is great. My set on the website says it is a &#34;DJ&#34;
    set, but it is actually a &#34;LIVE&#34; set because it is all music that I made
    and played. <BR> <BR>On to font talk... <BR> <BR>Thanks for the info. I had my
    suspicions that it might be a custom job.
