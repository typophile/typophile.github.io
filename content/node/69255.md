    Typophile could give us some insight about these games."

    Live the Revolution!\r\nReds and Whites (I doubt the rules make it easy for the
    Whites ...)\r\nAerial Conflict\r\nAerial Combat (note: the letters going downward
    are part of the first\r\nword)\r\nCycling Race (?)\r\n\r\nA bit lower down: the
    one in greyish blue is something like 'Journey through Wealth'.\r\nI thought at
    first the city was burning, but it appears to a 'wealthy' industrialized city.
    Next, a similar theme: Electrification.\r\n\r\nI'll let someone else take over
    the translation from here."

    Orwellian that I had to follow the link. I think I stand corrected.

    in board games (I have a collection of several hundred board games myself), but
    it would have been both more modern (mostly 80s-present) and largely English language.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    They make sense for a country living post-revolutionary and post-war times. To
    view this as a caricature is to misunderstand their '20s and '30s reality.\r\n"

    This is so exciting!
