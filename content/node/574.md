  body: stop looking. :0 <BR>it&#39;s not a font, but a modification <BR>reverse oblique.
    <BR>It&#39;s close to Impact, but there are <BR>lots of similar looking faces
    in the <BR>Compacta vein. <BR> <BR>If you are unclear how to create that <BR>shadow
    effect, email me mr. squid. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: bj, is that a 3d perspective rendering, or just some illustrator/photoshop
    filter? <BR> <BR>I am curious now...

  body: If you draw in some construct lines like so... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/12774.gif"
    alt="vanishing point"> <BR> <BR>Its clear &#40;to me, perhaps wrongly?&#41; from
    the non-parallel lines that the type has been rendered in a 3D space rather than
    being &#34;fudged&#34; in Illustrator or Photoshop using 2D techniques. Then again,
    you can extrude and manipulate things into a genuine 3D space in Freehand MX,
    so it doesn&#39;t follow that its done in a 3D modeller. <BR> <BR>One thing is
    for sure, BJ is right - its highly unlikey to be a font, unless its one that consists
    solely of pairs of numbers rendered in space <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    revert to Illustrator 6 and take advantage <BR>of the genius of Kai Krause. <BR>
