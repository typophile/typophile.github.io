body: '{Commercial Announcement} <BR> <BR>After much delay I&#39;ve put up my collection
  of Baseline magazine back issues up for auction: <BR> <BR><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=4505740160"
  target="_blank">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=4505740160</a>
  <BR> <BR>I let me subscription lapse, and I can&#39;t justify buying all the issues
  since #37 to make my collection complete again&#42;, so I hope these content-rich
  and really well-crafted magazines find a good home. <BR> <BR>&#42; Issues before
  #10 being essentially impossible to find. Even #10 is extremely rare. <BR> <BR>If
  you bid, good luck. <BR>If you don&#39;t bid, please pass this along to other graphics/typography
  lists &#40;like Typo-L where I&#39;m no longer a subscriber&#41; - I&#39;d appreciate
  that. <BR> <BR>hhp'
