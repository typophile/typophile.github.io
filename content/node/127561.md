  \r\nI found the communication from Stephen Coles at ATypI 2017 but need some more
  information.\r\nDoes anyone here know any good articles on the subject that can
  point out?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nAnt\xF3nio Fonseca"

  body: "I'm writing a little article about the History of an old typography foundry.
    I found some old type specimens scattered around the world and I paid for their
    digitalization. However, these scans are almost always of insufficient resolution
    for the study of typefaces, mainly printed in small size (below 10pt). I wonder
    if anyone has thought about this problem and what solutions it has found.\r\n\r\nThank
    you\r\nAnt\xF3nio"

  body: "Maybe this will help.\r\nI use a digital microscope for imaging those small
    specimens; for larger type such as 18 point and above I use an 8mp digital camera
    in Macro mode. Then I do post-processing in Photoshop to achieve what I want to
    work with.\r\nI also only use specimens printed from original metal (hopefully
    not too worn) but none that have been reproduced by offset printing."

    paper/document/samples that you could share (you can PM) so I can see what is
    like to see those small typefaces viewed big?\r\n\r\nAF"

  body: "You may find Zapf\u2019s Palatino interesting. The original metal cut was
    actually quite lively and there\u2019s an incomplete digitalization (look for
    Palatino BQ). Then along came Linotype, digitalized Palatino and it seems that
    ever since we\u2019re stuck with a somewhat flat and limp version of the original
    metal cut. Sad, really... Not sure if this helps but it\u2019s a nice illustration\u2026"
