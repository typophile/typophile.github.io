body: "Looking to get some critique on a new logo for a client, World of Beer.  I
  am not formally trained in typography and graphic design, so I am unsure as to where
  to align the letters in \"World of Beer\". A couple questions...\r\n\r\n1. Should
  the \"W\" and the \"B\" sit slightly below the baseline because they are larger
  than the other letters?\r\n2. Should the \"o\" in \"World\" also sit slightly below
  (but still a bit higher than the \"W\" and the \"B\") because it has a rounded lower
  extent?\r\n3. I currently have the horizontal line below the \"World of Beer\" centered
  on the bottom left point of the \"W\" in \"World\" and the bottom right point of
  the \"R\" in \"Beer\". Is this correct? Should the right side of the line be aligned
  with the upper-right rounded part of the \"R\" in \"Beer\"? Should the left side
  of the line be aligned slightly to the left of where it is now?\r\n4. The clear
  space on the left and right sides around the logo is currently calculated from the
  edges of the horizontal line. I'm unsure if this is correct, as it currently looks
  a bit off. This might be corrected by adjustments made from answers to previous
  question.\r\n\r\nAny other comments and critiques are welcome. Thanks in advance
  for the advice.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJ.W."

  body: "Very nice article. Thank you. That pretty much answered my questions about
    the baseline. Does the fact that the \"W\" in \"World\" and \"B\" in \"Beer\"
    are much bigger than the other letters have any effect on where they should lineup
    in relation to the baseline? Should they be slightly below or directly on the
    baseline?\r\n\r\nI'm also still unsure about the horizontal alignment issue (#'s
    3&4).\r\n\r\nThanks again for the article."

    be on three more building fronts just this year, and 5 more in 2010 (based on
    what the franchise company has signed right now).  i know there are quite a few
    respected designers on this forum, so any critiques are welcome. thanks again
    for the help, j.w.

  body: "the client already had a logo with the exact same \"World of Beer\" but a
    different globe (some pretty cheesy stock art looking globe), and they wanted
    to stay with the same \"World of Beer\" part so they only had to replace the globe
    on the big sign on their building, instead of replacing the entire thing. So,
    the \"World of Beer\" part was not my design, just the globe. But it's not too
    late to change little aspects of it. I too have always thought that the \"of\"
    was just floating in mid-air. At this point, I don't think i'll be able to make
    a change as drastic as dropping it to the baseline, but i could make the \"o\"
    the same size as the \"f\" and align the top of them with the median line (see
    changes below). \r\n\r\nAnother person left a comment about the stroke weight
    needing to be uniform. I'm working on that right now. It's taking a little while
    b/c i dont actually have this particular font. I actually had to trace the old
    logo b/c all the client had was a TIFF file. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/worldofbeer_new_5930.jpg]"

    a *little* more breathing room between the letters. If all they're concerned about
    is their sign, with this logo get more exposure elsewhere? If the sign on the
    storefront is the only thing they don't want to change, there's little to no reason
    to not improve upon the original for all other applications while you have the
    opportunity.\r\n\r\nAgreed about Arial. One of the babillion American gothics
    might work really well here.\r\n\r\nFunny, while I write this I can see the logo
    peripherally while I look in the box I'm typing. The indirect image out of the
    corner of my eye interprets it as the Jurassic Park logo. Try it for yourself."

    do i ignore the serifs when spacing the letters? \r\n\r\nI agree with you about
    improving on the logo. The storefront is certainly not the only place where this
    logo will show up. As far as storefronts go, they currently have one store, but
    10 more locations are signed and scheduled to open in the next two years (with
    more to come i'm sure). In my opinion, now is the time to perfect this logo. Better
    to make the change now than two years from now.\r\n\r\nchecking out the babillion
    American gothics now.\r\n\r\nman, i haven't seen the Jurassic Park logo in years.
    I just checked it out, and it does look similar, especially when out of the corner
    of the eye. haha."
