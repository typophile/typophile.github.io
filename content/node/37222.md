  on a font or something? Im doing type treatments for some headings and would like
  to play with this font.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/man_typography_4652.gif]"

  body: My guess would be a somewhat clumsy font. The IV and W took a little time
    to make decipher and, while consistent with each other, don't bear much relation
    to the other characters. Also, why are the tops of the I and L angled differently
    from the other letters?

  body: "Oldnick: I have no idea why I & L are angeled differently from the other
    letters. Make no sense. But overall I think it's a very interesting font for headings
    and would be nice to play with it.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned I doubt it's a real font
    - but I still wondered if someone knew.\r\n\r\nIt's scanned from a swedish fashion
    magazine for Men called Man Magazine.\r\nhttp://www.manmagazine.se/   there you
    see 2007 in this font if that help anyone to figure out which font it is."

  body: It seems the angle is cut differently on the straight characters (I, L, H,
    etc) than on the curved characters (C, O, E, S) but that on this sample the I
    was flipped, which makes a nice ligature with the R but looks strange nevertheless.
