  agency website - http://icetemplates.com/shop/freddie-and-kristy-responsive-one-page-theme/\r\n\r\nBesides
  chaning over the content such as texts and imagery with the custom one, and getting
  rid of irrelevant design elements, we also need to have a contact form created,
  because there's none in the template and a few new pages added to showcase each
  type of service the agency provides, that is at least 4 new pages. \r\n\r\nThanks
  for your offers\r\n"
