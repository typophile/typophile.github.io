    target="new">FF NewYorkerType</a>, and I wouldn't know if this specific cut has
    been digitised.

  body: I believe the magazine may use a custom font called Irvin, but <a href="http://www.smackbomb.com/famousfonts/fonts/newyorker.html">Allen
    Walden</a> made his own digitization of the NY face.

  body: "This typeface has always interested me, so I took some trouble with this
    answer. The type the New Yorker uses is called 'Irvin' and you can see it on Page
    184 of McGrew's book on \"American Metal Typefaces of the 20th Century\".\r\n\r\nI
    know of three digital versions (there were at least two film type versions): FF
    New Yorker, which has been mentioned; 'Manhattan' which was sold by Franklin Type
    Founders (now available only at Atomic Type); and David Rakowski's digitization
    called 'Upper West Side' (free at typOasis). The last is the only one of the three
    that faithfully recreates the true 'Q' from Irvin (in version 1.3 which is at
    typOasis. Rakowski's earlier version also had a bogus Q).\r\n\r\nI have made and
    posted an image with the posted sample for this thread, shown with samples of
    each of the three digital versions. See http://bowfinprintworks.com/FaithFordType.html
    (Yves, when is image posting coming back? Soon, I hope!) Based on the W, I would
    say the Faith Ford card uses Manhattan.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I checked the Walden New Yorker font in detail, and I think the Walden version
    is a very slightly modified version of the early Rakowski font. The two Q's have
    identical shapes, but the Walden version uses more points. Since neither matched
    the original Q, this strikes me as more than odd.\r\n\r\nIn any case, neither
    of them was used for the Faith Ford card. I updated the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/FaithFordType.html\"
    target=\"new\">page I posted</a> to show a sample scanned from the McGrew book
    of Irvin as it existed in metal type form.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    to go with Manhattan. If anyone can recommend other sites for looking up fonts,
    it would be great.\r\n\r\nThanks Again!!"
