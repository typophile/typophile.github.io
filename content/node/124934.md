  by Wink Associates for Factory Records in Manchester UK circa 1997.\r\n\r\nMy research
  has thrown up \"SoftSoul Bold\" and \"Plakette Serial\" as the closest matches but
  while both are close in spirit they're not quite right.\r\n\r\nNote the unique shape
  of the \"s\" \"a\" and \"t\" characters.\r\n\r\nAll samples I have are lower case
  and I don't have any special characters or numbers.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nNeil\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_3525_5639.png]"

    its not a major task to edit FF Softsoul  to make a match.\r\nDon"

    Patrick Broderick of Rotodesign bequeathed a few of his fonts, including Omnivore,
    to Chank back around 2005. Here is a full specimen of Omnivore as part of the
