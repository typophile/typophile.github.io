body: "Not entirely a type question, but I reckon someone can offer good advice on
  this one. I'm about to have a business card printed for a client. We want it done
  in one color (black) on a matte paper. Thing is, we'd very much like the black to
  have a somewhat glossy look to it, almost like piano varnish. My printer gives me
  an outragous price because they have to use someone elses services to apply varnish.\r\n\r\nDo
  you have to apply varnish after the colour, or could it be mixed in with the ink?
  Does it have to be done in two steps, and if so: do you have any recommandations
  for a printer that does both? \r\n\r\n"

  body: Yo can silkscreen them in black rising ink. It is very glossy and rises about
    0,3 mm up from the paper. I had some handmade in Vietnam once. Very nice.

  body: Claus, is it precise enough for white text on black background? Who does these
    sort of jobs? (Og hva er det danske, evt. norske utrykket for dette?)

  body: I have no idea what happens when it's white ink on black stock. That ink might
    not be opaque enough. But in my case the text was sharp and crispy even in the
    small details. In Denmark those doing silkscreening is called 'serigrafi'. The
    ink I am talking about is not the 'puff-ink' that you see on apparel.

  body: "I intend to print black, not white. I know the term for silkscreening, I'm
    more curious to what black rising ink is called. Do you know of anyone who use
    it? Should I just contact someone doing silkscreening around here, perhaps? I
    guess I could run it by \u2019nam (though mailing might be expensive) \u2026"

    know if you find out please.

    be quite cheap.

  body: Frode, thermography can* be done with letterpress and offset as well (*I thought,
    could be wrong though)
