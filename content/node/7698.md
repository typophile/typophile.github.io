  body: I think you should make these into three separate posts, so each can be followed
    separately. <BR> <BR>The Serial number looks like either metal or a electro-mechanical
    printer type. Also, because it looks like something &#39;official&#39; like currency
    or government documents, I think it is our policy not to try to help reproduce
    it. I know it&#39;s my policy.

  body: The serial number is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/ocr-b/ocr-b/testdrive.html?s=T1112541120884&amp;p=48">OCR-B</a>,
    it&#39;s more or less common knowledge that it is used on all European passports
    and such.

  body: The two script examples appear to be hand-lettered. The C in the second one
    resembles <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/brush-script/" target="_blank">Brush
    Script</a>, but isn&#39;t.

  body: Micha looks something like a script called Spoleto, I think. Can&#39;t remember
    where it comes from, though.
