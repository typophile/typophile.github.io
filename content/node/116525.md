body: "From 17 May till 31 August 2014 projects of the <em>Expert class Type design</em>
  (EcTd) students will be exhibited at the Museum Plantin-Moretus in Antwerp. The
  EcTd course is offered by the Plantin Institute of Typography, which operates under
  the umbrella of the renown Plantin Society. The exhibition comprises work of students
  who successfully \uFB01nished the 2012\u20132013 course and a preview of the ongoing
  projects of the current 2013\u20132014 course. This is the third consecutive EcTd
  exhibition at the Museum Plantin-Moretus and the \uFB01rst one that is combined
  with the <em>Expert class Book design</em> course.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Geraert-revival_1_4644.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  displayed projects are as diverse as the students, of which many have \uFB01nished
  (multiple) bachelor or master studies in graphic design or in related subjects,
  and who all share a fascination for type (design) and typography. The subjects vary
  from an in-depth study of a renaissance typeface produced by Geraert van der Leye
  (latinised into Gerardus de Lisa when he moved to Italy) in the \uFB01fteenth century,
  resulting in a revival that clearly deviates from the \u2018Jenson-Griffo\u2019
  ones, to the development of a completely new present-day typeface. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/New_type_1_5513.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  between a revival is made based on punches, matrices and type of Robert Granjon
  in the collection of the Musem Plantin-Moretus, a technically and aesthetically
  impressive line-for-line redrawing of one of the cursive \u2018hands\u2019 of Jan
  van den Velde, a Dutch master-calligrapher from the seventeenth century, and typefaces
  based on writing with the broad-nibbed pen and \uFB02exible pointed pen are developed
  for for instance display purposes or for application in children books.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Granjon-revival_1_6111.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  EcTd course is a tough one, if only because the students have to combine the study
  with their daily work, which varies from graphic designing to lecturing. To investigate
  historic material, to explore the in\uFB02uence of writing tools on the shape, contrast
  and contrast-\uFB02ow, to draw type based on the outcomes of the research and to
  test different font tools cost a lot of time and effort. The quality displayed at
  the exhibition is therefore even more impressive.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VandenVelde_1_4507.jpg]\r\n\r\nHaving
  the EcTd course under the roof of what can be considered the \u2018Holy Temple of
  type\u2019, i.e., the Museum Plantin-Moretus, provides not only the best possible
  atmosphere but also the very unique opportunity to make direct use of the museum\u2019s
  exquisite collection of punches, matrices, cast type and prints for research purposes
  and revival projects. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EcTd_poster_6485.jpg]"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VdV_1_4639.jpg]\r\n\r\nJeroen Koning,
    who followed the EcTd 2012\u20132013 course, shows at the aforementioned exhibition
    the development of (DTL) VandenVelde, a digital version of the <em>Espagnola Bastarda</em>,
    which is a cursive \u2018hand\u2019 by Jan van den Velde (1568\u20131623). This
    is an extraordinary project, because instead of auto-tracing printed images from
    <em>Spieghel der Schrijfkonste</em> \u2013an instruction book for calligraphers
    published by VdV in 1605\u2013 Jeroen is tracing the original letters line for
    line. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VdV_2_4254.jpg]\r\n\r\nAn example
    of this time-consuming method is Jeroen\u2019s tracing of \u2018the hand with
    the quill\u2019, an illustration from <em>Spieghel der Schrijfkonste</em>, which
    is according to Jeroen \u2018<em>of unparalleled beauty</em>\u2019. This beauty
    was very well captured in the digital version (above and below). \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VdV_3_5429.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor
    the redrawing Jeroen uses the \u2018Width Tool\u2019 in Adobe Illustrator CC,
    which makes it possible to fully control the contrast and contrast-\uFB02ow of
    the curves. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VdV_4_3939.jpg]\r\n\r\nSubsequently
    the resulting vector lines were converted to outline vectors, which can be further
    enhanced in a font tool.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VdV_5_6096.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    resulting digital type is becoming highly impressive, as can be seen in the preliminary
    version below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VdV_6_5189.jpg]"

    the capital V in the last picture of your penultimate post for? It doesn't seem
    to go with any lowercase letter. Was it historically used like that?\r\n\r\nCan
    more work  be seen online? There are some very impressive designs here. I love
    the Geraert revival. I don't suppose it will become available as a typeface?"
