body: "Greetings.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use Anchor Attachments to position marks to
  base glyphs for an Indic font I'm creating with FontLab+VOLT.\r\n\r\nThe positioning
  of the mark works well and VOLT does provide a really nice interface to tune this
  perfectly well.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I run the feature through the Proofing Tool,
  there is a space after the base, presumably by the mark that is now attached to
  the base.\r\n\r\nI've tried this with 'Below-Base Mark Positioning' and 'Mark Positioning'
  features - the result is thesame.\r\n\r\nThe attached screen shot may help illustrate
  the problem.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any help or pointer.\r\n\r\n~ MUTHU\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Telugu_Anchor_Attachments_5182.png]"

  body: Are your marks zero width? Marks should have no advance width, and should
    be made that way in your font outline creation tool prior to work in VOLT.

    am also trying with a telugu font with VOLT. I adopted the Pothana2000 like glyph
    structure. In VOLT proofing tool I am getting the right ligatures etc. But on
    compiling and testing in Word or OO the letters are not forming. Can you help
