  body: "It seems to have a strong resemblance to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/compacta/|Compacta]],
    but the arms of the E are longer and there is more space within the G and S. Clipping
    off the ends of the strokes is the easy part. Bob Alonso's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/road-gothic/|Road
    Gothic]] also shows a lot of similarities, but is less squared.\r\n\r\n- Mike
