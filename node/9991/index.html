  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there, I have two older fonts I&#39;m trying to identify. The first is a sans serif used on many old industrial safety signs and still used by the Stonehouse Sign Company in Denver, Colorado. Picture example: <a href="http://www.stonehousesigns.com/apps/catalog/images/bde17.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.stonehousesigns.com/apps/catalog/images/bde17.jpg</a> <BR> <BR>The second font is a serif font I&#39;ve often seen in Western posters. Years ago, I found a version of it called &#34;Mooshy&#34;, though I doubt it is the original name. Every side of the letter is slightly concave, including the serifs. Picture example: <a href="http://www.hemingray.info/laughlines/images/laughlines3.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.hemingray.info/laughlines/images/laughlines3.jpg</a> &#34;Laugh Lines&#34; &#40;sorry for the poor images&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m interested in learning the names of both these fonts and purchasing them for personal use, if possible. Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Awesome, thank you! Okay, I shot the following email over to Stonehouse Signs: <BR> <BR>To Whom It May Concern: <BR> <BR>Hello, I have an odd question for your company, but I hope you can help me. For many years I&#39;ve noticed that your safety signs &#40;for example, the &#34;Danger&#34; and &#34;Caution&#34; signs&#41; use a fairly unique typeface. I was interested in learning more about this typeface. Did it originate from your company? Does it have a name? Is it commercially available, or is it unique to your company? <BR> <BR>Thank you advance for your time. I own several of your older signs and have always be interested in your company&#39;s products. <BR> <BR>Sincerely, <BR>Christian Willis <BR> <BR>...we&#39;ll see if they respond. They&#39;ll probably think I&#39;m crazy, heh.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Wow, I actually got a reply from them! In case any of you are interested in the &#34;Danger Font&#34; used on Stonehouse Signs,  here is the reply I received: <BR> <BR>Christian, <BR> <BR>Thanks for your interest in Stonehouse Signs. Your astute powers of observation have allowed you to verbalize what many people only sense subconsciously -- the unique look of a Stonehouse safety sign. <BR> <BR>The typeface you refer to was originally created by J.W. Stonehouse, the son of the founder. JW developed an artistic eye for layout and lettering as an itinerant sign painter in the late 1800s. We have named the typeface &#34;JW Stonehouse&#34; after its creator. The true original version is still in use today by Stonehouse Signs. It is not commercially available. <BR> <BR>Over the years, others have used similar type styles. Some even copied JW&#39;s characteristic &#34;foot&#34; on the letter &#34;R&#34;. The only truly accurate version of the JW Stonehouse typeface is the version used by Stonehouse Signs, Inc. <BR> <BR>The JW Stonehouse typeface began to surface around 1928, as evidenced in our Catalog #3. Many of the new signs added to this publication used &#34;JW Stonehouse.&#34; Prior to this, draftsmen at Stonehouse Signs used a typeface with &#34;clipped corners&#34; instead of arcs on the rounded letters. Catalog #1, printed in 1919, shows either the &#34;clipped corner&#34; typeface or the printer&#39;s standard typeface, with no evidence of &#34;JW Stonehouse.&#34; Interestingly, the &#34;clipped corner&#34; typeface uses the &#34;foot&#34; on the letter &#34;R,&#34; which was carried forward and incorporated into the JW Stonehouse typeface. <BR> <BR>In the 1940s, Stonehouse Signs standardized JW&#39;s typeface and began using it exclusively. In 1972, Stonehouse Signs became the first sign manufacturing company to use a computer-aided design system with a knife-cutting plotter. The system was built and programmed from scratch by Stonehouse. The new system used the JW Stonehouse font, painstakingly recreated in computerized form. This first generation computer font even used the original kerning tables. <BR> <BR>Again, thanks for your interest in our Company. Everyone who works here is proud of our rich history. It&#39;s great to know about others like you who share our interest. <BR> <BR>To find out more about J.W. Stonehouse, visit <a href="http://www.jwstonehouse.com" target="_blank">http://www.jwstonehouse.com</a> <BR> <BR>Sincerely, <BR> <BR>Stonehouse Signs, Inc. <BR>Jeff Stone, VP-Operations <BR> <BR> <BR>--- COOL!! -Christian</div>
