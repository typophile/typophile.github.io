  body: First one could be [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/amplitude|FB
    Amplitude]] Ultra and the second one as you said should be Repsol own corporate
    typeface simply called 'Repsol'.

  body: Adding some details to the 'Repsol' case. This font has been designed by [[http://www.fontsmith.com|Fontsmith]]
    and to me, looks like a customized (to what point?) version of their own [[http://www.fontsmith.com/fonts/fs-sinclair.cfm|Sinclair]].
