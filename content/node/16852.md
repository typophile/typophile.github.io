  Society of Typographic Arts (STA) is a Chicago based design organization originally
  started in 1927. It was the Chicago branch of the AIGA until it left that organization
  to become the STA. The STA sponsored an annual competition, the 100 show as well
  as several publications. They were also one of the organizations that founded ICOGRADA
  and hosted the 1978 conference. In 1989 the organization broadened its focus to
  include other areas of design and became the now defunct American Center for Design
  (ACD).\r\n\r\nIn 1990 some former members of the STA restarted the organization
  as the New STA with a primary focus on local and regional design issues. It holds
  an annual design conference and has sponsored a series of informal presentations
  by designers ,and events having to do with Chicago's design history. For the seventy-fifth
  anniversary three simultaneous exhibits were held: \"Fifty Years of Graphic Design
  in Chicago 1927-1977,\" \"Fifty Years of Chicago Graphic Design (1941-1991),\" and
  \"Seventy-Five Years of Graphic Design in Chicago.\" Images from those exhibits
  were later incorporated into an online archive.\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://sta.3st.com/main.php\r\n\r\nChicago
