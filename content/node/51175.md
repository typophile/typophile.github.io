body: "hello.\r\n\r\nmy design partner and i are working on a resume template for
  a client - requested to be edited in word. we designed in apple pages first, so
  we used helvetica neue (75 bold), opentype.\r\n\r\nnow, i use a PC, and when i use
  indesign, i can choose the 75 bold style. but in word, i cannot seem to find it.
  basically, our client and i cannot see the typeface now. so i know it's not a translation
  issue, it's just something wrong with either office, or word, or windows!\r\n\r\nanyone
  familiar with this issue? are we just SOL with using word?"

    If so, then you have an answer.\r\n\r\nYou know, I'd really love to use InDesign
    as a normal word processor, but it's too memory intensive. Some might say it's
    overkill, but there's no such thing as overkill when you're aware of spacing and
    other details. It exports your document to PDF smoothly as well."

    In that case you would have to choose the Regular style in Word and then press
    the Bold button. You would only see the Regular style in the font menu."

  body: In Word running under Windows, you won't specifically see "Helvetica Neue
    75 Bold," but you should see "HelveticaNeue," or something like that, in Word's
    font list (on my computer, it's HelveticaNeueLT Std). Apply the bold style of
    that.

  body: "i am not using a font manager. by answer, do you mean i SHOULD, or SHOULD
    NOT?\r\n\r\nalso, i don't see helvetica neue; i only see variations on it in the
    font list... black condensed, etc. but no \"regular.\"\r\n\r\nthoughts?\r\nbtw
    thanks for the help everyone."

    Not making any points about license violations, just that the font naming may
    be Mac-centric.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "Is it possible that InDesign installed the font somewhere other than the
    Windows font folder (c:\\windows\\fonts)?\r\n\r\nCan you post a screen cap, or
    a text list, of either (1)your font list as seen from inside Word, or (2) the
    fonts installed in c:\\windows\\fonts? Not the whole list, just in the alphabetical
    area where Helvetica should be showing up."

  body: "The file name that Uli specifies, as shipped from the font vendor (Linotype/Monotype,
    Adobe, or a reseller), would not produce the menu names you are seeing. Are these
    OpenType CFF (.otf) fonts, or OpenType TrueType (.ttf)?\r\n\r\nIf the former,
    the menu names are definitely messed up, and I'd bet somebody converted the fonts
    manually to OpenType using some utility, instead of getting well-made OpenType
    versions from the font vendor. I am suspecting that the Windows menu names and
    style links are messed up.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
