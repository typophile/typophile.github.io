  body: "So do you want:\r\n[A] a font that mimics the above graphic, or\r\n[B] are
    you looking to establish a brand font that works with the signature above? \r\n\r\nIf
    [B] then I would try to find something that compliments rather than matches. It
    would depend also on the type of work the person does. Some ideas: A typewriter
    font to reinforce a handmade charm, a modern sans serif to be fairly neutral and
    let the signature be the star, a classy didone for an upscale gallery feel, something
    that reflects the loops and ascenders of the signature in a simple sans.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps!"
