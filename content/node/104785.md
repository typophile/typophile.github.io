  body: "What I like about the name is the interactivity, as it were. The cottage
    owner was a keen wind surfer, so he would only be reading the name when there
    was no wind, otherwise he\u2019d be out on the lake. \r\n\r\nThat and the absence
    of a question mark, which would be wrong in a place name.\r\n\r\nMy guess is the
    letters were cut with a manual jig saw.\r\n\r\nI also like the way the letters
    are arranged on a wavy baseline, or have perhaps been blown by the wind, although
    if there is no wind they should perhaps be becalmed!"
