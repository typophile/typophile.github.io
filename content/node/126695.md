  example, all cap headlines with Tungsten Compressed by Hoefler.\r\n\r\nIf I want
  to track should I stick with the non-compressed version of the font? \r\n\r\nJust
  trying to avoid a typographic crime, any suggestions? I've heard never to track
  out condensed type."

    leg of lamb is a very effective defence.
