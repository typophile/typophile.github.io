  Project]].\r\n\r\nFirst one by [[http://richardsmith.posterous.com/dollar-redeign-michael-tyznik|Michael
  Tyznik]]. I'd like to know the font for numerals: '20', '50' (Trade Gothic?) and
  the font used for 'Twenty dollars', 'Fifty dollars'. I know they're easy, but I
  can't figure them out.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20_obverse_final_3622.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/50_obverse_final_4684.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond
  one by [[http://richardsmith.posterous.com/dollar-redeign-michelle-haft|Michelle
