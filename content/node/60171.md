  body: "I am searching Mac McGrew's book on \"American Metal Typefaces of the 20th
    Century\" and the closest I have found so far is one called Slimline by Sol Hess,
    for Monotype in 1939. It has several alternate letters, including the same style
    'A' and 'a', but the E has no middle serif, The K legs are wrong, and other details
    are not the same. \r\n\r\nStill searching.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "That was the most similar typeface I found. Hess also did a series of Stymie
    Condensed faces that had many of the same letter structures, such as the A, a,
    K, R, W and y, but the main difference from your sample is that the sides of the
    round letters like O and G were not flattened.\r\n\r\nWas your sample European?\r\n\r\n

    The closest digital font I can think of offhand is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/attower/|PL
    Tower Condensed]], but several lower case letters are the wrong forms (a, g, y,
    for example).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Red Rooster's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/pall-mall-rr/|Pall
    Mall]] is also similar, and structurally matches more letterforms (except the
    'a'), although it is not a monotone type like your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
