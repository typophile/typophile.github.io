  it&#39;s about Gotcha. <BR> <BR>I read the threads for Al Nadeem, Gotterball, Stamps

  site &#40;<a href="http://www.identityworks.com/tools/" target="_blank">http://www.identityworks.com/tools/</a>&#41;,
  and helped me a lot to generate and find names. <BR> <BR>This is so far what I got

  work? What suggestions do you have?  I had the idea of a soldier for the logo, but
  maybe that&#39;s too generic or overused <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: Gen, welcome to typophile. <BR>A few questions. The logo is &#39;about Gotcha&#39;?
    What does this mean?  <BR>Do you mean Gotcha, the surfwear company? <BR>And what
    is your assignment, to come up with a fictitious business name <BR>and design
    a logo? <BR>Need more information to be helpful. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Hi bj harvey, it&#39;s about Paintball, the game, haven&#39;t noticed that
    there&#39;s a surfwear company. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen both names being used,  <BR>which
    one is more common? Gotcha or Paintball?

  body: Oh. Wasn&#39;t sure what you meant. <BR> <BR>As far as the marks ... hmmm,
    well you mentioned the Gutterball <BR>thread, in which our friend Jay W. pointed
    out that a mark ought <BR>to be more distinctive than simply typing a company
    name <BR>in a specific font. Sometimes this is difficult b/c of time constraints.
    <BR>But it sounds like you have some time before your classes start, yeah? <BR>
    <BR>I would humbly suggest that you select a name from your group <BR>and play
    around with some sketches, just paper and pencil. <BR>That is always a good starting
    point. You might try both uppercase  <BR>and lowercase, or mixed; you might try
    different <BR>forms of a specific letter; you might try different type classifications.

  body: Is it better to choose one and start from there? <BR>Or is it better to &#34;play&#34;
    with two or three and then choose? <BR> <BR>sorry if sometimes I sound a little
    harsh or coarse, english is not my native language. <BR> <BR>thanks.

  body: Yeah, it&#39;s a shame to give some a word mark or logo that is just  <BR>a
    font.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s kind of like Apple&#39;s corporate use of straight &#40;non-custom&#41;  <BR>Myriad.
    Any third party that wants to look like Apple can now  <BR>simply use Myriad and
    they&#39;re aligned to their brand.

  body: Maybe it&#39;s just a USA thing, but I am much more familiar with &#34;paintball&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>I was thinking the surf brand, too. &#40;Maybe we&#39;re just showing
    our age...&#41; <BR> <BR>I would think choosing the name would help a lot in defining
    your starting point. On the other hand, you might find a font you like, and choose
    a name based on letterforms that look good... but in  a real life project, you
    would most likely have the constraint of a company name already in place &#40;not
    to mention lots of other things that the client probably thinks they want...&#41;
    so I&#39;d pick the name first. <BR> <BR>One logo idea that comes to mind is &#34;Gotcha&#34;
    with a paint splat for the &#34;o&#34;. But, if the sport itself is known as &#34;Gotcha&#34;,
    that name might be ruled out as too generic. <BR> <BR>to JP - if Apple uses Myriad
    unaltered, why do they have it as a custom font, MyriadApple&#34;? I would imagine
    they have done <i>something</i> to it...

  body: Hi, you&#39;re right, it would definitely help a lot choosing one. <BR> <BR>In
    this past days haven&#39;t got much time to work in this, did as bj said, lots
    of sketches, and I thought about using Voom, and came with a logo, but a teammate
    is more in favour of Reiken. I&#39;ll think Reiken will be the name, and start
    from there. <BR> <BR>Visited the Gotcha &#40;surfwear&#41; site, duh! I&#39;ve
    completely forgotten about that company! <BR> <BR>The term Gotcha &#40;referring
    to paintball&#41; seems to be more used out of the States, indistincly, but yes,
    it&#39;s generic.  <BR> <BR>Well, I&#39;ll keep you informed about how this goes,
    thanks!
