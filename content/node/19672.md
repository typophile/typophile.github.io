  a certain typeface is used for a masthead, should it be reused for all other headers
  and title pages within the magazine, but like in differnet fonts such as bold, condensed
  etc? Add to that, should the same typeface be used throughout the whole magazine
  (for headers, title pages, body copy etc) or should they vary depending on the article
  subject?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I would be thankful if you could give out a few suggestions
  for a typeface/s to be used for a food magazine. Masthead, title pages, body copy
  etc. I'm hoping to achieve a modern/in-style comtemporary look with the magazine,
  and would like the type to really help it shine. The photography will also be nicely
  done.\r\n\r\nIt's for a student project, and so any help/advice given would be much
  appreciated. Thanks."

  body: "In my opinion The masterhead should a unique piece... treated pretty much
    like a logotype. Also I would never use the same typeface for both headlines and
    body copy. Better then to pick some typeface suited best for its purpose. That
    would give an optimal use and display of both typefaces, I think. Some suggestions:\r\n\r\nHeadlines:
    SOPHISTO - STALEMATE - LUMINANCE - REMONTOIRE - OXTAIL\r\n\r\nBody copy: DELICATO
    - ANZIANO - TAROCCO\r\n\r\nSee for yourself; http://www.macrhino.com\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

  body: Rotis and all its many varitions are good used with each other. Also many
    of typefaces from Hoefler & Frere Jones are really good choices- too many select.
    Trade gothic or news gothic used with Rotis

    I don't think that there are any \"right\" or \"wrong\" answers to your first
    two questions... I'm sure that there are (or have been, or will be!) real-life
    examples of the different options you are asking about... These are design decisions,
    and they in turn should be informed by your research and documentation on other
    magazines, not to mention trying different things out for yourself to see what
    works for you, etc. For example, take some dummy text and make a spread for your
    proposed magazine, using the same face for everything, then duplicate it and try
    varying the weights, or the fonts... Print everything out and compare the results..."
