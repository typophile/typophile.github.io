  body: "As for the logotype for _laura mercier_, it  looks like a modified version
    of neue Helvetica\xAE Std 27 Ultra Light Condensed http://www.fonts.com/font/adobe/neue-helvetica/27-ultra-light-condensed.
    Main difference is that _a_ has had is tail clipped. A classic example of logo-making
    101 -- take a retail font, clip something from a letter and cash a big cheque.\r\nDon"
