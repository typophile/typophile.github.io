  that there are art director types hanging out here, I thought that any responses
  would be from the kind of people I'm looking for (I'm the art director). \r\n\r\nWe
  are a well-known International publishing company looking for two full-time people
  with at least 3 years experience designing for magazines (this is in the field,
  not in school) for a media magazine redesign. You should have an expert knowledge
  of Indesign CS2 and be competent with Photoshop, Illustrator and Mac OS X. You should
  have expert typographic skills and a know how to create compelling page layouts
  while maintaining a strict and often tight schedule.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, there
  are two positions:\r\nAssistant Art Director\r\nGraphic Designer\r\n\r\nBilingual
  a plus for the designer position, essential for the AD.\r\n\r\nSalary is attractive
  and both jobs have benefits.\r\n\r\nEdit: I'm an idiot - here's my contact email:

  body: I should have mentioned that this position would require the person live in
    the city since it's a monthly and during production, it's full-on madness.

  body: Candidates would have to be permanent residents at least (our Photo Editor
    is a French expat with perm res status). Well Spafax definitely hires people from
    anywhere in Canada (and they do often) but you'll have to see if Air Canada will
    let you take your TV and couch onto the flight :P
