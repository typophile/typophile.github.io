  to have Akzidenz-Grotesque by LINOTYPE. This is a discontinued font. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  trying to get if on behalf of a friend who is doing a marvelous job in creating
  non Western fonts for academic work. <BR> <BR>Here is what he wrote to me: <BR>
  <BR>............ <BR>As far as the Akzidenz-Grotesk is concerned, I need only ONE
  example of ANY font alled &#34;Akzidenz-Grotesk&#34; and contained in any disk or
  CD from &#42;&#42;Linotype&#42;&#42;. The important point is: <BR>The file must
  be from &#42;&#42;Linotype&#42;&#42;, not from Berthold etc. <BR>This means, if
  someone has ANY older Linotype Library Gold CD on which the Akzidenz-Grotesk is
  contained, then I would need ONE example, preferable the Roman style of Akzidenz-Grotesk.
  <BR>Since Font Explorer 1.5 Gold Edition = Linotype Library Gold CD the Akzidenz-Grotesk
  was no longer sold by Linotype, so that it must be a Linotype font collection older
  than year 2000. <BR>............... <BR> <BR>Since it is a discontinued font, I
  think there is no problem in his getting it. If someone can send such a copy it
  would be appreciated.  <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think this is breaking whatever law
  there is, but then I&#39;m not a lawyer. I mean to offend no one&#39;s feelings
  on this hot matter. But just bear in mind that the person on behalf of which I&#39;m
  asking this is doing extremely important academic work: providing fonts for working
  with old and very important texts.  <BR> <BR>I hope I will not be missinterpreted.  <BR>

    <BR>The fact that the font under the particular name and in a particular version

  body: 'Dear Adam; <BR> <BR>Yes, perhaps that is illegal. But surely there would
    have been an impasse here: if it were discontinued how could one buy it? For someone
    who has it and after selling would keep a copy? <BR> <BR>And what about, for instance,
    the old Berthold fonts? Berthold, as far as I know, went bankrupt. If I wish to
    have a Berthold font is it illegal to someone to give it to me? Perhaps it is,
    but how could one get it in such a case? <BR> <BR>I understand the need to pay
    for fonts. I purchased a lot of them. I won&#39;t just pilfer them. But in the
    case I presented, I believe I am doing nothing ethically &#40;as distinct from
    legally&#41; wrong. <BR> <BR>This, of course, is open to debate, but I follow
    ethics, not blind law. Law is meant to further ethics, but it is not ethics. When
    law is blatantly wrong &#40;as in the case of Berthold fonts, should it decree
    that I am not at liberty to copy it&#41; I am quite willing to break it, as I
    am doing no harm to anyone.  <BR> <BR>Dear Thomas: <BR> <BR>No, I think he really
    needs the Akzidenz-Grotesk as a bases to make foreign alphabets. Anyway, I don&#39;t
    exactly know, or am not sure I am at liberty to say, but it seems to me to be
    a worthy cause.  <BR> <BR>Let me assure you that by stating what I believe is

    use? <BR> <BR>I see no moral reason why this should not be the case.

    This is not much different from buying a car or a set of dishes that is no longer

    <BR> <BR>As for using the font as a basis for making new fonts, unfortunately
    most licenses prohibit modifying the font that has been licensed. I gather Linotype&#39;s
    is in that category. So even if it were still available from Linotype, your friend
    couldn&#39;t do what he wants with it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not a lawyer of course,
    but these things seem like pretty clear violations of license agreements and copyright
    laws in most of the world. People are entitled to whatever opinions they want,
    but as far as I know legal systems do not generally recognize having a different
    opinion as a basis for breaking the law or violating a contract. <BR> <BR>Regards,

  body: Rodrigo, I&#39;m sorry to say that would you are asking for would be a EULA
    violation. Linotype Akzidenz Grotesk, as Adam pointed out, was never discontinued.
    The font files were just renamed. <BR> <BR>Someone who has purchased a Gold CD
    from Linotype may not sell, or give individual font files to anyone else for any
    reason that is not delineated in their EULA &#40;so, anything other than co-workers
    or service bureaus, etc.&#41;. That would be a EULA violation.  <BR> <BR>One the
    other hand, If someone had bought the old Akzidenz or new Basic Commercial as
    an &#34;individual font file&#34; from our web shop, they could transfer that
    license to you or to your friend, but they could not just give you the font. They
    would have to delete their own copy then as well. Anything else would be both
    illegal and immoral, because you would be getting something that you didn&#39;t
    rightfully pay for. <BR> <BR>Linotype Akzidenz Grotesk and Basic Commercial will
    remain licensed products of Linotype&#39;s parent company Heidelberger Druckmaschinen
    AG as long as Linotype and/or their parent company exist as coprporate entities.
    <BR> <BR>Berthold Types in Chicago holds itself to be the legal successor company
    of H. Berthold AG. So, if you acquire an old Berthold font illegally, the new
    Berthold Types could still be justified in pursuing you as far as I know, because
    you WOULD be violating a EULA condition of their&#39;s, even if don&#39;t believe
    it! <BR> <BR>Rodrigo, I would encourage you, or your friend, to just buy a copy
    of Basic Commercial from Linotype! A single weight just costs $22. Surely that
    isn&#39;t too much to pay for such a renowned design. <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/114/basiccommercial-family.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com/114/basiccommercial-family.html</a> <BR>
    <BR>That your friend only want to use the font for private or academic pursuits
    is unfortunately not a factor in purchasing decisions. You need to purchase a
    license for a font in order to use it on your computer, not just to create commercial
    work for clients. <BR> <BR>I work at Linotype, and would be happy to answer any
    more licensing questions that you might have. You can contact me at any time offline,
    if you&#39;d like.

    Being cool encourages compliance. <BR> <BR>I know &#34;font collectors&#34; --
    at least one of which is a regular here, and I&#39;m not talking about me -- who
    seek out multiple &amp;/or obsolescent variants of fonts for their collection.
    Say, Myriad MM -- they have no intention of ever using said font, they just want
    it. If they were to use a font in their collection for commercial work, they would
    immediately purchase a license. <BR> <BR>That, in my opinion, is completely harmless
    -- and in fact <i>promotes</i> licensing in a try-before-you-buy sort of way.
    Trying to suppress that sort of activity is pointless and self-defeating. As the
    music industry has discovered, it is absolutely impossible to stop without liberalizing
    their business model or launching a few thousand lawsuits. <BR> <BR>I know this
    is rehashing old arguments, but this discussion highlights what I think are some
    of the more unreasonable aspects of the EULA structure. <BR> <BR>Being overly
    strict just drive people to Kazaa and Limewire, where they can download the Font
    Folio &#40;or whatever&#41; any time they want.

    unpurchasable typeface. <BR> <BR>The Tiro Typeworks&#39; Type 1 retail fonts --
    1530 Garamond, Manticore, Aeneas, Academia -- <i>are</i> unpurchasable typefaces,
    so may make a useful example in discussion. We have withdrawn these fonts from
    the market and have no immediate plans to rerelease them in any format, so they
    will remain unpurchasable for some time, perhaps forever. Does this mean that
    people who have licenses for these fonts can share the fonts with other people
    in contravention of the original license agreement? No, it does not. The sale
    of the fonts has been discontinued, not the terms of existing license agreements.
    These fonts are the intellectual property of the designers, who have a moral and
    legal right to determine how, when and <i>whether</i> they are distributed. The
    fonts have been withdrawn from distribution for a reason: we don&#39;t want to
    sell them any more because we don&#39;t want them to be more widely used than
    they already are. If withdrawing them from distribution meant that anyone could
    freely pass them around, what would be the frigging point of withdrawing them?
    I take a very strict view on these unpurchasable typefaces.'

    corresponds to reality, to treating fellow humans decently.</i> <BR> <BR>Well,
    that seems a basic function of typical legalese. I went to some length to write
    the old Tiro EULA in plain English and to stress the ways in which respecting
    the EULA protected the user&#39;s investment, which is among other things an investment
    in the value of something that not everyone else has. <BR> <BR><i>Because a few
    months ago when I claimed that only MS had such a clause, Simon pointed out that
    in fact most houses had it &#40;at that point&#41;.</i> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t recall
    Si saying that most font houses have this clause. In any case, I don&#39;t think
    it has ever been the case. Many font houses follow Adobe&#39;s lead, which has
    always been to allow modification. <BR> <BR>What I do recall Si saying, which
    is also the point I have made whenever the MS EULA comes up, is that,  excepting
    the rather special and generous case of the web fonts, MS <i>do not have a EULA
    for fonts</i>. Fonts distributed by MS are covered by the EULAs of the software
    packages with which they are bundled. The no-mod clause applied to fonts is simply
    that of the prohibition on decompiling or reverse engineering of the operating
    system, word processor, or what-have-you software. Microsoft, until now at least,
    have not singled out fonts in their software EULAs. <BR> <BR>I think it is important
    to distinguish between fonts that are licensed directly in a retail market, and
    fonts that are bundled with software. I think the no-mod clause makes a lot of
    sense in the latter case, whether fonts are singled out in the EULA or not. MS
    is not a &#39;font house&#39; in the sense that even Adobe is, let alone Agfa
    Monotype, Linotype, Emigre, House Industries, Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones, etc.

  body: If the point of no-mod clauses is to stop an intermediatory &#40;pardon my
    spelling&#41; from corrupting a font to be passed on to an end user, then why
    not simply put a no-mod clause in the contract with the intermediatory, and let
    the end user modify &#40;such as adding Welsh support to a typeface&#41; as they
    wish for their own needs? Why not tell people that you wont support the fonts
    if they are modified, rather than banning modification? <BR> <BR>If I buy a car
    and mess with the engine, I&#39;d accept that it&#39;d invalidate my warranty.

    It reduces the times clients have to go <i>back</i> to the maker to ask for mods,

    to me both of those are [generally] unreasonable, because: #1 is beyond the decent

  body: Since the modification issue popped up here, here&#39;s a &#40;maybe stupid&#41;
    question for all the experts who have posted in this thread.  <BR>When saying
    that you cannot modify a font, that means exclusively modifying the font files?
    An example - if I write something in a vector software &#40;Illustrator, Freehand,
    whatever&#41; using such a protected font, then transform it to oulines and edit
    that outline, am I breaking the no-modification clause?  <BR>Just curious.

  body: Well, but I don&#39;t get it then. In terms of intelectual property or authoring,
    I don&#39;t see the reason for one being allowed to modify the font shape but
    not the software. Although I understand it may generate the mentioned problems
    &#40;corrupted files, problems with customer service, etc&#41;, but that&#39;s
    not author&#39;s protection, just avoiding annoyance. <BR>As in the link Hrant
    posted. The girl was violating MS&#39; user agreement just by modifying the font;
    the fact that she opened the file and edited it &#40;because she wanted to tweak
    some letters&#41; was a crime, right? Even if she if she would never use  it,
    be it personally OR commercially. <BR> <BR>But if she had set all her text in
    the same font, created outlines out of it and edited the outlines to fit her needs,
    then she would be able to do anything and would be not breaking the agreement?
    <BR> <BR>What, then, is being protected?

  body: John, can you answer this? You could definitely word it better that I can.
    <BR> <BR>Gabriel, most type foundries, at least the large ones, allow you to modify
    fonts anyway as long as you don&#39;t try to sell them to anyone else as you own
    work. So, this question isn&#39;t an enormous factor in the industry anymore.
    <BR> <BR>What is protected is the data that makes font work. Once you are using
    the font legitimately for its intended purpose &#40;designing in a computer application&#41;,
    you can do pretty much whatever you want with it. That is fair use. <BR> <BR>Thinking
    about fair use is a good topic for further discussion.

    the information which Nathan and I had gathered changes were occuring. This was
    last year &#40;October-January&#41;. I like to think that some changes came about
    because of my little essay. But mostly I&#39;m just happy that the conversation
    was happening. Designers should not be afraid to voice their concerns with EULAs.
    But, at the same time designers need to respect the EULAs.

  body: Further, if you buy ITC Bodoni from Myfonts, you are given the Linotype license
    you refer to, and it allows read-only embedding AND design mods, while Stone Type&#39;s
    EULA does not allow modifications! <BR> <BR>I should note that ITC&#39;s site
    includes smallcaps in the albeit higher price, while the other vendors do not,
    so that&#39;s a trade off one has to make against their EULA. <BR> <BR>Still,
    I think the End User might be justified in feeling a little cheated if he purchased
    form Stone or Linotype. The limitations of the EULA aren&#39;t exactly featured
    when browsing for type, and one could easily slip up and buy from the wrong place.
