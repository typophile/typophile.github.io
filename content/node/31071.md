  anybody out there that can tell me what the font the Dutch 'Postbank' concern uses
  in their visual identity and advertisements? I have whatthefonted it, googled it...
  but I really have no idea. No doubt, this is a custom font, but who designed it?
  Are there any fonts similar to this?"

  body: Superb, thanks a lot! ;) I guess we can close this with Postbankface by Theo
    Klooster then. What an awful site, that man has. However, since this is very impossible
    to attain, does someone know of a font with such curves? Notice the superb 'k'
    and those nice stems.
