body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI'm working on a book in InDesign CS3.\r\nIt has 20 chapters
  and i'm using two master pages, one for numbered pages and another for unumbered
  pages.\r\nI want two use a header with the chapter name for each page of that chapter.
  How can i do that? I thought in using 20 child masters (being the numbered master
  the parent) for each chapter but in seems to me that adding so many masters isn't
  the right way to do it.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help i'll appreciate it\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\nRegards"

  body: "There's a way to do this without a bunch of \"children.\" It's similar to
    the way you insert an automatic folio on a master page.\r\n\r\nOn your Master
    pages, when you set up your running head (or foot or whatever), in the text frame
    where you want your folio and running head, use Text > Insert Special Character
    > Auto Page Number to insert a folio placeholder and Text > Insert Special Character
    > Section Marker to insert a running head placeholder.\r\n\r\nWhat you'll see
    is a letter (or number) equivalent to your Master Page prefix standing in for
    your folio and the word \"Section\" standing in for your chapter head. Format
    these placeholders as desired.\r\n\r\nThen you want to set the first page of each
    chapter as the start of a new section and in Numbering & Section Options... input
    your chapter name in the Section Marker field. \r\n\r\nThen the \"Section\" placeholder
    on your master page(s) will be replaced with the contents of Section Marker field
    for every page of that section.\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense without visuals
    and accomplishes what you're after.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
