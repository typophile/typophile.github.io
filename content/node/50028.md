  body: "Rene, I'm surprised that no one has tried to answer this one. I thought it
    looked like something I had seen, but just couldn't recall where. The strong diagonal
    stress of the C, G and presumably the O, should ring some bells for someone here.
    I have a feeling that this is an old font that has been in a lot of budget collections,
    but is not offered by any major foundry. Something like Opti or Brendel perhaps,
    but not places that design their own fonts.\r\n\r\nAny ideas? \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    couldn't find it a Dafont, and for some reason I also thought T-26, but it wasn't
    among the T-26 collection at MyFonts. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    but no.. cant find it.\r\nFor this moment im using a different font for the word
    Carpets and the STG i just drawn in Illustrator.\r\nStill looking for it, because
    its a beauty ;) Tnx again.\r\n\r\nRene"

  body: "Ren\xE9, I thought this reminded me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/romic-sh/|Romic]]
    in a heavy weight, but that is the closest in appearance that I have been able
    to locate. \r\n\r\nI still think I have seen this before, but I searched Veer
    (no luck), T-26 at their site (no luck), the Solotype Catalog (no luck), and even
    the old Precision Type catalog -- nothing.\r\n\r\nI know this one is going to
    make me crazy, because I think it is a font, and I think I have seen it before,
    but I am running out of ideas where to search for it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Sorry. Romic was the face that came immediately to mind. When that proved
    way off, I jumped to Seagull. Nope. From there, I too went through the Solotype
    Catalog, then the 8th VGC Catalog and the Phil's Fonts catalog. I don't have a
    Letraset catalog and, so, am out of ideas.\r\n\r\nI share your frustration, Mike.
    It looks like something I should know, but ..."

    was Romic (as previously mentioned) and Le Robur Noir, which has a similar 'A'

  body: "Thanks Mike & Lex for looking.  I am starting to get crazy enough that I
    was looking to see if there was a way to modify the C and G in [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-korinna/|Korinna]],
    and modify other letters from that font to make something similar to this. I think
    there are some heavier weight versions by other names in the Brendel & FontBank
    collections, but I don't have time at the moment to play around with this. If
    I had to re-create this from another font, I think I might try it that way, but
    it could get ugly.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
