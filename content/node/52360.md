  Download, 10,000 commercial-licensed free fonts for $20.\r\n\r\n[link removed by
  moderator]\r\n\r\nI need fonts for commercial purposes, but this sounds too good
  to be true.  Does anyone know if this is legitimate or just a scam?  It appears
  to the endorsement of at least one maker of free fonts.  \r\n\r\nThanks."

    find similar collections for $5.00. And it\u2019s not legit, because some of those
    fonts might be free, but their licenses do not allow them to be redistributed
    for profit.  \r\n\r\nAnd when I was a student I once made this mistake of buying
    one of these packs. What I got a was massive zip file filled with junk fonts,
    many of which had names like 000_001_a.ttf. Most of them were the dregs of the
    free font scene; bad, unfinished undergraduate font projects based on album cover
    and movie poster lettering. So unless you want to spend more money on software
    that can print out a specimen book of all the fonts, don\u2019t bother. "

    free, but their licenses do not allow them to be redistributed for profit.</em>\r\n\r\nThis
    is an incorrect assumption. I know a little about this Ultimate Font Download,
    enuff to tell you all the collection is perfectly legitimate. All of the fonts
    in it are in it by formal arrangement with their makers, who gave their permission
    for their work to be included. The guy who offers the download pays most of the
    profit he makes back to the people who made the fonts in the collection.\r\n\r\n@Nachos:
    <em>Don\u2019t get ripped off. 1001 fonts has these same fonts listed verbatim.</em>\r\n\r\nNo,
    it really doesn't work that way. People who buy The Ultimate Font Download are
    paying for the convenience of not having to wade thru page after page of drek
    on archive sites to find the good stuff. If you don't think paying a small sum
    of money for one handy download is worth it, that's your opinion. Thousands of
    satisfied buyers of the Ultimate Font Dowload disagree with you. Calling it a
    rip-off is like painting it black because you don't see the value of it in dollars.\r\n\r\nThere's
    no pleasing some peeple.\r\n\r\n<em>What would you bet that Larabie is getting
    a cut of profit from ultimatefontdownload?</em>\r\n\r\nYes, correct, Ray does
    recieve a cut of the profit from The Ultimate Font Download. If you have a problem
    with that you should talk to Ray larabie about it.\r\n\r\n@Darrel: <em>You can
    download all the quality free fonts in about a half hour.</em>\r\n\r\nCan you?
    You sound very shure. Have you actually done this?\r\n\r\n<em>There\u2019s maybe
    2 dozen, total, that are worth the effort of grabbing in terms of being a quality
    face, and versatile beyond the one-off parody of a movie title or band name.</em>\r\n\r\nAgain
    you sound so shure of this. Have you gone thru the entire collection and checked?
    What makes a font useful is subjective. Ray Larabie alone has made more than a
    dozen very useful, usable free fonts, and they are all in this collection. Add
    to that all the other useful usable fonts in it. Go figure.\r\n\r\n@phrostbyte64:
    <em>All of these comments are true, as far as they go.</em>\r\n\r\nIncorrect.
    Some of these comments are way off the mark.\r\n\r\n<em>As for being legit? Who
    knows.</em>\r\n\r\nI happen know that the fonts in this collection are as legitimate
    as free fonts can be.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "Nachos: What's your point?\r\n\r\nAluminum: check the EULA on those fonts
    you spent a few minutes collecting. How many allow commercial use or even contain
    a EULA that makes any sense?\r\n\r\nInnovati: If a designer were asked to create
    a sign for a cowboy themed amusement park ride, would Rockwell or Helvetica be
    the best choice? Helvetica seems a bit more cowboyish than Rockwell but I'm not
    sure. Please explain.\r\n\r\nThe Ultimate Font Download is Jason Nolan's project,
    he also runs 1001freefonts.com. All of the designers involved in the project have
    given their permission to include their fonts in the package. Jason is the most
    generous person I have ever encountered  . . . in my life . . . period. While
    other free fonts sites rake in the bucks and contribute zero dollars back to the
    designers, Jason shares the wealth. I don't want to say how much Jason has given
    back on a public forum but it's a hell of a lot. The fonts in the ultimate download
    have all been cleared, by the original designers for commercial use. So, you can
    say what you want about the wisdom of using free fonts, but don't say anything
    bad about this package. As far as the other download packages which contain my
    fonts go: they don't have my permission, they have out of date fonts and they
    give nothing back. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nYes, other sites have
    free fonts and you can buy lots of giant mega font packages elsewhere, some may
    even be free. You can go to various free fonts sites to find an old version of
    a font, probably with the EULA missing. If you have the time to spare and you
    don't mind old versions, go ahead. Do to dafont and have a grand old time downloading
    out of date versions of my fonts if you like.\r\n\r\nBut, even if you're a high
    end design snooty designer who won't touch a font under $50, it doesn't hurt to
    have some spare ammo. Plus, you get a heap of Nick's Fonts, licensed for commercial
    use. You can slag Larabie Fonts all you like but what do y'all have to say about
    Nick's fonts? Junk?\r\n\r\nI can see why some people are mistrustful. James Puckett,
    has good reason to avoid another too-good-to-be-true font deal. But, Jason's the
    real deal. I'm pretty certain any other download pack which contains my fonts
    is a scam."

    etc, or i had to deal with incomplete charater sets, but i did learn a lot about
    how to handle type by doing that.\r\n\r\nnow, i don't care how much a fonts costs

    there is Octin***, which i bought the whole pack for, but only really use the
    Vintage flavour and really love. \r\n\r\nwhile i really love using extensive families
    like Stag Slab/Sans, Neutraface and Meta Sans/Serif, some of these other cheaper

    get more udaptes. When I update Larabie Fonts fonts they go to MyFonts and 1001freefonts.com.
    Other sites might pick them up eventually but I doubt it. I've been hammering
    away at the entire collection for the last few weeks. I've been updating about
    5 families per year but 2009 will see a lot more updates, plus some commercial
    additions to the free families. When I add new styles I'll have a chance to rebuild/repair
    some of the older fonts so even if people stick to the free versions, they'll
    still see some improvement.\r\n\r\nOctin lowercase: Oh, probably, someday but
    more likely a new, similar type of family. I experimented with Octin lowercase
    but it just seemed to take something away from the caps . . . by their very presence.
    Adding new characters to textured fonts can be tough. I screwed around in Photoshop
    for about an hour to get that vintage t-shirt texture right, so I don't think
    I'd be able to match a lowercase set. I'll definitely think about it though."

    \ I've contacted Jason and he referred me to numerous free font makers who I contacted
    and all responded positively to the download as being with their permission.\r\n\r\nYeah
    10,000 fonts for $20, isn't really a bad deal in my opinion, even they aren't
    all complete, etc.  For $20 if you get even 10 quality fonts that are licensed
    for commercial use, it's a pretty good deal.  I wasn't looking for entire libraries
    to print tomes, but rather something to add flavor to various pieces of artwork.
    \ I think the download was worth it.\r\n\r\nAgain, so long as they're all legit,
    which seems to be the case.  As someone suggested, the website would look a little
    more legit if there was a bit more info on it.  I would also recommend that the
    license that comes with the download explicitly state permissions that were given
    by each font maker by name.  If it's possible, perhaps each font by name as well."

    I think many would agree that in terms of power-house, versatile typefaces that
    can be a solid tool in your toolbox, in the realm of the free, there aren't a
    whole lot. Sure, there's plenty of one-off useful display faces. I won't argue
    any of the subjective points of those. \r\n\r\nThat was merely my opinion. You
    may disagree.\r\n\r\n\"check the EULA on those fonts you spent a few minutes collecting.
    How many allow commercial use or even contain a EULA that makes any sense?\"\r\n\r\nThat's
    what I was getting at...there are only a few dozen that really offer true open
    source and/or freeware and/or public domain licenses that give you free reign.\r\n\r\nI
    won't get into 'making sense' as I'm not so sure a lot of commercial font EULAs
    make a whole lot of sense either ;o)\r\n\r\nFor the record, I really have nothing
    against this download thing. I just find having 10000 fonts somewhat pointless,
    regardless of the quality/cost. \r\n\r\n\"For $20 if you get even 10 quality fonts
    that are licensed for commercial use, it\u2019s a pretty good deal.\"\r\n\r\nExactly.
    It'd almost be a better deal if the collection WERE divided into smaller $20 downloads.
    Part of what you pay for is convenience, and I'm not sure slogging through 10,000
    fonts is a convenient thing to do:\r\n\r\n - Download all 10,000 faces for $20\r\n\r\nor\r\n
    \r\n - download these select 10 text faces for $30\r\n - download these select
    10 display faces for $30\r\n - etc.\r\n\r\nIt sounds silly, perhaps, but I'd probably
    opt for the latter. Yea, I'm paying more for less, but I'm gaining a lot of time."
