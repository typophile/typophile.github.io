body: "I've just been looking at some old London Transport Underground posters for
  the Zoo (around the 1920's) and I noticed an overlapping double \"O\" ligature and
  a W with the middle strokes overlapping, like in Scala. It looks a lot like Johnston,
  but none of the versions I've looked at seem to have these variations. Does anyone
  know what it is I've seen?\r\n\r\nI can't find any images of this and I'm away from
  the scanner - I'll post some as soon as I can find something relevant.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nEdit
  - On second look it's blatantly not Johnston at all, but it would be good to know
  what it is (assuming it's not just hand-lettering). Can't direct link the images,
  but here's an example url - http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/poster/poster.html?_IXSR_=jJnJkp7ZCjW&_IXMAXHITS_=1&IXinv=1983/4/1096&IXsummary=dates/decade&IXfromdate=1920&IXtodate=1929&IXfilter=poster&_IXFIRST_=163"

    thing. Thanks for the help.
