  body: Still too many other differences ('C', 'A') to make me believe it's a customized
    Alt Gothic. I believe this is a font used straight from the box. I've seen that
    'R' before.

  body: "I really, really doubt that its custom. \r\nI love the depth (length?) of
    the bowl in the R, it make the face seem warmer than your usual gothic, more personality.
    \ I think thats why I like Vertag or Neutraface, but they seems a bit too deco
    for what I need right now. \r\noh, help."

  body: If you're making something small, It's actually not too difficult to stretch
    the 'R' bowl of any straight-sided sans in Illustrator. Just make sure you lengthening
    only the straight lines.

    body: I suppose the time doing that would probably equal the time I've spent looking
      for it. Its becoming a bit of an obsession. I just can't shake this feeling
      that I've seen it. And, if someone has designed a font like this, I would feel
      like I was plagiarizing. Is that silly?

  body: You might be if you generate a new font. But if you're not planning to set
    too much text, there's nothing wrong with creating something similar in Illie.
