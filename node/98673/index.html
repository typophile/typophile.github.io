<p>In the ﬁrst place, not just paper, but ink and metal were improved considerably in the 18th century.</p>
<p>Secondly, technological determinism won’t wash, when there were other cultural factors at play. As John Hudson has noted, the role of the writing masters (and perhaps pen technology?) was important.</p>
<p>The idea that Baskerville’s type was the game-changer in enabling the neoclassical Didone style is a myth. The Foulis publishers in Scotland were producing neo-classical types and typography, in the context of printing classical literature (from ancient Greece and Rome), prior to Baskerville’s work.</p>
<p>I am sure there were other dynamics in France and Germany which contributed to the emergence of the didone style. Certainly, one man can make a huge difference, but design happens when there is a convergence of possibilities in the broad ecology of culture.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is true that a type like Baskerville would not have worked without high quality printing. And Baskerville played an important role in making printing of this higher quality available.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the improvement in the basic capability of printing things with finer detail on paper would have taken place without Baskerville as technology progressed; that&rsquo;s true too.</p>
<p>But without Baskerville pointing the way, perhaps the revolution in printing would have taken place too late for Didot and Bodoni.</p>
<p>Still, wouldn&rsquo;t Didones - like slab-serifs, Clarendons, and Latins (wedge-serifs) - have been almost &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo;, rather than being easily subject to butterfly-effect erasure? I&rsquo;m not sure psychohistory has progressed to the level which would allow us to answer such questions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Changes in printing and prepress technology often spawn changes in the design aesthetic.</em></p>
<p>In this case, I think the clear evidence is that it was the other way round: the aesthetic development drove changes in papermaking and printing technology. The neoclassical aesthetic that Baskerville applied to typography with such great success by way of his fine presswork and, yes, ideal paper, had been the dominant aesthetic in scribal text production for several decades before Baskerville had his types cut, and as Nick notes there were other printer publishers seeking ways to apply this aesthetic to typography.</p>
<p>One of the stranger things I have found examples of in my research on the English writing masters of the early 18th Century is occasional examples of engraved copy books with typeset prefatory matter, usually in Caslon&rsquo;s types. The disconnect between the aesthetic of the type and that of the engraved handwritten designs that follow is jarring to me, and I believe it was to the makers of these books too, especially the scribes whose work was displayed. My thesis is that during the first half of the 18th Century writing masters were devising a new page aesthetic in keeping with the emerging neoclassicism in architecture and the other arts, and that this aesthetic then drove improvements in printing and papermaking that would enable it to be applied to typography.</p>

<p>One finds formal roman capitals engraved in a neoclassical style very early: even in the latter 17th Century. These, from an engraved a portrait of John Seddon published in 1695, are practically Didone in their modulation and rationality:</p>

They were regarded as innovative immediately, with both negative and positive connotations. John (Quadibloc) has referred to the claims of some &ndash; famously related by Ben Franklin &ndash; that Baskerville&rsquo;s types dazzled readers and would make them go blind. But by 1803 positive commentary celebrated Baskerville&rsquo;s achievement:</p>
<blockquote>The extraordinary efforts which have of late years been made to produce the finest models of Printing Types, must be highly gratifying to those who have in any measure interested themselves in raising the credit of the BRITISH PRESS. The spirit for this species of beauty has long been gaining ascendancy, having received a strong impulse from the talents of Baskerville, who endeavoured to combine sharpness and perfection of impression, with graceful types, giving to his works a finish which was before unknown in this kingdom.</blockquote>

<p>Of course they don&rsquo;t have names. Historically, types were most commonly identified by style, size and foundry. So these are Baskerville&rsquo;s roman and italic types of various sizes.</p>

<hr>
<p>As I suspect, at least some of the early Foulis editions, while exhibiting neoclassical layout, are using baroque types:

<p>Later, post-Baskerville, there is a switch to neoclassical types:

		<div class="commentbody">I see this as being a case of “follow the money”. Scotland became Europe’s most literate country in the 18th century. One reason often cited is the role of the Presbyterian church school in promoting widespread literacy. Another is the removal of copyright restrictions that would remain in England until the 19th century, which caused a publishing boom. (Documented in William St Clair’s <em>The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</em>.) It follows that the progressive qualities of the Scottish Enlightenment would be reﬂected in the design and typography of books published there. This was the cultural environment that produced the Adam brothers and James Watt, and the typefounder Alexander Wilson.</div>
