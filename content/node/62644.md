  body: "The more I look at this the more I am convinced it is a custom font, unless
    it is a more involved customization than just using negative stroke. Nick Shinn's
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/|Scotch Modern]] has at least
    got similar letterforms, if you look at its 'skeleton', but it would take more
    than negative stroking to get to this.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
