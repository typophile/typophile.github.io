body: "About Concord\r\nYet another typeface with simplicity as it's core element.
  Concord is derived from a successful type family 'Accord Alternate' by giving geometric
  touch to it. Hence Concord is a geometric sans serif. It has large counters which
  enhance readability. It is available in seven different weights for emphasis.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_5491.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/03_4727.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/04_4536.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/05_4961.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/06_3590.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/11_4453.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/09_4360.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/12_6413.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Uppercase_5142.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lowercase_6172.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Other_3673.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/02_5226.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailable
