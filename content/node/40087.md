body: I'm going to be upgrading from TypeTool to a better program, pretty soon here.
  I had planned on upgrading to FontLab, but I just disovered that I could instead
  upgrade to Fontographer for $300 less. So, my question is, what would I be missing
  if I didn't spend those $300? The big limitations on me from TypeTool are that it
  won't let me put more than one character set in a font, it takes lots of effort
  to make all the accented characters, and it's a bit unstable. Would Fontographer
  solve these problems? If I wanted to export in .otf format, would I have to buy
  FogLamp, or is there another utility that I could use? And what does FontLab have
  that Fontographer doesn't?

    guys in Texas were great - too bad they sold out.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I had a demo
    of FontLab -- and for the Mac I was too impressed. It was good for opening OT
    fonts and for saving them. The Fontographer I have doesn't even recognize an OT
    font -- but it is great for making Mac Type 1 fonts. \r\n\r\nDon't know if that
    helps you - but I think you can still try a 30 day demonstration from each and
    decide for yourself. Then you can report back here an let us know."

  body: "I would strongly recommend FontLab. I was using Fontographer at first (for
    about two-three months while learning how to make fonts...) but very soon I felt
    it was very limited. You cant make an OpenType font in Fontographer, and you cant
    use any OpenType features at all. OpenType is the new standard, and that makes
    Fontographer outdated.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of old, the whole application has an old,
    almost retro-touch over it. It feels like using an application in MacOS 7.5 or
    something with anti-aliasing always OFF, which makes the bezier curves look not
    so smooth. FontLab is smooth and you see the letters as you see them in apps like
    InDesign etc. Fontographer is looking more like some old CAD-vector-drawing tool.
    Think of the difference between game consoles. Fontographer is like a Commodore
    64 or Atari 128 while FontLab is more like Xbox 360 ;-)\r\n\r\nOther than that,
    I would also like to add that FontLab has a whole bunch of helping tools that
    really helps you when making fonts, and you can also add all the great python
    scripts available.\r\n\r\nGo FontLab, you wont regret it!"

  body: While you're at it, don't forget to give [[http://fontforge.sf.net/|FontForge]]
    a try. It's come a long way in the last few months even, now that it has a Spiro
    drawing mode that no other font editor has (if you install libspiro first, among
    some other dependencies you may need to install too). It will generate OpenType
    fonts and a bunch of other formats both common and obscure. It's a little weird
    and initially uncomfortable working in an X11 window when you're used to Mac software,
    but you'll get over it, and if you find you don't like it at least you aren't
    out any cash for trying.

  body: I looked at FontForge (the website - I haven't run it yet), and it seems to
    have the same problem as Fontographer in that it has anti-aliasing perpetually
    off. Is that true?

  body: "Just out of curiosity, I've been playing around with FontForge. I've read
    a bit about it in <em>Fonts & Encodings</em> and learned that it has some features
    that don't (yet) exist in FontLab, which could make it useful as a supplementary
    tool to FontLab, such as support for Raph's spiro curve drawing system, creating
    AAT fonts, and the ability to add OT features not yet supported by the [[AFDKO]]
    (and therefore not yet supported by FontLab). Also, it has .ufo support, which
    makes it compatible with tools like Superpolator and MetricsMachine. \r\n\r\nI
    can't seem to get the spiro tool to work though. The button on the tool bar to
    activate it is greyed out and disabled."

  body: "I used Fontographer from the early nineties for over 10 years. Once you got
    use to working around its many bugs, it was OK for making Type 1 fonts. It was
    fairly intuitive, unlike (in my opinion) FontLab. I imagine I whined & complained
    when I had to learn FontLab after using Fontographer for 10+ years.\r\n\r\nNow
    I wouldn't go back. Part of that was due to some of the nice points of Fontographer
    being phased out (the behavior of the kerning window) with Macromedia's release
    4.X. A lot of it has to do with not having to work around all the bugs. FontLab
    has a few, but nowhere near what you had to put up with using Fontographer.\r\n\r\nAs
    to OpenType features -- if you will be making fonts you would like InDesign users
    to buy, you need to be making OpenType fonts, which means including OpenType features.
    Adobe and Microsoft are big players these days. They seem to committed to OT technology,
    and that is probably more important than whether or not OT is, in some abstract
    sense, the best format.  \r\n"

    possible to get anti-aliasing in the glyph drawing window of FontForge, but it
    requires a custom build and, I think, an extra library or something. The current
    default builds do not include the feature. I'll relay the details if anyone is
    interested."
