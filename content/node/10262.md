  1800s and encountered a strange trend in the text: Every word hyphen &#40;everything
  not acting as a line-break, that is&#41; is unusually long. <BR> <BR>About twice
  as long as normal, in fact, so it may actually be an en-dash. Whatever the case,
  she&#39;s curious whether there&#39;s a reason for this. I told her that whatever
  the original cause, it&#39;s probably a stylistic one -- an odd face, an odd author,
  an odd editor -- and doesn&#39;t need to be retained, but now I&#39;m just curious.
  Was this sort of thing a common phenomenon in 19th-century book publishing, for
  whatever reason? <BR> <BR>Thanks much, <BR> <BR>- Brandon'

  body: Sorry, correction -- this isn&#39;t a book from the 1800s, it&#39;s a book
    from now, but it&#39;s made up of text compiled from 1871. It&#39;s a historian&#39;s
    recreation of the Hansard &#40;Canadian Parliamentary  <BR>debates&#41; for a
    period of several months. Recreation because the actual Hansard records from then
    don&#39;t actually exist, so he had to compile them based on other material. Anyway,
    the point stands, because even though it&#39;s a current work, it&#39;s built
    from 1870s material, and &#40;meant to be&#41; in that style.
