body: "So I'm having this issue, where I just installed a typeface, but instead of
  every weight being nested within one typeface family, every weight has it's own
  name within the character menu of both indesign, and illustrator. The result is
  I end up having a long list of fonts from the same typeface instead of just the
  family name, so it gets all mucked up, and I want it to be organized correctly.
  I took a screenshot of what I'm talking about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo does anyone have
  a solution to this problem, or is there any software out there that can fix it?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/myproblem_6641.jpg]"

    of\_Type1 families, in\_which experts sets were often named incorrectly for technical
    limitations and basic styles/weights were also named that way for consistency
    in\_font list. Try to look at those fonts in\_Font Book or\_other font manager
    which will give you extended info about names etc."

    issues. It's a font's [name] table which is making trouble. You'll need software,
    which will dig into this table (e.g., a\_font editor) and then you'll have to
    change it's entries manually. I doubt there would be an automatic solution. There
    are some free font editors out there, like [[http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/|FontForge]],

    you were right, kontrapunkt. fortunately a machine a skool has fontlab, and I

  body: I don't know why your font menu is doing that, but you can't run any Adobe
    product without the AdobeFnt.lst files getting generated. (They're used to cache
    information so that the product doesn't have to open up every font during startup.
    They're also just text files and you can read them with any text editor.)  So,
    to be clear, the file name is AdobeFntxx.lst where xx is a 2 digit number. On
    Windows you would search for AdobeFnt*.lst.  The number is incremented when the
    format of the file changes.  For InDesign 2.0 the number was 06, CS was 07, CS2
    was 10, CS3 was 11.

  body: well i tried to search for the adobefnt.list things again, and i guess the
    first time i must have spelled them wrong, or something, because they did come
    up, i did find them, but getting rid of them didn't solve the problem. I guess
    i can try to call PSY/OPS, but at least i have a backup with fontlab, and with
    taht program I don't have to save overtop of the original files so i'm not in
    danger of losing any info, especially since they're all backed up.

  body: Do you use font management software? If you have any type library at all,
    you should be using FontAgentPro, which will nest the families as you wish, once
    your fonts are installed in its program. That's how my font families usually display
    in my Quark and Photoshop CS1. Only some of the small boutique foundry families
    remain stubbornly perverse--on this and other tech issues!
