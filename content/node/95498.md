  body: "That link is a PITA. The font is widely available at simpler sites, too.
    \ Justin Callaghan is a Disneyworld/Disneyland typography fan; He designed Space
    Age as an original font, based on the logotype for Epcot's \"Mission: Space\"
    attraction. \r\n\r\nI don't know if that particular download link included his
    original text file, which has instructions regarding the use of the tilde and
    underscore to create 'ligatures' (he really meant bottom or top-linked letters)\r\n\r\n
