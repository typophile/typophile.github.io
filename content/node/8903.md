body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for a program that allows me to create or
  modify fonts. The problem is that one of the fonts I want to modify is a Japanese
  font and has nearly 16000 glyphs in it. <BR> <BR>First I tried the shareware version
  of Font Creator, but it seemed real slow, I tried moving the japanese characters
  to another font, and 10 minutes later, it was still frozen and windows would say
  the program was not responding anymore, so I just gave up. <BR> <BR>Fontographer
  wouldn&#39;t even open the file, saying there was not enough memory to perform the
  operation. <BR> <BR>I also heard of another program called FontLab, it looks really
  nice &#40;and really expensive too&#41;, but I read that you cannot save fonts with
  more than 6400 glyphs in them.  <BR> <BR>Does anyone know of a good program that
  can handle big fonts like that?  <BR> <BR>Renn.

    a time. Divide your glyphs file into smaller chunks process them then combine
    it into the mega file. I get dizzy just thinking about 16000 glyphs

  body: FontLab has a companion program, <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/Font-tools/AsiaFont-Studio/">AsiaFont
    Studio</a>, that can do exactly what you want. There&#39;s even a demo version
    for you to try out.

  body: What&#39;s the font format? Truetype, I suppose? <BR>I think you may be able
    to do your job with Fontlab too. Download the demo and contact FL for more information.
    <BR>Dan, it&#39;s usual for CJK fonts &#40;Chinese, Korean, Japanese&#41; to have
    thousands of glyphs.

  body: As FontLab is limited to 6400 glyphs specifically so it won&#39;t complete
    with AsiaFont Studio, I am pretty sure it won&#39;t work for this purpose. <BR>
    <BR>AsiaFont Studio is the only application I know that I know will work for this.
    It&#39;s possible that DTL FontMaster can do it as well, though I don&#39;t know.
