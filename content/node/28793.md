  body: "I only do occassional graphic design work at the moment, but I have worked
    for a few bigger firms, who each had purchasing and IT departments, who all had
    their say in fonts. Anyway, here are my answers.\r\n\r\n<em>1) Do you ever purchase
    fonts before you know what (paying) project they will be applied to?</em>\r\n\r\nYes.
    I have almost only bought licenses for specific projects. It is a nice bonus that
    I get to use the fonts later on in the future. But when I think font licensing,
    I think short term use, i.e., the next project.\r\n\r\n<em>2a) Are you more inclined
    to purchase where you see a large family of weights, styles and cuts available?</em>\r\n\r\nSort
    of. That depends what you mean by large! A family needs to have a few weights
    and variants for me. But 20? or 200? Not really, especially since I get fonts
    for specific projects, so I tend to know which weights I'll probably need.\r\n\r\n<em>2b)
    If so, do you prefer to purchase them all in one?</em>\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n<em>Are
    the following important when deciding between fonts:\r\n\r\n3) International accents
    & alphabets (European, Greek, etc.)</em>\r\n\r\nA few years a go, no. But now,
    it is paramont. Since I'm working in Central Europe, Eastern European accents
    are a requirement. Plus, staring Jan. 1, 2007, the EU will have three official
    writing systems in it (Latin, Greek, and Bulgarian Cyrillic).\r\n\r\n<em>4) Alternate
    characters (swash \u2018&\u2019, ornamented letters)\r\n5) Additional glyphs (archaic
    letters, dash suites)\r\n6) OpenType \u201Ctypographics\u201D (alt. punctuation
    for caps, smart fractions)\r\n7) OpenType \u201Cneatos\u201D (random alternates,
    automated ligatures)</em>\r\n\r\nI love these, but they are never the deal maker
    or breaker for me."

    where you see a large family of weights, styles and cuts available?</ul>\r\n\r\nVariety
    is always a good thing. But depending upon the family and use it is sometimes
    unnecessary.\r\n\r\n<ul>2b) If so, do you prefer to purchase them all in one?</ul>\r\n\r\nIf
    I can afford it at the time I will license the entire family as in the long run
    it would be more expensive to license them bits at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre the
    following important when deciding between fonts:\r\n\r\n<ul>3) International accents
    & alphabets (European, Greek, etc.)</ul>\r\n\r\nGreek and Cyrillic are a different
    issue, but I think the type designer is being lazy if they can't at least include
    all/most diacritical marks. (Is that mean?)\r\n\r\n<ul>4) Alternate characters
    (swash \u2018&\u2019, ornamented letters)</ul>\r\n\r\nDepends upon the typeface.
    Sometimes the design is screaming for more, but I think this is a very subjective
    thing.\r\n\r\n<ul>5) Additional glyphs (archaic letters, dash suites)</ul>\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you mean by dash suites? Em and En dash? This again is a subjective thing and
    more of a specific need for a specific project. No?\r\n\r\n6) OpenType \u201Ctypographics\u201D
    (alt. punctuation for caps, smart fractions)\r\n\r\nMore and more I want OpenType.
    Especially if the family has small caps and extended ligature features. \r\n\r\n<ul>7)
    OpenType \u201Cneatos\u201D (random alternates, automated ligatures)</ul>\r\n\r\nThis
    seems backwards somehow. \r\n\r\n<ul>8) What other features strongly affect the
    decision? Price? Support? License choices? Anything else?</ul>\r\n\r\nThe license
    of course. But again, if I license from a foundry with a very restrictive EULA
    I can only use the font in certain instances."

  body: "<em>1) Do you ever purchase fonts before you know what (paying) project they
    will be applied to?</em>\r\n\r\nYes. I pay for quality type for personal projects
    as well.\r\n\r\n<em>2a) Are you more inclined to purchase where you see a large
    family of weights, styles and cuts available?</em>\r\n\r\nNot directly; most of
    my projects only need a couple of styles.  I suppose having a larger family makes
    it more likely that the styles I need will be there, so it helps indirectly.\r\n\r\n<em>2b)
    If so, do you prefer to purchase them all in one?</em>\r\n\r\nI'll buy a full
    family if it's one I expect to use a lot, or if I need enough that the full family
    is not significantly more expensive.  Otherwise, no.\r\n\r\n<em>3) International
    accents & alphabets (European, Greek, etc.)</em>\r\n\r\nAccents are important,
    but the only non-Latin writing system I use much is Japanese, and I certainly
    don't expect Western type designers to support <em>that</em>.  :)\r\n\r\n<em>4)
    Alternate characters (swash \u2018&\u2019, ornamented letters)\r\n5) Additional
    glyphs (archaic letters, dash suites)</em>\r\n\r\nUsually unimportant.\r\n\r\n<em>6)
    OpenType \u201Ctypographics\u201D (alt. punctuation for caps, smart fractions)</em>\r\n\r\nConvenient,
    but not essential. With the lengths of text I work with, it's just as easy to
    tweak things by hand.\r\n\r\n<em>7) OpenType \u201Cneatos\u201D (random alternates,
    automated ligatures)</em>\r\n\r\nLargely irrelevant to me.  (I'd include standard
    ligatures in \"typographics\" myself, so I assume you mean fancy ligatures here.)\r\n\r\n<em>8)
    What other features strongly affect the decision? Price? Support? License choices?
    Anything else?</em>\r\n\r\nThe EULA.  Restricting embedding is a big minus, permitting
    modification is a big plus."

  body: "I buy fonts without knowing what I'm going to do with them all too frequently.
    I seldom buy large families since I find I don't use the full range.\r\n\r\nEuropean,
    including Eastern Europe, support is important to me, and I have set a few phrases
    in Greek, so that's nice, but not really too important to me.\r\n\r\nI'm a sucker
    for Opentype features, and wouldn't buy a text face that didn't have smallcaps
    and osfs available.\r\n\r\nThe EULA is <em>very</em> important to me. If embedding
    isn't allowed, I <em>won't</em> buy. I really want the right to make modifications
    for my own use.\r\n\r\nI'm not in the least interested in faces that have smallcaps
    and ligatures in separate fonts unless the EULA permits modifications, in which
    case I'll gladly make an OT version for myself.\r\n\r\nIf there is an OT version,
    I <em>might</em> consider a face with a EULA that restricts modifications, but
    even then I'm leery."

  body: "These are interesting responses. I predicted a few quite wrongly. It sounds
    like internationalization is as important to  others as it to me, for a variety
    of reasons. A lot of the other features I asked about sound more important to
    someone formatting an entire book, than to a designer laying short work ion display
    text?\r\n\r\nI don't see the harm modifications could do in a purchased font.
    Presumably, releasing any modifications as a packaged font file is usually condemned
    by earlier terms of a license. Is this really a common problem? It seems like
    a worthless clause, since one could simply modify graphics in  front or behind
    the font output, anyhow, to achieve the same effect. Are small foundries commonly
    overly-restrictive?\r\n\r\nWould purchasers be interested in the same font (or
    family) with different licenses for different prices? Or is that confusing?\r\n\r\nChoz
