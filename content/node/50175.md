  is a font I've come across several times recently that was used in the 1980's and
  I need to replicate it.  Can anyone lead me to a similar font?\r\n\r\nI'm attaching
  a picture from the cover of the movie \"Exposed\"....  it's the pink lettering.\r\n\r\nThanks
  VERY much in advance for any leads.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nRyan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo_4476.jpg]"

    substance called \"ink\" or \"paint\" one could make lettering like this. I've
    never used one myself, and I still don't understand how these \"brushes\" even
    interfaced with a computer, since they don't seem to have any wires, and wireless
    technology wasn't really that big back then.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Just to give props to the original poster but they do note that it's handwritten
    - I think they could have been clearer in what they want though- which is, I assume,
    a font with a similar look and feel.

  body: "I can't think of any script fonts with such long connectors between the letters.
    You might be able to adapt Letraset's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/rapier/|Rapier]]
    which is a late '80s design.\r\n\r\nAlso look through all these scripts by:\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/person/leuschke/rob/|Rob
    Leuschke]],\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/person/borges-de-oliveira/charles/|Charles
    Borges de Oliveira]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/sudtipos/|Sudtipos]]\r\n\r\nYour
    example looks as if it was done in some kind of crayon or pastel. If you want
    this exact look it will be even harder to match with a digital font. You might
    be better off getting a few different script fonts and use them as a starting
    point to draw your own lettering."

    which shouldn't be too difficult with a little digital manipulation afterwards.\r\n\r\nThanks
