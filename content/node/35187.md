body: "I was wondering whether the 65k glyphs per font limit was carried over from
  the truetype format. Does anyone know if that is the case? \r\n\r\nGranted, it isn't
  a limitation that is encountered very often, but in cases such as the free Han Nom
  A/B fonts, it was necessary to split the font into two separate files to deal with
  the full set of CJK(v) Unicode code points. I was hoping this rather artificial
  split could be avoided by migrating to OTF.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDaniel Peebles"

  body: Last time I looked, 16-bit (2^16) fonts would give somewhere around 65,536
    characters. What you want is 32-bit fonts.
