body: Ok, here&#39;s the deal.  I&#39;m trying to figure out how typographers determine
  the weight of a font.  For example, Helvetica comes in several weights with different
  names, Ie Helvetica Neue 75 Bold.  What does the 75 mean?  Obviously the weight
  or stroke of Helvetica 25 is lighter than 45 or 75, but how do they come up with
  that number??  What measurement is that, and what point size are they basing that
  off of?  For example, Helvetica 25 and 75 at 12 points doesn&#39;t appear to have
  any correlation.  The weight of Helvetica 75 doesn&#39;t appear to be 3 times the
  weight of Helvetica 25, infact is seems to be more like 6 times the weight.  Please
  any help is appreciated. I&#39;ve looked all over and asked everyone I know.  Thanks

    principle. This principle was first used by Adrian Frutiger for his Univers family.
    Here is an image which might help you understand his matrix: <BR><a href="http://www.typotheque.com/articles/images_articles/majoor/07-Univers-21-versions.gif"

    <BR> <BR>The main, central weight of Univers is the Regular weight, Univers 55.
    55 doesn&#39;t mean anything geometric; it is a combination of 5 and 5 &#40;5
    being the middle digit between 1 and 9&#41;. <BR> <BR>The lighter you go, the
    lower the first number in the two digit combination drops &#40;55 to 45 to 35
    to 25 to 15&#41;. Higher is also bolder &#40;so 65 is bold, 75 is bolder, 95 is
    totally fat...&#41; <BR> <BR>65 is Bold Regular, 35 is Thin Regular. The second
    number in the combination determines what happens to the basic weight other than
    heaviness/lightness. 56 is Regular Oblique, 57 is condensed. 46 is light italic,
    67 is bold condensed. <BR> <BR>The numbers are just an organizing principle! <BR>Frutiger
    has used these numbers of his for almost all of his typefaces, but they never
    really caught on outside of his circle. Linotype tried them for a few non-Frutiger
    fonts, such as Helvetica Neue. <BR> <BR>Does that explanation make sense? <BR>
    <BR>Here is a link to Linotype&#39;s revised, expanded Univers family, which uses
    a three digit numbering system now instead of two. &#40;Both because this version
    has a lot more weights, and so that its weights won&#39;t be confused with previous
    Univers releases&#41; <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-1805-6-15548/numeration.html"

    <BR>John Hudson worked on Helvetica Neue back in the 80s; maybe he&#39;ll stop
    by this thread and add some insight!'
