  was designed back in 1978, I'm assuming it was hand crafted, but based on an existing
  physical typesetting face. Would love to id what it was and if it ever was digitized
  into TTF, OTF, etc.\r\n\r\nNote: The original wordmark was surrounded by an contour
  outline that I removed to make id easier.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WeedhopperLogo_noOutline_4447.jpg]"
