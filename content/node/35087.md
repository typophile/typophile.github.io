body: I'm sketching up logotypes for an art show and am interested in modern reinterpretations
  of blackletter, along the lines of HTF Fetish. Not looking for historically accurate
  versions, and in some sense, the more twisted the better. I know I've seen others
  besides Fetish but can't remember them just now. Any suggestions in this category?
  Thanks.

  body: Saber was the one I'd mentally filed with Fetish. But that B*stard is lovely
    stuff too.

  body: FF Karo would be an interesting choice, as it's by a Montreal designer and
    that's where this work's being done.
