<div class=commentbody>Jason -- Glad to hear that you're planning to come this year. That's great. I'll be there, of course.
We're a little bit behind schedule getting the full TypeCon website up and running (www.typecon.com). There have been some structural overhauls behind the scenes and the web wonks (all generous volunteers!) are working hard to get everything buttoned down. Hopefully soon.
Naturally, the early registration cut-off has been adjusted accordingly.
Also, Tamye is still fielding those last-minute proposals and juggling everything to put together another dynamite program.
But the hotel is already taking reservations and Tamye negotiated the room rate down even further than first announced -- another $15/night slashed. So, if you know you're coming, you might go ahead and reserve the room even before we get the registration up and live.

<div class=commentbody>Ah, Tiff, finally I'll have a chance to say hello in person. Looking forward to seeing who else is planning on attending so that I might connect face to face with some of the gang I've interacted with around here over the past few years.
I'm going to spend the entire week in Buffalo (15-21), then head off for a week in NY, with a day at the NY Center for Book Arts, an afternoon each at the Grolier Club and the NYPL Rare Books Division, an afternoon at Poets House (browsing their over 8,000 poetry chapbooks), and then a couple of days visiting galleries & book stores. 

As a tangent to this thread, anyone know of any book shops in NY similar to <a href=http://www.wlbooks.com/cgi-bin/wlb455.cgi/index.html target=_blank>Wessel & Lieberman</a> in Seattle (with dedicated sections of typography & fine-press books)? I'll spend some time at Strand, of course, but I'm looking for small-/fine-press stuff that might be done letterpress.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yay, TypeCon! I can't wait. The program is coming together, and it's going to be an amazing lineup. The website is so close - our wonderful volunteers are building a better one, and it always takes more time than we think. We changed the early bird registration deadline so you'll all have plenty of time to register at the lowest rate once the website goes live.
Do book hotel fast, no matter what. We contracted for a very large block of rooms at the Hyatt for our group, but the super low rate of $109 per night means more of our attendees than ever will stay at the conference hotel. We have always sold out our room block in the past, and it looks like we will sell out a lot quicker this year.
I'm headed back to Buffalo for more planning meetings and to finalize special events and such, just in time for Cinco de Mayo. The weather is wonderful, and everyone in Buff is so excited that we're coming!</div>

Working hypothesis is that if you book for two you can only choose a double bed because it is a conference rate?
<cite>Hey, Jupiterboy (a.k.a. James), me too! I was only able to choose a room with two double beds — so if you want to be my roommate, just say the word! The only caveat is that I asked for a Non-Smoking room.</cite>
(a.k.a. Mark BTW) That's a great idea and a smart offer however Pam will be with me (hooray!) so I was more interested in avoiding the Dick Van Dyke arrangements. After calling the hotel I believe it will be a matter of availability on arrival.
<cite>While we’re at it, anyone from Buffalo have suggestions for good book stores? Is anyone from Buffalo?</cite> Paul Hunt and Richard Kegler are the go to guys on this. I suspect some of the Toronto peeps know their way around too.

There are a few "antiquarian" bookshops. One of the largest is conveniently located a very short walk from the conference hotel.

A google earth map is being prepared that has local points of interest related to the conference including bookshops. I believe this should be made available when the website goes live.</div>

<div class=commentbody>There may be an obvious answer to this question...
Typecon has always interested me, but lack of funds has kept me away in the past. But providing that I can afford it this year, would this be beneficial to someone who isn't a type designer? Granted I am a graphic designer with an interest in type.
I just didn't know if I should continue on going to HOW like I have in the past or make a change.
Would be nice if I could get my company would pay, but I know that won't happen. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Katherine --
I don't know what would qualify as beneficial for you. But the truth of the matter is that TypeCon is expressly for people who have an interest in type. It's only incidentally useful for type designers per se.
TypeCon got its start as a get-together of typophiles (lowercase 't') who just wanted to hang out and indulge/share their love of all things typographic. It just so happens that Bob Colby (the guy who started it, who isn't even a designer at all) convinced Matthew Carter to come and talk. Chank was at the first couple too. And so was David Berlow.
So, before you know it typophiles of all stripes -- graphic designers, type designers, letterpress printers, non-design-related aficionados: users <em>and</em> makers -- were all congregating together and having a good ol' time.
The presentations range from historical to technical, from fanciful to practical, from making to using, and everything in between. There's a lot of overlap with design issues and interests -- like past presentations by Kit Hinrichs (SF) or Paula Scher (NY). (And have you heard: Stefan Sagmeister is speaking this year at the Wednesday pre-conference talk.)
One of the great benefits of TypeCon (compared to conferences like AIGA or HOW or even ATypI) is that it is pretty small and informal, so there is a lot of mixing and mingling -- very little (if any) of that cliquishness that you can find at larger gatherings.
It really isn't out of the question, for instance, to end up at a coffee break sitting on a bench next to Matthew Carter, James Montalbano, John Downer, or Akira Kobayashi (or even all four!). Plus, type designers get to interact directly with users and hear what they're liking and not liking, etc.
It's really beneficial for anyone who is interested in type.
Now, whether or not you can make that case to your boss . . . that's another matter. I suppose it just depends.

It’s really not that bad—type geeks are a very mellow/egalitarian crowd. Although the thought of thinking up something worthwhile to say scared the crap out of me every time I got on an elevator with Matthew Carter or Akira Kobayashi at Typecon 2007.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Katherine,
Have you compared the cost of attending TypeCon with the same costs for HOW? Seems to me HOW is an order of magnitude more pricey. TypeCon is remarkably affordable. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Very much looking forward to seeing the full schedule, and also to the Education forum. The college I teach at is launching a new Writing & Publishing diploma this fall, with 6 typography & publication design courses that I've developed, so I'm eager to hear what others have worked up during curriculum development at various institutions.
Also just looking forward to workshops and meeting like-minded type people. I moved to a rather small town last April. 'Nuff said.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was in an elevator with Matthew Carter at one of the TypeCons and found him to be quite easy to talk to. He is not the least bit pretentious nor is Akira. Type people don't tend to be so stuck with there own egos that they can't be human and cordial. Fear not, we don't bite but we may obsess over a well fitted typeface. :-)

<div class=commentbody>As far as newbies going to TypeCon - I knew nothing about type (other than liking it a lot) when I went to TypeCon in 2006. I still know little about it compared to the typ-0-graphers who hang out here, but my eye for design has benefited greatly. And it's fun! I've now read all the books about typography at my city library, and I've yet to be bored.
I'm on a tight budget this year (last time, my company payed - and I'm freelance now), so if any other women are interested in sharing a hotel room, let me know. I haven't yet decided if I can go... I hope so!

<div class=commentbody>OK, friends, the hotel situation is sorted out. I called our contact at the Hyatt, and we have indeed been filling our room block so availability was tight on some days. The Hyatt was gracious enough to give us a few more rooms at the cheap TypeCon rate, and fixed a glitch in the system that didn't allow singles or kings to be specified on some dates. So if you booked a double and want a king, if you go back now and amend your reservation, you'll be able to fix it. We are going to be short on doubles this year, so please do give up your double if you have one and won't need the extra bed.
That said, book your rooms fast. They are going quicker than in past years, and more people are coming in early and staying late. We will sell out well in advance of our cut-off, and you don't want to miss being in the conference hotel (especially at such a bargain price).
I can wholeheartedly echo the sentiments about the lack of pretension and ego in the type community. After admiring the work of people like Matthew Carter and Erik Spiekermann from afar for years, I was so pleasantly surprised to find out what lovely people they are. We are very lucky to have such a welcoming community, and newcomers should never fear - it's easy to make friends at TypeCon.</div>
