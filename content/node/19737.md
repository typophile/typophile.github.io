  one of those 1970's-era Letraset faces, but I can't place it. Anyone here recognize
  it?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eurosport-logotype_5783.gif]"

    book by Dover. The typefaces in the book are from the Franklin Photolettering
    Catalog.\r\n\r\nI think we've discussed it here before.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    for a logo I'm recreating for a customer of my company.  It looks like Bald Condensed
    mentioned that this font might be found online available to download (\"Hasn\u2019t
    stopped anyone before. :^)\")\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help me locate this font, I

  body: What I meant is that it doesn't have to be available digitally for someone
    to use it. What did designers do before the computer?
