body: I've designed two fonts that interpolate well between each other, and even produce
  useful extrapolations to a limited extent. If we say one is about light weight and
  the other is extra bold, what blending ratios (in %, 0 being entirely light, 100
  being entirely extra bold, extrapolating outside that range) work well to generate
  a good set of intermediate weights?

  body: Thanks! That's just the info I was looking for, though it does not touch on
    the concept that increasing x-height is sometimes necessary with increasing stroke
    weight. Of course, that's not what I asked about, but it is something I took into
    account in my design, though perhaps crudely. I think that side-topic was discussed
    here some time ago. Off to search.

    higher next to a regular weight?

    the reason you increase xheight as you go up in weight is that there is an illusion
    that the xheight looks smaller in bold weights. The increase is just a compensation
    just like overshoot is a compensation.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: There are even some people who do the same thing at the baseline too (have
    the bolder weights "undershoot" the baseline farther), but I wouldn't know if
    that's generally regarded to be a good idea? I know Miso (the freefont) does it.
