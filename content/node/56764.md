  for the one used in Shakespeare's First Folio. The Renaissance type I'm familiar
  with is all based on things by French and Italian punchcutters: would they have
  been using the same basic type in England (Griffos and Garamonds)? Was there anything
  particular going on in English type during that time?\r\n\r\nThanks very much,\r\nSven"

  body: "According to D.B. Updike: \r\n\r\n\"The end of the sixteenth and the beginning
    of the seventeenth century was signalized by the appearance of Shakespeare's Plays,
    both separately in quarto, and collectively in folio. [ . . . ] The folios were
    printed in double column, with the text in roman and the names of the characters
    in italic; and although the prefatory matter was set in handsome type, the body
    of the work had from a printer's standpoint no particular typographical interest.\"
    [<em>Printing Types,</em> Vol II, p.129]\r\n\r\nEngland did not have as distinguished
    a typographic tradition at that time, not to the same extent as Italian, French,
    or Dutch. I would expect that most Roman types of that period might have been
    imported from the Dutch. And native attempts at types that weren't blackletter
    from that period were generally influenced by the Dutch styles, I believe. \r\n\r\nIf
    you're looking for something digital that suggests the roman types of that era
    in England, you might look at [[http://www.typography.com|H&FJ's]] Historical
    Allsorts or other revivals of the Fell Types (Igino Marini did some, IIRC). Also,
    someone once made a digitization of one of romans cut by Fran\xE7ois Guyot and
    used by John Day (ca. late 1570s, London).\r\n\r\nSorry no links. Someone else
    might be able to link up.\r\n\r\n-- Kent. \r\n"

  body: Ferguson's <em>Pica Roman Type in Elizabethan England</em> demonstrates pretty
    conclusively that the types used in Britain at this time were largely French or
    imports from the Low Countries. The style is predominantly Garamond-like.

    Unfortunately, the font has only the regular weight, no italic, but it's nicely
    done and is available for free.\r\n\r\n\"Day Roman is a digitally redrawn version
    of what has come to be historically known as the \"Two Line Double Pica Roman\",
    a typeface designed by 16th century French punchcutter Francois Guyot, and used
    in numerous books between 1535 and 1570, most notable of which are J. Steelsius's
    printing of The Bible (1541) and Frisius (1551), Gillis Coppens van Diest's printing
    of Erasmus (1544), Georgius (1544), Serlio (1550) and Horatius (1552), and Rotarius's
    printing of Livius Brechtius (1549). The type was also used extensively by H.
    Dunham, and later J. Day, in London (the name Day Roman is simply a reference
    to J. Day having used the type).\""

  body: "A bit late to help Sven, but for the record --\r\n\r\nNot long ago I studied
    the text font of the First Folio and found it was most likely set in Pierre Haultin's
    second pica roman. (More information on this available at my <a href=http://typophile.com/node/66088>Typophile
    blog</a>.) I have one more type family to add to the excellent suggestions on
    this thread so far: <a href=http://mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/verdigris/pk_verdigris.htm>MVB
    Verdigris</a>, which has an italic inspired by that of Haultin."
