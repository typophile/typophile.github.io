  body: "Don't recognize it off hand. Also can't say if this is modern logo making
    or from an old printed text. Depending on the date of your sample it could be
    a digital or photolettering font. Looks sort of like a simplified \"Old English\"
    -- with  a Roman upper case with a textura lower case. Old English dates back
    to about 1760 when it was called Caslon Black. The closest I have seen to your
    image is an alphabet for house letters\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OldEnglishHouseLettersSM_4380.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.accurateimageinc.com/Plastics/F_OldEnglishSet.aspx\r\nalso\r\nhttp://www.accurateimageinc.com/Cut%20Metals/CutOldEnglish.aspx\r\nNot
    available as a digital font.\r\nThe closest digital I found is New Old English
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/new-old-english/ \r\nIf you are lucky another
    font detective may be able to find a match, or at least something closer.\r\nDon"
