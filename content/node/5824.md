body: Our University department is changing its name from Quantitative Management
  to Decision Sciences. Our teaching and research focuses mainly on the mathematics
  underlying decision making and management processes.  <BR> <BR>We need a new logo
  to reflect the new name. It should also give some hint of the fact that mathematics
  is the focus. We played around with the Greek sigma and delta &#40;often used in
  a mathematical context&#41;, roman s and d, and the integration sign. &#40;We shy
  away from the capital Sigma or summation sign because it is overused.&#41; <BR>
  <BR>We &#40;mathematicians, not typographers or designers&#41; came up with the
  following concept. The idea is that it should alternate between a d and an S in
  the mind of the reader. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"

  body: The concept it good. With some refinement &#40;curves, weight, etc.&#41; this
    shape could work quite nicely. As a logo, I would lose the drop shadow and use
    a stronger color against the white

  body: Thanks for the comments, Scott. The first use of the logo would be as background
    design for a preprint cover -- hence the pale colours. &#40;It will have to be
    even paler to prevent it from interfering too much with the black title that will
    be overprinted on the cover...&#41; For other uses it makes sense to have it bolder.
    There are no colours with mathematical significance, as far as I know.  <BR> <BR>Would
    it be better to frame the symbol when it is printed as say red or dark blue on
    white, to get a rectangular logo, or should it be used without a frame?  <BR>
    <BR>Not being designers, we would appreciate any suggestions on refinements of
    the weight, curves, etc. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Chris

  body: C.J., in your latest comment, second paragraph, you ask about the following
    two options <BR> <BR>&#40;a&#41; Dark rectangular shape containing white logo
    <BR>&#40;b&#41; Dark logo <BR> <BR>Often, &#40;b&#41; is to be preferred, as it
    will be the more memorable shape of the two. <BR> <BR>On refinements ... well,
    drop the drop-shadow. No aestethic or functional reasons for keeping it. And regarding
    weight, curves ... yes, there are room for improvement ... but right now I can
    hardly find time to print, scan, draw and post. I will certainly check this thread
    and comment further. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O

  body: I guess it depends on your target audience. As a non-math person, I&#39;d
    have no idea what a sigma was or see it in the mark above. It&#39;s just an &#39;S&#39;
    to me. And I wouldn&#39;t be sure what that had to do with &#39;decision sciences&#39;
    other than perhaps &#42;S&#42;cience.

  body: Like Soren, I don&#39;t have much time to give you a proper diagram illustrating
    corrections to make, but here&#39;s a quick sketch done in photoshop. <BR> <BR><img

    <BR> <BR>The squares mark the primary areas needing curve smoothing/refinement.
    The middle arrow indicates the area where I see the greatest need for consistency
    in weight/thickness relationship. The bottom arrow and lines indicate a curve
    relationship that I think can be improved by pushing the right side out a little.
    <BR> <BR>I also agree with Soren about using the graphic mark without framing
    it. <BR> <BR>As far as the background image goes

  body: There is one straight line in the symbol. It joins the curves two places.
    The upper join is approx 90 degrees. The lower join is more &#39;sharp&#39;. <BR>
    <BR>To me, they should be more alike = I would make the lower joint less &#39;sharp&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>&#40;Gee, it&#39;s tough to describe these matters in a foreign language
    ... but I guess I get a lot of practise here&#41; <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O

  body: 'Current concept looks like arts and craft era.  <BR>I honestly don&#39;t
    like it at all. I do see the S and D but only because I read the post text first.
    It is too much of a jump for the imagination to see the D-S as quickly as a good
    design/logo should be interpreted. Besides I don&#39;t see how this shape expresses
    anything about the orginization. <BR>I will post a different concept by sunday
    night. '

  body: Ole&#39;s critique ... well, I had the same thoughts when I first saw the
    symbol. <BR> <BR>But I think the problem could be a minor one. <BR> <BR>Will there
    be a name close to the symbol? How often? What name? What typography?  <BR>These
    things will determine whether or not you see the &#39;d&#39; and the &#39;s&#39;.  <BR>
    <BR>How about posting a design showing this? <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O

  body: All your comments are much appreciated! <BR> <BR>The symbol will &#40;almost
    always&#41; be accompanied by the words ``Decision Sciences&#39;&#39; or ``Department
    of Decision Sciences&#39;&#39;. In most cases the University logo <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41826.gif"
    alt="unisa">  <BR>will be on the same page. &#40;In the department we do most
    of our typesetting &#40;study material etc.&#41; in Monotype Plantin.&#41;   <BR>
    <BR>Apart from the above, we can still decide on the typography. Again, any suggestions
    will be welcome.  <BR> <BR>Chris

  body: Well it is now monday, and I was just finishing the design/post I had expected
    to upload last night. Logo has s/d combined greek style. With this glyph it is
    also possible to extract some interesting patterns form the counters of the glyph
    &#40;for ornamentation use, background patterns, borders, architecture, etc...&#41;<img

  body: I very much like the fact that your shape can be adapted for backgrounds,
    etc., Ole.  <BR> <BR>The target audience would mainly be students already registered
    for courses in the Department of Decision Sciences, prospective students, and
    to some extent also colleagues from other universities. &#40;The logo will be
    used on study material, brochures explaining what we teach, preprint covers and
    possibly business cards.&#41;  <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Chris

  body: 'CJ: <BR> <BR>The bottom two designs don&#39;t make any sense to me, but I
    like the improvements made in the top two designs. I like that you have created
    a heavier version, but it might be a little too heavy. If the heavier version
    is bold and the lighter version is regular, then you are looking for a medium.
    If you look at your bold version, it looks like it is going to fall over &#40;to
    the right&#41;. To eliminate this unbalance, I have cut off the little returning
    curve from the end of the &#34;S&#34; and I have cut off a significant portion
    of the arm at the beginning of the &#34;S&#34;. <BR> <BR>This is rough, because
    your original JPEGs are very rough/pixelated, but hopefully it will give you an
    idea of what I mean. Also, the bottom probably needs to be a little thicker and
    the top arc might need to be rounded out a little more. I&#39;m not positive about
    the arc, though, because it might only read as an &#34;S&#34;&#39;, whereas, right
    now, it looks unatural, like two shapes are melded together'
