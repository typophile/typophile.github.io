  let me know?\r\nThanks. "

  body: "Angelos Vergetios or Vergikios, depending on the source, of which there are
    several. Proctor (1900, I think) and Scholderer (1927) are fairly standard. Your
    university library should have them. You could also trust your eyes: there are
    very good images of the grec-du-roi online, and there are anthologies of Greek
    scribal hands in print (I can't recall off the top of my head; I'm in a different
    country from my library).\r\n\r\n  "
