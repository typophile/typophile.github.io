    generic font has that great feature, but Adobe&#39;s only remaining resident designer,
    the great Slimbach, never puts traps in his work! Even the smallest, darkest sizes
    of Minion don&#39;t have any. In contrast, Miriad does have traps - I guess that
    was Twombly&#39;s doing - and maybe one reason they didn&#39;t get along... Even
    Twombly&#39;s earliest designs &#40;like Mirarae&#41; have wonderful traps. <BR>

  body: <i>What are traps?</i> <BR> <BR>Inktraps. This term originally referred to
    those parts of a letter in which there was a tendency for ink to build up. Tight
    angles, such as the inside of the bottom of the letter v can be inktraps. The
    problem is exacerbated in some printing processes, by ink consistency, and also
    by the heaviness of coverage; it is particularly problematic in heavy types such
    as black sans serifs. Nowadays, the term is often used, as Tiffany and Hrant are
    using it, in reference to the technique used to correct letterforms to avoid this
    problem. This typically involves taking a nick out of the ink trap area to compensate
    for the build up of ink, or otherwise lightening that part of the letter, e.g.
    by tapering stems as in the v shown above. <BR> <BR>Adobe Sans is a Multiple Master
    font that includes a weight axis from very light to extremely black. The inktrap
    correction becomes much more obvious as the weight increases.

    <BR> <BR>BTW, what&#39;s really interesting about traps is that they don&#39;t
    just counteract gain &#40;which is often not pronounced enough to fret about&#41;,
    they also compensate for human optical strangeness &#40;at small sizes&#41;. <BR>

    I&#39;m not mistaken, this typeface along with Adobe Serif weren&#39;t ever designed
    to be actually used. Were they? In the same sense that I use Garamond. They are
    strictly replacement fonts, right? Especially in display sizes. I would assume
    anyway. At smaller sizes the trap in the v would compensate and actually make
    the v look visually correct. At least that is how I understand it.

  body: '<i>&#62;Why would they make nicks in the photo days?</i> <BR> <BR>Gerald,
    nicks were used in photofilm for essentially the same reason that &#34;ink traps&#34;
    were used in metal, only in reverse. If you project light through an open shape
    with an acute angle, the light will tend to make the corner round. My recollection
    of physics and optics is a little fuzzy, but I think the phenomenon is called
    &#34;diffraction&#34; &#40;or is it &#34;diffusion&#34;?&#41;. This is basically
    the same principle that causes dappled light filtered through trees to appear
    as round, circular projections on the ground, even though the openings between
    leaves are random polygonal shapes. I believe the degree of rounding varies depending
    upon the thickness of the film substrate. <BR> <BR>You can try this experiment:
    Take a piece of card stock &#40;a 3x5 index card works well&#41; and cut a square
    opening in it, say half and inch or so. Place the card on a piece of paper and
    shine a desk lamp directly over it. Now, lift the edge of the card just slightly
    so that you can peek under and see the projected square of light on the paper.
    You&#39;ll notice that the corners of the projected square are not sharp. The
    closer the card is to the paper the sharper the image, but there will still be
    slight rounding in the corners. Nicks were used to compensate for this rounding.
    <BR> <BR>Karen, a &#34;nick&#34; -- Hrant&#39;s &#34;thorn&#34; is a little more
    descriptive -- is where an outside corner is exaggerated in its sharpness.  It&#39;s
    basically the negative image of the &#34;trap&#34; discussed above. <BR> <BR>I
    hope that&#39;s clear. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'

    thorns are not as obscure in digital as one might think. This morning I was looking
