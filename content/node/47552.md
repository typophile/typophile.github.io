  body: "Newsflash!!! Blackbeard was found drowned today in Narraganset Bay. It seems
    he had stolen lead type and overloaded his galley. The galley sunk with all aboard.
    Blackbeard's body was found by unsuspecting quohoggers. Blackbeard's family was
    out of sorts when they heard the news.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
