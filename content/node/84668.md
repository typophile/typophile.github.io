  Serif</a> (which appears to be quite lovely, by the way\u2014has anybody licensed
  it and is willing to share experiences?) and found myself bewildered at the following
  sight in the preview PDF:\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/exposerif_6006.png]\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
  quite short an \u2018f\u2019 descender, isn\u2019t it? The \u2018g\u2019 is not
  as short as that, but also looks distinctly on the short side. The descenders of
  italic lowercase letters in every old style typeface I inspected, by contrast, all
  had the same optical length. The same seems to be true of every sans I checked\u2014with
  the exception of <a href=\"http://www.typeculture.com/foundry/font_collection/font.php?ID=FNT02\">Expo
  Sans</a>:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/exposans_3454.png]\r\nDo you
  know any similar examples? How do you feel about visible differences in descender
  length? I admittedly did not even notice this peculiarity when I looked at the Expo
  family for the first time a couple of months ago. Now it makes me shrink back from
  licensing. Thoughts on why the \u2018f\u2019 is so short are also welcome although,
  of course, only the designer can elucidate how this came about.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance for any helpful contributions!"

    Meta Serif. I think there's plenty of these. \r\nIf Expo Serif's /f/ looks unbalanced,
    it might be even more that the descender struggles to balance a quite generous
    hood at the top of the letter, rather than that it doesn't come down as far as
    /p/ etc."

    short \u2018f\u2019 descender a historical revival or an innovation of this century?
    Meta Serif, Tisa and Expo all are less than five years old. I was wondering whether
    the short descender serves any practical purpose I fail to see or whether it is
    rather a quirk that typeface designers might introduce depending on their taste."

    different ascender and descender lengths appears totally reasonable to me, both
    on practical and aesthetic accounts. But why would you make the descender of just
    <cite>one</cite> letter shorter than the others? And if you decide on doing so,
    why the \u2018f\u2019? As far as I can see it doesn\u2019t look nice(r) and it
    doesn\u2019t solve any problems, which is why I reckon it to be a stylistic variant.
    Please put me right, if necessary."

    would have thought the reason for that is <em>obvious</em>.\r\n\r\nThe lowercase
    f normally has a descender in <em>italics</em>. It normally does not have a descender
    in the Roman.\r\n\r\nHence, if one is designing a typeface that is to have a slightly
    cursive feel to it, one might give the f a partial descender in the Roman.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, if one wants to \"modernize\" the italic of a typeface, make it
    less cursive, but more like a sloped italic, then one might shorten the descender
    of the f without eliminating it entirely.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is particularly
    common, but it's something that might occur to people when trying to design a
    typeface that is \"just a little bit cursive\". It might indeed be a horrible
    mistake when they do it, just as you say."

    \u2018f\u2019 is one of the very few letters that grow a descender in italics
    (well, not <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_profile_pro_regular_italic/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=120&sample_text=qgpfyjxa&ft=liga&acs_pt=32\">always</a>).\r\n\r\nInterestingly
    I find the shortened \u2018f\u2019 to work quite well in Tisa, especially when
    there are no letters with a longer descender immediately adjacent (what I <cite>do</cite>
    find distracting is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_tisa_pro_regular_italic/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=120&sample_text=affable&ft=liga&acs_pt=32\">this</a>
    ligature). The absence of a sweep to the left seems to make the unusual length
    more tolerable. In most other typefaces you mentioned the discrepancy feels unbalanced
    to me or at least as if they forgot to apply optical correction."
