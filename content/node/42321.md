  something about those big strong serifs. Some sort of misdirected need for a sense
  of grounding in my life which I fill through my choice of type. If anyone reads
  this, I need a good list of slab-serif's to fill this hole, in my sole.\r\n\r\n<cite>\r\nIf
  anyone knows what typeface this is, I would be in love with you for enlightening
  me. Thanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/umbrella_5716.gif]"
