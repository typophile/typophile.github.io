body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nalmost three years after Robothon\u201912, where I first
  presented Speed Punk to the public, I stopped selling it \xBBby email\xAB and started
  selling it online instead.\r\n\r\nPlease have a look at [[https://yanone.de/buy/]]
  and point all potential users and students there.\r\nI offer student discount after
  account registration.\r\n\r\nPersonal side note: I started the shop from scratch,
  written all in Python. Should you run into any trouble or inconsistencies, please
  let me know.\r\n\r\nA note to all previous buyers of Speed Punk, by email or through
  the CDs I sold on Robothon:\r\nYou have received personalized voucher codes for
  the new online shop in a text file together with the plugins, one each for the versions
  for RoboFont and Glyphs.app.\r\nYou may register at the shop and use these voucher
  codes to \xBBpurchase\xAB the plugins for free, which will establish a proper customer
  relationship between us and will enable you to receive future updates for the software
  (make sure to keep that setting ticked upon registration).\r\nThere are still no
  updates available at the moment, still 1.0. But a minor bug fix release for the
  Glyphs.app version might become necessary soon, after I have tried to convince Georg
  that the bug is on his side and that I followed his recommendations at the time
  ;)\r\nAnd I\u2019m looking into releasing a feature update in summer.\r\n\r\nNext
  up: I need to make a video explaining Speed Punk.\r\nThank you."
