body: "Hello, \r\nThis is my debut typeface (which is still untitled).\r\nWhat initially
  meant to be modular serif inspired by arab calligraphy, turned out into somewhat
  modernist base with elements used by older serif typeface styles. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Glyphs_4223.JPG]\r\nSome
  glyphs still need work - namely N, Q, X, f, x, 4, 8.\r\nAlso I haven't started to
  work on kerning yet.\r\nAnd FL technical features are like a plane cockpit to me.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Waterfall_5032.JPG]\r\nThese
  analogues are the closest of what I managed to find:\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/sahara-bodoni/|Sahara

    treatment at the bottom right of /n/m/h/, I think you should let it dip below
    the baseline a touch more. Those terminals look like they're riding high.\r\n\r\nI
    think you've identified well the letters that need the most work. I'm also not
    sure about /q/'s descender, and /t/ might be too wimpy above the crossbar."

  body: "I love extra bold didones included yours :)\r\nthanks for your comment on
    my post. \r\nI agree whit eliason +\r\n\xB7maybe the terminal lower-right of /u/
    should has the same shape as /n/ ?\r\n\xB7a bit big left serif of /A/\r\n\xB7
    the lower /K/ leg seems outstanding to me\r\n\xB7 right /Y/ arm isn't going too
    much left?\r\n"

  body: "This is the opposite direction from the charset. Because then both V and
    X would have to be changed.\r\nIt's not the junction, but inner space balance
    I can't figure out. Notice the huge left serif I made to close that gap.\r\nWhat
    I am trying to do is to find that \"magical\" condensed \"V\" to clone and form
    \"W\"."
