body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Case</strong>\r\n\r\nIn current practice,
  usage of the term case most likely refers to the use of uppercase (capital) or lowercase
  letters. See some examples below. In [[Letterpress|letterpress]] practice, case
  refers to the physical box (case), usually wooden, that a given set of letters is
  stored. Capital letters were stored in the upper (top) case and lowercase letters
  were stored in the lower (bottom) case.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nALL CAPS -- All
  letters are capitalized.\r\n\r\nTitle Case -- The first letter of each word is capitalized.\r\n\r\nSentence
  case -- where the first character is capital and the remaining words are lowercase.\r\n\r\nCamel
  Case -- Also called internal caps where one or more characters in a given word (or
  string) has a capitalized letter. This is often used in programming languages and
  increasingly seen for naming or branding companies or products.\r\n\r\n<strong>[[Indices]]
