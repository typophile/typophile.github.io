body: "I've noted in a lot of my older Spanish texts the capital italic is less angled
  than the lowercase.  It's an effect I quite like, but I'll be damned if I can't
  get it to look right in my own tests.  My lowercase angle is 17 degrees, and I first
  tried 12-13 for the uppercase, but it's not different enough.  Going much straighter
  though and it doesn't seem much different from an ever-so-slightly oblique of the
  roman.\r\n\r\nWhat are some successfull set ups y'all have found?  Should punctuation
  and symbols follow the same angle as the lowercase or the uppercase?  Also, do y'all
  think it's a good idea if doing the differently-angled uppercase to include a stylistic
  set at the original angle for those who prefer everything to fall over the same?\r\n\r\nI
  could have sworn I've seen this talked about somewhere but neither google nor the
  forum search pulls up much for advice on this."

  body: "And answering my own question ... 17 for lowercase and 10 for uppercase works
    quite nicely.  But I'm still not quite decided on whether punctuation should be
    at the lowercase or uppercase angle.  I'm included to think lowercase so I'll
    go with that for now unless it looks totally out of place.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro

  body: 'Generally speaking I believe that old style italics have many different angles
    involved, and not just of upper and lower case. For example, in the original Caslon
    fonts the italic l is generally less sloped than the left leg of the ''n''--and
    the right leg is steeper than the left. And K is less sloped than the H and on
    and on. '
