  case they want a modern progressive typeface but their clients are deeply conservative.
  They have rejected the beautiful didot that I came up with, probably rightly and
  are looking for sans serif faces- they like frutiger. I was wondering if any one
  knows of a more sans serif font that still has the two loops in the g (whats the
  technical name for this?) but is more modern. meta is closest but the g and t dont
  work well together- I could cut a bit off the t. ANY SUGGESTIONS?\r\n\r\nvery grateful-

    would suggest <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/\">Apex New</a>
    for one.\r\n\r\nand if they like Meta, maybe consider <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=unit&x=0&y=0&sample_text=gtp&sample_size=96\">FF
    Unit</a>"

  body: Thanks- good suggestions although the meta one looks like its got a spring
    in it and is about to bounce away much like its designer! - I'm going to sleep
    on  this now and hopefully wake up to lots of inspiring suggestions.
