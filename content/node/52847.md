body: "I was hoping I could get a bit of advice from you clever people about the choice
  of typeface for a book I'm working on.\r\n\r\nThe text, a rather unconventional
  \"autobiography\" composed of prose pieces of varying lengths along with some poems,
  seems to me to need a light serif face, rounded rather than spiky, not too condensed,
  attractive but not \"showy\". One typeface that immediately suggested itself was
  <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-souvenir/\">Souvenir</a>: I
  don't actually think much of it as a face, but like the overall look it gives to
  a page.\r\n\r\nIf I had to choose from what we already have, it would probably be
  between <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/trump+mediaeval/fonts/\">Trump Mediaeval</a>,
  <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/perpetua/fonts/\">Perpetua</a> and <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bell-mt/\">Bell</a>.
  None of them is quite right (respectively: too sharp, too small and too irregular-looking),
  and the versions we have (Bitstream for the first two, plus a Bell that came with
  the machine) aren't really up to scratch.\r\n\r\nMy boss isn't too keen on faces
  that have sharp and/or over-detailed serifs, so that's another limitation.\r\n\r\nThe
  book will be four-colour throughout, with plenty of photographs (colour and black
  and white) mixed in with the text. The paper will therefore be coated and around
  120gsm (sorry, I don't know what this is equivalent to in non-metric paper weight).
  We need the paper to be high-white for the photographs, which isn't ideal for the
  text, so we're looking into the feasibility of putting a very light creamy tint
  behind the text and blank parts of the page.\r\n\r\nSize-wise, we're thinking 10
  to 11 pt (depending on the x-height of the face) on 14pt, but might need to go higher
  on the leading.\r\n\r\nWe don't want to break the bank on this, but obviously for
  a book of this magnitude a couple of hundred pounds/dollars/euros will be a drop
  in the ocean. I'm keen to use something new rather than a revival, but would also
  like to be able to use it for other books in the future.\r\n\r\nI hope that's enough
  information to get you going!"

    a sturdy text typeface. Feijoa by Kris Sowersby might fit your bill?"

    I have used it regularly for poetry and other books. \r\nIt has a very balanced

    affordable."

  body: "Dolly will create a color on the page reminiscent of Souvenir (which you
    mentioned). It's weight and low contrast will hold up well on coated stock (although
    it might feel a little out of place in that environment, since it feels more natural
    on a warm, uncoated stock). But Dolly is not \"light.\"\r\n\r\nAs another alternative
    for consideration, I might somewhat immodestly suggest [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman|Whitman]].
    It is light, somewhat rounded in feeling, and not too fancy.\r\n\r\nWhitman shares
    some characteristics with Trump Mediaeval, but is not as angular or oldstyle in
    its forms. It has some of the simplicity of Perpetua, but sets a bit larger (not
    as large as Trump), is not as quirky, and is not nearly as brittle in contrast.
    \r\n\r\nIt's moderate contrast keeps it from becoming brittle on coated stock.
    If the color is a bit too light, then the recently released Semibold is just a
    tad darker and a suitable alternative for text when a slightly richer color is
    desired.\r\n\r\nYou can judge its performance in a variety of sample text settings
    in several sizes & leadings in my original PDF, downloadable from: www.kentlew.com/WhitmanOverview.html
    (not updated with latest weights, however).\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Many thanks for these suggestions. No final decisions have been made yet,
    but I've gone as far as to buy Feijoa (very nice indeed), which looks as if it
    will suit another book design even if we don't end up using it for the one I originally
    described. \r\n\r\nI'd love to have an excuse to buy Dolly! I've been eyeing that
    one up for ages. As for Whitman - new to me, but very much to my taste. It reminds
    me a little of both Joanna and Scala, but I suspect it would work much better
    as an \"uncontentious\" text face than either of them. I'm particularly pleased
    that it has a proper semi-bold weight. It's a little pricey, given the current
    dollar/sterling exchange rate, but if we ever do a comprehensive redesign of our
    standard house style, then I think it'll will be very high on my list of possible
    faces."

    \r\nAnd you get a very usable bookface for that."

    was, in fact, precisely the intention & impetus behind the design. I'm glad you
    like it.\r\n\r\n<cite> > It\u2019s a little pricey, given the current dollar/sterling
    exchange rate, </cite>\r\n\r\nEven with the dollar as weak as it is? You do realize
    that Font Bureau has quantity discounts built in to their pricing? For a single-user
    license, the per-font cost drops from $40 to $35 with four fonts, and again down
    to $30 for six or more. (This applies regardless of family or style, BTW). (Also,
    note that the Whitman styles are delivered with both the LF and OsF versions for
    a single license.)\r\n\r\nI can't really compare Whitman to what you paid for
    Feijoa, since the latter is fully-featured OpenType with pretty extensive character
    sets. But comparing with the Dolly quote above, you can get the equivalent four
    styles of Whitman for $140 USD (\xA392,50 GBP).\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough with the
    hard sell ;-) If you should ever wish to explore further, and if a PDF sample
    of some of your own text set to your own specifications would be of assistance,
    contact me directly and I'd be happy to discuss options.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"
