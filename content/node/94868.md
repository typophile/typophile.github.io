  term have I seen used here to refer to what kinds of top-serifs are on these letters
  /b/d/h/k/l/ ?\r\n\r\nFor a bonus, please list any fonts you know of (not pictured
  here) that use 'em.\r\n\r\nTHAAAAANKS.\r\n"

    http://www.typeforge.net/blog/2012/06/22/illustrated-typeface-anatomy-terminology/\r\n\r\nI
    have seen such serifs refered to as obtuse serifs I believe.   These at near 45
    degree angles on lower case characters are common in \"old style\" serif fonts.
    \ So if you search for old style fonts you should be able to find what you are
    looking for.   e.g. http://www.myfonts.com/search/old+style/fonts/  There are
    a few with the double serifs like your example in the results"

    Jenson revivals, such as my Goodchild.\r\nDouble-sided ascender serifs are rare;
    notably in Koch Antiqua, from which I appropriated the idea for Oneleigh."

  body: "So, angled double-sided obtuse ascender head serifs?\r\n\r\nThat's a mouthful.\r\n\r\nPaul,
    thanks. Hrant, I've seen Houston and MT Italian Old Style; their ascender head-serifs
    aren't double-sided. Nick, I'll say it again: your Goodchild is beautiful."
