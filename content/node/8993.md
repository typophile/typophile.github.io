    page isn&#39;t correct, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be an easy way to get it
    display the proper character.

  body: Thank you very much. <BR> <BR>Once I retyped it, and looked it over, it became
    clear that it was either tooled with, or lost a bunch of it&#39;s originality
    over the years. <BR> <BR>The &#34;A&#34; has a dip on the top, and most of the
    &#34;Tails&#34; &#34;Feet&#34; have been rounded off, or again, just lost it&#39;s
    shape over the years. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll print it out using the font, and show
    the customer. <BR> <BR>Thanks again

  body: I would say that this logo was done pre-PC or at least using pre-PC methods,
    and that the shapes have been distorted a bit through reproduction, scanning,
    and/or possibly redrawing over the years. <BR> <BR>Also, there are often slight
    differences between digitizations of fonts and other versions of them. ITC used
    to send master artwork out to its licensees but licensees were responsible for
    adapting it to their particular font format, leaving room for some interpretation
    and leading to subtle but noticeable differences between different vendors&#39;
    versions of ITC fonts. <BR> <BR>The Bitstream version seems to be the only digital
    version of this font. <a href="http://itcfonts.com/fonts/" target="_blank">ITC</a>
    doesn&#39;t even carry it. It was one of the first fonts they released in 1970
    when they began and it&#39;s almost like they have disowned some of those early
    releases. Not hip enough for them, I guess.

  body: ITC Grouch was in the old Image Club Letterpress CD&#39;s &#40;pre-Adobe,
    that is&#41;, and it looks like their version also had the dip on top of the A.  I
    wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the fonts came from Bitstream versions.  Grant Hutchinson
    would probably know. <BR> <BR>However, I have a 1998 ITC Catalog &#40;U &amp;lc
    Vol 25 No. 2&#41; showing ITC Grouch with that same characteristic, so I assume
    that is how it should be.

  body: Mike, it wasn&#39;t from Bitstream. <BR> <BR>At Image Club &#40;this was back
    in early 1989&#41;, we used 2 inch Varityper film supplied by VGC for our digitization
    of ITC Grouch.
