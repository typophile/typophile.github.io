body: "(No, not ligatures for FF Meta...)\r\n\r\nOne of my fascinations in the field
  of \"visible language\" are shapes\r\nthat stand for more than one letter. It's
  interesting to consider how\r\nthey combine, what parts are \"important\", and how
  the recognition of\r\nthe components is weighted (intentionally or not), when alone
  or even\r\nmore interestingly in the contexts of words. I can't stop thinking of\r\nthis
  topic, even in banal places like Dairy Queen, where I daydream\r\nweather a logo
  that's a \"D\" with a tail would work (or maybe it would\r\ndrive their loyal customer
  base back to the mountains.)\r\n\r\nBelow is something I did when working on Trajic
  notRoman, years ago.\r\nBut more than show what I've done (not much anyway, really)
  I'd like\r\nto collect and compile examples you guys might have seen. Please let\r\nme
  know of any metaligatures that you think are worth thinking about!\r\n\r\n(Oh, and
  as always I'm open to terminological\r\nsuggestions as to what to call these things.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    you can't tell whether something like that is legible or not. I think I have a

    by one glyph. i wonder if you could do the same for the GHT and then have a three
    letter/ligature (now i want to ligate whole words -- ha!) spelling of the word
    knight.\r\none combo that i kept seeing in slides at typecon is the lc \"ra\"

    that space by ligating the exit stroke of the arm of the r with the entry stroke
    of the a... whatcha think?"

    idea, which is a mainstay of the \"compressed\" ligature, is that where there
    is a repeated vertical stem, one is removed in a kind of \"negative kerning\"
    exercise, and the remaining stem does double duty. In a logo, this provides a
    point of visual interest.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar idea in the \"fi\" ligature,
    where the ball of the f serves as the dot on the \"i\", but the purpose is different:
    it could be considered as the removal of visual stutter.\r\n\r\nAnother category
    of compressions: as in the Avant Garde ligatures, where the purpose is to enable
    justification of tight-set headlines."
