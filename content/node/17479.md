  body: "i was just searching for Bailey and i couldn't find it. there's a font called
    ITC Bailey that keeps coming up but it's totally different. \r\n\r\ni saw Bailey
    (by Lettergraphics) in the Feb 06 issue of HOW in an article called Foxy Fonts
    by Allan Haley (page 80). the article is about typefaces designed during the 60s
    and 70s.\r\nwhen i saw this sample i assumed that whoever designed the font-in-question
    based it on Bailey.\r\n\r\nStark seems like a decent match, but there's got to
    be a digital version of Bailey out there somewhere because i know i've seen it\u2026\r\n\r\n--------------
