  it's irrelevant to a good amount of design work) but it's got to the point now that
  I need some helpful pointers from the massed genius of the posters here.\r\n\r\nThat
  is, for the different type of bindings, is there any rule of thumb I can use when
  designing a page so that my attractive layout isn't chewed up into the gutter when
  the book's bound? I've tried to 'talk to my printers'(there's two we use) but we're
  a small concern and only do short runs and I get the sense that they don't and won't
  want to spend any time on us.\r\n\r\nHelp! "

  body: "Your printer should be able to provide you with a dummy book, using the right
    paper and something close to the final binding. \r\nThe general rule of thumb
    I have is if you're worried about it, it's probably too tight. "

  body: "The printer should tell you how much of the sheet will be eaten up by the
    binding. That leaves you with aesthetic decision regarding your own margin. The
    two added together is what you'd want to use.\r\n\r\nNote that some binding methods
    will also introduce creep into the equation that you'll want to account for. "

  body: "<li><strong>Saddle stitch:</strong> You should be safe with a minimum 1/2-inch
    back margin. If it's a low page count (up to 32) you can probably get away with
    even less, though I wouldn't recommend it.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Mechanical bindings
    (wire-o, spiral, etc.):</strong> Keep type at least 1/4 inch away from the holes
    that are drilled for the wires.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Perfect binding:</strong>
    Minimum 5/8-inch back margin, 3/4-inch is better. It's not so much a question
    of the type getting \"chewed up,\" it's the fact that the pages don't lie flat
    in a perfect bound book, so the last 3/4 inch curves steeply away from the reader's
    eye.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Smyth sewing:</strong> Sewn pages lie flatter than perfect
    bound pages, and Smyth sewing doesn't involve any grind-off like perfect binding,
    so you can get away with a minimum 1/2 inch. But Smyth sewing is usually reserved
    for better-quality casebound books, so don't skimp on your margins.</li>\r\n\r\nOne
    more thing. When readers look at a book, they don't see a page, they see a spread,
    so if your back margin and front margin are equal, the space between the two type
    blocks looks too big. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PAGES2_4397.jpg]\r\nYour
    back margin ought to be smaller than your front margin (and your head margin smaller
    than your foot margin).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PAGES_4256.jpg]"
