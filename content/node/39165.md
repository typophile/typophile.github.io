  So i have to watch out for good design-tools - I know TypeTool, but what you think
  about FontLab?\r\n\r\nI used TypeTool to integrate some customer logos - but i guess
  to create a proffessional font i need a stronger tool.\r\n\r\nmy second question
  is about Typedesign knowledge - are there any books available about this topic?\r\n\r\ncan
  anybody give me some tips!\r\n\r\nthanks a lot, alex\r\n\r\n"
