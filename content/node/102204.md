  design agencies recently (see attached) and I really like the cut off part on the
  leg of the uppercase R and some of the other letters.\r\n\r\nI was just wondering
  if anyone knew what it was called?\r\n\r\nHere's my email address if anyone can
  help us with this conundrum!\r\n\r\nrob@designbyday.co.uk\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n
