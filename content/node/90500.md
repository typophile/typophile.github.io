    to/from TT\r\npoints get added (to approximate).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "In terms of curve definitions, there are two: cubic (PS)\r\nand quadratic
    (TT). Most people design in the former, but\r\nmost actual fonts end up in TT
    format. Ideally you design\r\nin the same curve definition model as the output
    format,\r\nbut most people never get comfortable (or bother getting\r\ncomfortable)
    designing in quadratics.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
