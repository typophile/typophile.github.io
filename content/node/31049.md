body: Anyone have a good recommendation for a San Serif font, Bold or Black (thick)
  with stems that are nearly the same width? I am working on a logo and need a letter
  'F' that has equal or near equal parts.

  body: Good ol' Futura could work, but <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Nobel>Nobel</a>
    or <a href=http://typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html>Gotham</a> could be
    more interesting choices. The "problem" is that many typefaces are optically balanced
    to compensate for the human eye's differing perception of the thicknesses of vertical
    and horizontal lines, meaning that often the horizontals are made slightly thinner
    to create the illusion that they are the same width as the verticals. So finding
    a font with perfectly equal horizontals and verticals might actually not be ideal,
    as it would not appear that way. But then again, you might already know this.

    and edit the 'F'.
