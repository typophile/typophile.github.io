  body: "Hi, I studied at Centro de Estudios Gestalt (first generation, 2004).\r\n\r\nWell,
    I must admit that Reading is more focused in type design, given the fact that
    the master in Gestalt is divided into two halves: on the first one you design
    a typeface (for text, most commonly the regular weight) but on the second half
    you work WITH type (logos, composition, typography\u2026).\xB6 Another big difference
    is that classes at Gestalt are in Spanish, mostly by Mexican teachers (and some
    international guests). \xB6 If you are more interested about the details in type
    design and you can afford it, then you must go to Reading: the list of both the
    teachers and the people who have studied there is quite impressive. On the other
    hand, the master at Gestalt is not bad either: the typefaces designed by the students
    are usually selected at the [[http://fontfeed.com/archives/tipos-latinos-2010/|Tipos
    Latinos Biennial]] and, if I am allowed to make a bit of self-promotion, I guess
    it tells something about the master that I have received the Certificate of Excellence
    in Type Design by the TDC competition twice (2008, 2010).\r\n\r\nIf you need more
    information about Gestalt, drop me a line.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
