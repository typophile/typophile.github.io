body: "I just got a JF Rosart Specimen book. It's from 1973 and is a facsimile of
  the 1768 edition he put out. Oddly enough it was printed in the GDR. The book was
  put together by Fernand Baudin and Netty Hoeflake. \r\n\r\nDoes anybody else have
  this book? If so or no what do you think of it as a reference & why? Is there anything
  I should keep my eyes open for?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
