  to the custom typeface created for Maker's Mark Whisky.  I'm pretty positive it's
  custom, but if anyone knows of a similar typeface (or the actual name of the Maker's
  typeface), please let me know!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/14_4642.jpg]"

  body: "Hey there,\r\n\r\nYou're right, it is a custom typeface made my Marjorie
    Samuels (wife of Bill who created the bourbon), she got the idea from the \"Maker's
    Mark\" stamps on the pewter she collected.  I couldn't find the name that typeface
    has now, but hope that helps as a starting point!"
