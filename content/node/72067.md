  the signage creation for this fine building? I've exhasted my resources to no avail.
  \r\n\r\nhttp://twitpic.com/23gmxw\r\n\r\nPS sorry about the picture quality - the
  building is undergoing maintenance work and this is the closest I could get to the
  signage!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nPaul"

  body: 'I think what you''re seeing is a signmaker''s fancy. The O suggests a style
    commonly referred to as Concave, but the R and A don''t fit that style. Plus,
    the U appears to be flopped: the spur would normally appear on the right side
    of the letter.'
