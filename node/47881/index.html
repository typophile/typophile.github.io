<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi there,
I'm proabbly not even at the right forum :D but I have absolutely no idea where to start.
I work with music notation and there is a font on the market called Opus Note Names - it has letters inside the musical notation. However, this font doesn't suit all our needs so we thought we'd try to make our own.
The problem is - can you make a font that is already coloured? (See, I have no idea about fonts at all :D) I ask, because we want anything that is white in our font *not* to be transparent. As it is, anything white can actually be seen through. I'm looking for some kind of white fill to put on the white bits of the font.
Any help for an utter novice will be appreciated.
Thank you for your patience!</div>

<div class=commentbody>This is a function of the software, not the font. The software has to support coloring the font white (or whatever your chosen color is).
Cheers,
T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey Thomas, thank you for your reply! Ok then, I currently have Typetools, I don't know if it does it. Can you recommend any software in particular?
Thank you again :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nearly all modern software that handles styled text can change the color of the text too. Even with that, the whole character would still be a single color. Applying multiple colors to rendered fonts takes any variety of graphic design programs to do.
I have no idea how that might be handled with the more specialized nature of musical notation layout tools, though.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Righto, thank you :)
The problem is that the music staff lines can be seen through any white bit on that font, making the letters extremely difficult to read.
"Even with that, the whole character would still be a single color."
Do you mean that I cannot have black and white in the same character? (Eg, the black cirle, white centre, black letter?)
This is all beginning to look very complicated :D</div>

<div class=commentbody>I mean that a character can have a single opaque color. For example, an "e" could be any solid color with a transparent hole through it, which would appear white so long as the background is white, but you cannot have an "i" that has a black shaft but also a red dot without using some graphics software that can separate the parts.
The holes in the letters like "e" are not white, but transparent (i.e, there is nothing there). If you are laying text over the music staff, the intersecting lines will appear between the letters and through these holes. You will either have to reduce the size of the type so it fits between the lines or move it to a non-interfering area outside the staff.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think I understand what you want. You could create separations; that is, two fonts with identical metrics, one with the outlines and one with the fills. Then when you're using the font, you would duplicate your finished "text", change the font to the fill font, change the color to white, and put it behind the original (and in front of the staff). Of course, you would have to do that over again every time you changed something.
However, I think the easiest solution to your <em>specific</em> problem might be instead to incorporate the staff into the font. For the purposes it will be used for, do you expect to be combining the notes into chords?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi there, apologies for bumping an old topic. We are revisiting this issue again so I thought I'd write back in here instead of starting a new topic.
The notes will be combined into chords, yes. I create all of my scores in Finale (or perhaps Sibelius for these particular scores). Most things are automatic (stave lines etc).
I don't know why they would make this font and advertise it when it looks so terrible. And there is definitely no font designing program which will fill the transparent space with white? (If my company were to create their own notation font).
Thank you again....</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's hard to say what will work with your music composition programs. It looks like you could color notes white in Sibelius, creating a backdrop with the appropriate gaps. But I don't know if it will allow you to make a duplicate layer without the stave lines.</div>
