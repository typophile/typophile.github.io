  2 typefaces in the GIF but if you happen to know those I'm not going to complain
  :)  \r\nThanks !\r\n\r\n- Sandro\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in seeing it in

  body: "I believe you can do better than that, since the lower case is very close
    to a number of formal script styles. (I think the 'O' is not from a script face
    at all -- probably an italic 'O'.)  \r\n\r\nFor the lower case, have a look at
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/shelley-script/\">Shelley Andante</a>
    (or Allegro, for that matter, since the l.c. is the same). Others could be Palace
    Script, or Embassy Script, but you would want to flatten and bold them a bit.
    Look for the un-looped ascenders. There are a number in the Solotype Catalog in
    the Z-families, so this may have come from a film type.  Some were digitized.\r\n\r\n-
