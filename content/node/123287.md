  (no top loop); dropped left quote marks (which are a characteristic of some European
  languages other than English); markedly right-offset dot to the i. Are there any
  other notable book fonts (i.e. not speciality fonts) that include one or other of
  these features. Many thanks, Anthony\r\n\r\n"

    a pretty funky question mark).

  body: "Montaigne and even Eusebius offset the dot on the i as well - but only to
    a small extent compared with the Doves type. This is because Jenson's own original
    roman face offset the dot on the i; and many modern Jensons don't include this
    feature, as it is (and I think correctly) perceived as limiting the potential
    usefulness of a typeface.\r\n\r\nThus, even Centaur and Cloister Lightface don't
    do this. So, except for a Jenson aiming at maximum authenticity, the offset tittle
    is likely something you will hardly find anywhere. As to the question mark, the
    specimens I saw in a brief search didn't include it, but I think I've seen such
    question marks before, so there may be possibilities there."
