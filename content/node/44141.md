body: "OK, I've been hearing about Web 2.0 and AJAX and Ruby on Rails and Amazon web
  services etc for too long now. And every one of these new sites I view all still
  use Arial and Verdana and Times and Georgia to display their text. Boring. These
  are the same fonts that were around at the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Internet%20Tidal%20Wave%20memo\"
  target=\"_blank\">start of the web</a> (or very soon after). Microsoft released
  their suite of core web fonts and that was it. No more progress on the typography
  front.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying Microsoft has to step up again. In fact it's unlikely
  they will. They've got some <a href=\"http://www.ascendercorp.com/ctfonts.html\">beautiful
  new fonts</a> that shipped with Vista (and to the consternation of the Vista product
  managers, the latest version of Office as well). But while one can <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=048DC840-14E1-467D-8DCA-19D2A8FD7485&amp;displaylang=en\">get
  these fonts freely on the web</a>, they will never be widely licensed for distribution.\r\n\r\nBut
  what I don't understand is why others haven't picked up the slack here. There are
  some really nice free fonts out there (many of which have been featured on <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/fonts/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Smashing Magazine</a>) that could easily be included in the Firefox
  distribution\u2014like <a href=\"http://www.kpao.org/2007/12/best-free-fonts.html\"
  target=\"_blank\">these for example</a>.\r\n\r\nOr how about Adobe? They have amazing
  reach with both <i>Flash</i> and <i>Acrobat Reader</i>, and they also have <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/\"
  target=\"_blank\">an amazing library of typefaces</a>. How about it Adobe? How about
  picking up the slack here and giving a bit back to the Internet community that made
  you the powerhouse you are today?\r\n\r\nOr Google? They licensed the <a href=\"http://www.ascendercorp.com/pr/pr2007_11_12.html\"
  target=\"_blank\">Droid fonts</a> for their Android phone platform. How about extending
  use of these fonts to computers as well? They've got plenty of client installs (Google
  Desktop, Toolbar, Talk, Pack...) they could bundle fonts with.<br /><br />Ah well,
  I'm not holding my breath. I'm still going to use <a href=\"http://novemberborn.net/sifr3\"
  target=\"_blank\">SIFR</a> for my designs. And for the love of everything that is
  beautifully designed, I encourage you all too as well.\r\n\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.kpao.org/2008/04/where-are-the-web-20-fonts.html\">Originally

    that? To date had one OS maker inquire and I think there are mechanisms in place
    to satisfy them. The ClearType Collection fonts might never be released under
    an open-source license, but more than happy to work with anyone who's interested
    in a license. \r\n"

    Linux UI distros got together to share system font licensing. \r\n\r\nI'm sure
    to do that would involve major political and legal hurdles.\r\n\r\nBut it would
    be nice.\r\n\r\nAlso, 'web 2.0' really doesn't have much to do with fonts, though
    it's certainly an overused/abused term these days."

    relying on people to have fonts pre-installed, it's having fonts linked to Web

    or some modified format such as EOT?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    one?\r\nhttp://www.designbyfire.com/?p=30\r\n\r\nEven if one of the companies
    you mentioned would release some fonts for free, not everyone would download them.
    You would need to bundle them with the operation systems and wait several years
    before everyone runs the new version. \r\n\r\nIt's much more likely that coming
    browser versions will support webfonts and then we don't have to care anymore
    about pre-installed fonts. "

    missed this somehow the first time. But I agree wholeheartedly with Ralf. Further,
    for that to work, the OS vendors have to actually be interested in bundling your
    fonts....\r\n\r\nBut that really doesn't solve the problem faced by Web designers.
    What most of them really want is not just to have a few more good fonts, but to
    be able to use essentially arbitrary fonts - well, actually, the fonts already
    being used in the visual identity for the person/group/organization the site is
    for.\r\n\r\nPlus, as we see more mobile devices used for surfing the Web, you
    get even more vendors in play, and it becomes less practical to bundle gobs of
    fonts with the device/OS.\r\n\r\nWhich brings us back to font embedding/linking.\r\n\r\n(Side
    note: although the Internet may be the engine of Adobe's growth today, IMO it's
    not what made Adobe a \"powerhouse.\")\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
