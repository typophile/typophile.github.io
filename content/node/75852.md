body: "When I start the macro Misc/Do Glyph Alias & Ordering, I get the following
  errors, if the file GlyphOrderAndAliasDB is not in the same directory as the font:\r\n\r\n<cite>Error.
  The path to  SharedData  is not in the sys.path list.\r\nError. Could not find GlyphOrderAndAliasDB
  , even in FDK Shared Data Dir.</cite>\r\n\r\n(The space between 'GlyphOrderAndAliasDB'
  and the comma in the message above is not the reason [but nevertheless it should
  be removed].)\r\n\r\nBut the path to 'FDK\\Tools\\win' is in the PATH variable and
  the file GlyphOrderAndAliasDB is in the directory 'FDK\\Tools\\SharedData'.\r\n\r\nThe
  AFDKO autohint macro works. So it knows about path to 'FDK\\Tools\\win'.\r\n\r\nI
  searched in the files, that belong to the AFDKO, for the error message and I assume(!),
  the bug(?) is located there. But I was not able to make out, how to correct it.\r\n\r\nNot,
  that I actually need the macro 'Do Glyph Alias & Ordering', but since Adobe is going
  to release a new version this year, as far as I am informed, this bug should be
  fixed (if it is a bug).\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAnd the <strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/74826\">problem
  with the stem hist report</a></strong>, that does not seem to work correctly, should
  be likewise fixed. It works with the AFDKO 2.0 26, but not with the actual version.
  At least not correctly."
