    stock, so I\u2019d recommend something along the lines of Skye Uncoated Brilliant
    White, or a similar bright white stock."

  body: Thanks Conor, but when I have my Pantone color book CMYK 70-0-100-0 and PMS
    368U next to each other, the CMYK is a lot darker, it's more like PMS 369U...

    it\u2019s definitely in that region of cyan 67%\u201373%. But like I said before,
    it depends on the paper you choose\u2026 and the quality of the printer."

    isn\u2019t too tight, try getting the printer to work it out for you. They\u2019re
    the ones who know the presses and inks best."
