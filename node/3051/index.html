I am not the one who proffered the <BR>notion of it not being &#39;okay&#39; to post your own logo versions in <BR>another person&#39;s thread. <BR> <BR>If I remember correctly, Joe &#40;Joseph Pemberton&#41; was the first to say something <BR>to the effect of, &#34;Let people do their own work!&#34; <BR> <BR>It made sense, and I took that as an edict. <BR> <BR>In another thread, Stephen lamented about the practice, calling it selfish, if i remember correctly. <BR> <BR>So... <BR> <BR>1. The posting of Joe and Stephen curtails. <BR>2. New typophiles join who don&#39;t know of the edict. <BR>3. Posting work in someone else&#39;s thread becomes the norm. <BR> <BR>I thought it was the right thing to do to speak up ...  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25795.html?1076278621" target="_blank">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25795.html?1076278621</a> <BR> <BR>So if anyone would like to discuss, please feel free. <BR> <BR>My opinion is that the practice is okay if you ask offline. Very simple. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d use this thread as a forum to <BR>voice your opinions ... <BR> <BR>thanks, <BR> <BR>bj</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Being that we are all visual, it is often easier &#40;I&#39;m guilty&#41; to take what someone has posted and manipulate it until it is what we think it should be. However, from a teacher&#39;s point of view, I can also see how this is not the most direct path to learning on the part of the student. That said, I agree with Kris&#39; idea of an icon. That way no one has to ask offline &#40;although this is good&#41; ... and we can all play with one another nicely. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">personaly i don&#39;t see how a visual/graphic critique is any different from a written/verbal one. in any case a critique is just a suggestion which one is free to accept or reject. everyone has opinions and insight to offer, not all you will agree with. making final decisions allows the person whose work is being critiqued to &#34;own&#34; their design &#40;at least that would work for me emotionaly&#41; for example, if someone recommends a certain typeface for a project and someone else says the same face would be a bad idea, i have to come to the final conclusion of whether to use it or not. the final decision is mine, my own. i always appreciate any comments, critique that anyone on here has to offer and take them all with a grain of salt... from what i&#39;ve experienced here we&#39;re all capbable of playing nice and if the person whose work is being critiqued doesn&#39;t want certain types of suggestions, they can always request that they not be made, but then what&#39;s the purpose of the critique?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think there&#39;s more value in manipulating the curve of a letter to match a verbal suggestion, tweaking it until you think it&#39;s right, than simply changing your work to match the sample of someone who suggested an improvement. <BR> <BR>Randy Jones does a great job on his critiques.

		<div class="commentbody">I&#39;ve offered visuals as examples, so I&#39;m &#39;guilty&#39; in this case. Offering professional help means opening yourself up to giving away what you normally get paid for. It may be &#39;bad form&#39; to do it here, but how often do you sketch something for a colleague at your office rather than verbally articulate it because it&#39;s just easier? It&#39;s the difference between a quick sketch &#40;digital or otherwise&#41; and a fully refined &#39;suggestion&#39;. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re visual, so it makes sense that this happens. <BR> <BR>But, I see how it gets out of control sometimes. I agree that an icon/ standard invitation to sketch will probably diffuse the issue.</div>
