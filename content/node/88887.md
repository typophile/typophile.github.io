body: "I have released three fonts, Shuneet, Shuneet Oblique and Shuneet Square\r\nsee
  hebrew-font-shuneet.com.  I am designing seven weights for the font Shuneet and
  would like to match the weights of the other two(Shuneet Oblique and Shuneet Square)
  to them. The weights are light, thin, book, medium, demi-bold, bold and heavy.\r\n\r\nI
  have looked at a number of commercial fonts available in regular and bold and calculated
  their weights according to the Panose scheme:\r\n\r\nCalabri: Medium and Bold.\r\nTahoma:
  Demi-Bold and Heavy\r\nArial: A light Demi-Bold and a dark Bold\r\n\r\nThey are
  all over the place! Calabri is the most recent design so does this represent a current
  accepted practice? When I press the [Bold] button in a word processor can I expect
  a Medium font to become a Bold font (by the Panose definition)?\r\n"

  body: "I'm not sure how relevant/practical Panose is.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are
    trends that change over time*, I don't\r\nthink there is (or even can be) \"current
    accepted practice\".\r\nOne good guideline though is to think in pairs: a light
    and\r\nand a dark with the latter serving as a \"bold\" for the former.\r\nThis
    means that a range of weights isn't necessarily spaced\r\nevenly (I mean not even
    optically).\r\n\r\n* Like the 70s was the age of light fonts\r\nwhile since the
    late 90s we've thankfully\r\nbeen seeing more meat on the bones.\r\n\r\nTahoma's
    Bold is very dark because of screen rendering facilitation.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'Isn''t the key simply making sure there is enough contrast between the regular
    and bold so that the reader sees the bold effortlessly? I know I''ve gone to Light-Bold
    and Regular-Black combinations, but every font is different. '

    Hrant already noted, the fonts you picked were especially engineered for screen
    rendering, while I suspect Panose is still geared towards print."

  body: "I suppose it depends on what you're trying to cover. \r\n\r\nInk on paper
    is one case, but the method of putting the ink on paper matters. Laser and inkjet
    printing take a different weight than offset printing for the running text. Within
    offset printing, the type of paper used can matter as well. If you get right on
    the ragged edge of a particular weight, a type weight might work fine with coated
    or uncoated paper, but not the other. Merlo is an example -- works well with coated
    stock, not so well with uncoated.\r\n\r\nThen there is pixels on screen. Not my
    area of expertise, but I think weighting is different than for ink on paper.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know any way to be sure other than to test. You can make pretty good guesses
    by finding a few types that work well with the desired medium, then extrapolate
    to your fonts.\r\n\r\nOnce you have a \"regular\" and/or a \"book\" -- depending
    on how you sort such things for general text, \"bold\" has to serve it's function.
    Most of use who use type find it helps if there is a semi-bold and a black as
    well, in order to have just the right emphasis for whatever one's doing."

  body: "Thanks for your comments. My font is a Hebrew font with matching Latin.\r\nI
    have used the Latin upper case E as a basis for the Panose weights.\r\nI'm just
    using the Panose scheme to get a suitable range of weights. \r\nThe Hebrew letters
    will be slightly darker and slightly higher than the\r\nLatin lower case. \r\n\r\nThe
    Hebrew is a san-serif design intended for presentation and decorative \r\npurposes.
    \r\n\r\nHowever back to Latin...  The fonts I looked at (Calabri, Tahoma and Arial)\r\nhappen
    to be on my computer.  Could you suggest fonts to examine that are\r\nfor printing?\r\n\r\nMike"
