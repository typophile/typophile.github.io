  some snow bank graffiti this afternoon, gawd my cursive lettering needs work! \r\n\r\nAnd
  no, I didn't drink 10 gallons of blueberry juice to get this done ;) I used a syringe
  dispenser and natural food dye coloring (which I've used many times <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/75039\">before</a>
  and is completely safe and eatable). The lettering is about eight feet wide and
  two feet high.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to do some more ... :)"
