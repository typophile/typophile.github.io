  CS to CS2, and one of the fonts is acting up.\r\nIt's a Bold Roman, and instead
  of setting correctly, it produces garbled glyphs, in Bold Italic.\r\nThe paper's
  production process goes from InDesign via PDF and EPS back to PDF for RIP, or something
  like that.\r\n\r\nI wonder if anyone has come across a similar problem, and knows
  how to fix it?"

    ID numbers? (They shouldn't)\r\nHave they tried restarting the RIP?\r\nDoes the
    text still come out garbled after a RIP restart?\r\n\r\nHave you tried running
    the font family through the AFDKO's CompareFamily?"

  body: "Thanks Miguel.\r\n\r\n1. The garbled glyphs are from the Bold Italic font,
    not the Bold Roman in which the correct glyphs were set.\r\n\r\n2. The fonts are
    OpenType, but as I derived them from older Type 1 fonts, I left the unique Type
    1 ID numbers in the OT font. I hope deleting the ID numbers solves the problem!\r\nNB.
    The fonts do have unique FOND numbers.\r\n\r\n3. I'm pretty sure they have tried
    restarting the RIP.\r\n\r\n5. I've tried to install AFDKO, without success, so
    I don't use it.\r\n\r\n"

    I was kicking myself for not bringing my laptop to TypeCon, when I saw you helping
    Eben with AFDKO on his!"

  body: "I'm happy to report that the issue has been resolved.\r\n\r\nThe problem
    was that my client had made a duplicate of one of the fonts I supplied, with an
    added chevron character.\r\n(That's quite alright within the terms of the contract,
    and made sense to handle in-house initially, and worked well until the software
    update.)\r\nHowever, as the OpenType fonts I provided were customizations of my
    earlier Type 1 retail fonts, I had left the Type 1 ID number in the font info,
    as I didn't know it was unnecessary. At least, it didn't seem to do any harm,
    a redundancy. However when they copied the font, they ended up with two versions
    with the same ID installed, which screwed up somewhere in the production process
    after the CS2 update.\r\n\r\nI made them new versions of the two fonts, with the
    Type 1 ID fields left blank. Now things are working OK, and I ended up looking
    like a star. But I was obliged to tell them that their real saviour was Typophile's
    Build forum, and a certain Adobe representative :-)"

    a font (Normetica) at a buro where i work freelance, \r\nand it stopped working
    around the time we started using a network and CS2.\r\n\r\nIt didn't just stop
    working completely, it was only the weight Normetica A.\r\nNormetica B & C are
    still working. Yesterday i did a test with a collegue, and on a computer that
    is not connected to the network & has CS3 the font is operational.\r\nBut we don't
    have CS3 for all computers yet.\r\n\r\nIf you can tell me where i can find the
    font Type 1 ID, this problem might be solved quicker then i thought.\r\n\r\nthanks
    in advance,\r\nB-A\r\n"
