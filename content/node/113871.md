  body: "Excellent character in the lettering on this sign, presumably Austria, and
    after circa 1910. Don't know of a digital match, or a pre-digital for that matter.\r\nThe
    style shows a mixture of influences, including Art Nouveau and the Arts & Crafts
    movement. Some of the fonts in this link might be of interest.\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/list?3+P22%20Arts%20and%20Crafts%20Tall+0+7G4+1+4PP+7+324+7+5GM+7+45W+7+EBH+7+DIM+7+2WI+7+8I4+7+44Z+7+1ZU+7+40M+7+40L+7+JC+7+A5J+7+3GW+7+6IK+7+6S4+7+6DN+7+NBL+8+7XQ+8+90W+8+CDW+8+359+8+4TS+8+4UJ+8+4UX+8+2EA6+8+4AE+8+OND+8\r\nDon"

  body: "You're welcome Alfred. I should have made a specific mention of Jugendstil,
    which is after all the leading version of the influences of Art Nouveau and Arts
    & Crafts in Austria. So add to your list  David Kerkhoff's new font Himmelblau
    http://www.linotype.com/1247150/Himmelblau-family.html Also designs from Eckmann
    & Behrens are worth a look.\r\nDon\r\n"
