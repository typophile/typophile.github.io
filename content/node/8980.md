body: Hi all, <BR>I&#39;m unable to find a explanation, if there is one, about dcroat
  glyph. Specifically about placement and width of vertical steam. I tried to open
  some existing CE fonts just for refernce and it looks like most of the time it has
  the same width as &#34;uni02C9&#34; &#40;macron&#41; glyph. <BR>Is there any general
  consensus about this. <BR>thanks <BR> <BR> <BR>ps.sorry for bad english

    target="_blank">Microsoft</a>: <BR> <BR>Lowercase d with stroke - dyet <BR>Unicode:
    U&#43;0111 <BR> <BR>Design : This character&#39;s is used in the Croatian, Vietnamese,
    Macedonian and Serbian languages. Its design is based on the lowercase d with
    an added bar. The bar should be the same thickness as other lowercase characters
    with bars. Vertically the bar should be visually centered between the x-height
    and the ascender. It should horizontally extend to the right of the stem similarly
    to the serif in serif designs and enough to be visible at small size but not long
    enough to cause spacing problems for sans serif designs. To the left the bar should
    extend approximately one half the width of the lower bowl of the d and in italic
    designs visually one half the bowl.'
