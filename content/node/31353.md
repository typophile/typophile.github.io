    has been digitized: http://xyz.ch/H.html  and is called \"Lisa\"  apparently...
    although I'm not sure it is for sale. \r\n\r\nRemington Typewriter Italic has
    some similar qualities\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-remington-typewriter/italic/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Elementa Italic</a> which, sadly, has far fewer balls.

    back in the days when one actually had to get a lot of work done with them, they
