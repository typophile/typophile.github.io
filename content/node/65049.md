    those imitation-Chinese Latin fonts you sometimes see at cheap Chinese take-out
    restaurants in the West. \r\n\r\nA more authentic equivalent might be one of those
    Meiji-era fonts."

  body: "Hi Paul,\r\nI know what you mean and I agree with your opinion,\r\nI just
    showed the font has Blackletter like element.\r\nBut I thought it would be nice
    for fancy logos, say, the poster for theater play:-)\r\n\r\nThere several kind
    of Japanese typefaces that were inspired by European typeface styles in Meiji
    and Taisho-era. For example, Japanese cosmetic maker Shiseido has a corporate
    font originated in Taisho era, which has been used for its branding items. It
    seemed that the form of this font came from Socho \uFF08\u5B8B\u671D\u4F53\uFF09style,
    but I feel it has the similar feeling of Blackletters as the end of the strokes
    are very sharp and horizontal strokes are bended like Blackletter's stems. The
    skeleton is very unique but I think it is very beautiful and elegant.\r\n(Quoted
    from Japanese design magazine \"Design Note\".)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shiseido_6139.jpg]\r\n\r\nJapanese
    typeface and Latin typeface are completely different constitution.\r\nI would
    like to know what isokon focus on when he looks for Japanese Blackletter."

    to a non-Latin script with success - see the Hebrew component of Kaas. Highly
    notable.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Greetings Isokon,\r\n\r\nI highly recommend you look into the work of Jun
    Takechi. You can find some examples of his designs in <em>Applied Typography 7</em>
    and <em>Applied Typography 8</em> from the Japan Typography Association, published
    in 1997 and 1998, respectively. There may be more examples in previous or later
    editions, but those books are very expensive and very hard to track down.\r\n\r\nHe
    designs both Japanese and Latin type. Much of his Latin work reminds me of the
    work of Margot Chase or Jonathan Barnbrook."

  body: I remember encountering a .PDF specimen of a Chinese font, offered by a major
    typefounder, that was designed with serifs as if it were a Roman font, but I haven't
    been able to turn it up again by web searches. I am going to continue trying to
    locate it, as it would be relevant to this thread.
