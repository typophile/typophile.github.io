  maybe someone can still recognize the font.

    with the l trimmed.\r\nI recall discussions elsewhere that favored it as a DVD
    subtitle font.\r\nDon"

  body: "Well, I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. I sent an email to Criterion
    asking about the font and here\u2019s the response:\r\n<blockquote>Thanks for
    your email and interest! Criterion uses Arial Bold for subtitles, and also a proprietary
    font used by one of the subtitle houses we work with that closely resembles Arial.
    I hope this helps! Please feel free to write again if you have any other questions.</blockquote>"
