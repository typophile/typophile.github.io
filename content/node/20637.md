      Right arrows with Command do 100pt jumps  horizontally while Up and Down arrows
      switch to the next/prev node (FLS 5.02/Mac).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"

  body: The problem is that you're using FontLab 4 and everyone else here is using
    FontLab Studio 5. As far as I know, you can't change that setting in FontLab 4.

  body: It works okay on my Mac (5.0.2). Maybe you changed the default settings inadvertently
    or something?

  body: "Mark,\r\nYes, it works if you apdated from 5.0.1. But if you install 5.0.2
    from scratch (or remove prefs and workspaces) Cmd-Up and Cmd-Down will switch
    to the next/prev node.\r\nIt's my fault :(\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"
