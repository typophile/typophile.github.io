    usually know where i want to go and why (much better preview option. in this case\u2026).\r\nFor
    me it always worked to just enter the FS.com-url again after having been redirected
    to FS.de, hit enter, done.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, i find it truly annoying too, the internet
    is an open, international kind of thing and websites that redirect me elsewhere
    simply because of my IP-address or browser language are somewhat out of order
    in terms of usability, compliance with user expectations, etc. Plus it just doesn't
    fit in the general picture i have of FS as a very helpful, customer oriented company.\r\n\r\nI
    truly hope FS will do something about that, soon."

    can't. In HTML there is no other use of a double-click, than bypassing a FontShop

    know enough about FontShops redirect mechanism to tell you why this works. Maybe
    it's just a bug and the redirect doesn't work if you fire multiple calls to the
    website, or maybe they included this trick on purpose as a backdoor, so the guys
    in Berlin can look at their international sites once in a while ...\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n"

  body: The FSI network is organized so that local FontShops can serve (and sell to)
    their own region. This comes with some drawbacks, but mostly positives. Where
    there is a local FontShop, marketing materials and support services are appropriate
    to each region's needs and language. Tangible goods cost less to ship. Events,
    like <a href="http://www.typoberlin.de">TYPO Berlin</a>, strengthen and engage
    the local design community.

    directly in oversight of web development projects there, I can attest to the fact
    that trying to find out what fonts users have installed on their hard drives was
    never on the extremely long dev wishlist. The good people at FontShop have more
    important things to think about, like how to market typefaces, service customers,
    and take care of designers who choose to work with them.\r\n\r\nCookies are a
    fact of internet life, and not typically intended for nefarious purposes (at least
    when browsing the online shops of reputable companies).\r\n\r\nWith regard to
    the issue of being directed to your home country/region's website for font purchases,
    the folks at FontShop have struggled with that and are really trying to build
    a good user experience while adhering to contractual agreements with the various
    local FontShops. The global market is not always as easy to implement as we would
    like, but rest assured, these people really *are* trying.\r\n\r\n"
