body: "From two blogs\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/27984\r\nfeed://www.typophile.com/crss/node/27984\r\n\r\nI
  learned that there is double mapping for Delta, Omega, mu; according to \u201CAGLFN
  1.6 (new) strict\u201D Unicode-Name mapping table:\r\n\r\nU+2206 \u201Cuni2206\u201D
  - (for the INCREMENT)\r\nU+0394 \u201CDelta\u201D      - (for Greek Delta)\r\n---------------\r\n\LU+00B5
  \u201Cuni00B5\u201D - (for MICRO SIGN)\r\nU+03BC \u201Cmu\u201D        - (for Greek
  Mu)\r\n----------------\r\nU+2126 \u201Cuni2126\u201D - (for OHM SIGN)\r\nU+03A9
  \u201COmega\u201D   - (for Greek Omega)\r\n\r\nI have to transform an old postscript
  font (that was used for some phonetics) into an opentype font so that a large amount
  of text that was created in the postscript font (in various Mac-programs) can be
  used with opentype font both on Mac and PC. (At the same time I need to make sure
  that we still can use the old postscript font - or an appropriate updated new postscript
  font - because we need it for creation of \"printing standard\"-Acrobat4-pdfs that
  are accepted by printing companies.)\r\n\r\nIf I use Glyph names \"Delta\" and \"mu\",
  all is fine with these letters.\r\n\r\nHowever, for Omega neither the name \u201COmega\u201D
  nor the name \u201Cuni2126\u201D produces satisfactory results. In InDesign (Mac)
  it is basically OK, but in TextEdit and some other programmes on MacIntosh the phonetic
  letter does not show up, but rather the letter is transformed into Lucida Grande
  (Standard Font) and appears as an Omega in this Lucida Grande Font.\r\n\r\nIf I
  name the Glyph \u201Cuni03A9\u201D, which is not according to \u201CAGLFN 1.6 (new)
  strict\u201D, then all works out fine on the MacIntosh.\r\nI wonder why this is
  so and if this choice could create problems in the future - or on the PC. (I am
  using MacBookPro OSX.4.10)\r\nI should add that I use the \"MacOS Roman\" encoding
  table in Fontlab.\r\n\r\nPart II:\r\nAlso I would be happy if you could also suggest
  what is better:\r\n\r\n1) Double encoding\r\nName: \"Delta\";      Unicode: 0394
  + 2206\r\nName: \"mu\";         Unicode: 03BC + 00B5\r\nName: \u201Cuni03A9\u201D;
  Unicode: 2126 + 03A9\r\n\r\nor simple encoding for first two Glyphs\r\n2)\r\nName:
  \"Delta\";      Unicode: 0394\r\nName: \"mu\";         Unicode: 03BC\r\nName: \u201Cuni03A9\u201D;
  Unicode: 2126 + 03A9\r\n\r\nor\r\n3)\r\nName: \"Delta\";      Unicode: 0394\r\nName:
  \"mu\";         Unicode: 03BC\r\nName: \u201Cuni03A9\u201D; Unicode: 03A9\r\n\r\nor\r\n4)\r\nName:
  \"Delta\";      Unicode: 0394\r\nName: \"mu\";         Unicode: 03BC\r\nName: \u201Cuni03A9\u201D;
  Unicode: 2126\r\n\r\nThe fourth possibility, which is unusual, I consider because
  it seems to me that Adobe Programmes prefer Unicode 2126.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for any advice\r\nVolker\r\n\r\n"

  body: "this would have been better filed under the \"Build\" section.\r\n\r\nI was
    hoping that someone like Adam or Miguel or John would have piped up before me,
    but i'm guessing they're all busy with ATypI at the moment. Anyway, I recently
    dealt with this problem and found that To get things to work properly I had to
    give the letter names (Delta, Omega, mu) to the math glyphs and uni-names to the
    Greek letter glyphs. However, I was alerted that giving uni-names to other Greek
    letter glyphs (such as Alphatonos) will produce problems in Mac applications."

  body: "Thank you very much for the advice. You are right, I should have put it in
    \"Build\", somehow it took me days to find where I actually put it (I was also
    a few days out of office).\r\n\r\nI profited a lot from the your thread \"Apple
    and CFF: what's the deal?\" http://www.typophile.com/node/37122 that you started
    a few minutes after you answered my question. It seems its best to hope that apple
    solves the issue with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat a surprise
    <cite>\"that to get things to work properly\"</cite> you <cite>\"had to give the
    letter names (Delta, Omega, mu) to the math glyphs and uni-names to the Greek
    letter glyphs\"</cite>. From \u201CAGLFN 1.6 (new) strict\u201D Unicode-Name mapping
    table:\r\n\r\nU+2206 \u201Cuni2206\u201D - (for the INCREMENT)\r\nU+0394 \u201CDelta\u201D
    \     - (for Greek Delta)\r\n---------------\r\n\LU+00B5 \u201Cuni00B5\u201D -
    (for MICRO SIGN)\r\nU+03BC \u201Cmu\u201D        - (for Greek Mu)\r\n----------------\r\nU+2126
    \u201Cuni2126\u201D - (for OHM SIGN)\r\nU+03A9 \u201COmega\u201D   - (for Greek
    Omega)\r\n\r\none would expect it just the other way . But it was also my experience
    with the \"Omega\", although \"Delta\" and \"mu\" seemed kind of OK also the other
    way.\r\n\r\nVolker"

  body: "I am sorry to be such an amateur at this but I am just getting into typesetting
    in InDesign while using polytonic Greeks fonts. I am now familiar with a few of
    the letters. I went to type a \"smooth breathing\" mark for a capital letter.
    In glyph it says that it's corresponding letter is 'increment'. Where is that
    found? So I surfed google. I came across this site. And now I read of all these
    other discrepancies: omega, and mu. Would someone help me with my beginning in
    understanding this all. Or steer me the right direction.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nYanni"

    version of the AGLFN, 1.7.

  body: "Thanks,\r\n\r\nI was having the same problem with several faces I am adding
    a Greek weight too. It drove me crazy trying to figure out what was happening.
    I thought I had some weird coding fragment so I imported several of them into
    a new file, but it didn't work. Paul's solution worked flawlessly.\r\n\r\nIt does
    seem strange to me that the Greek alphabet wouldn't get claim to the glyph names
    and not the other way around."
