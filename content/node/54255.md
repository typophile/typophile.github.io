  but a lot of people don't realize that it is hard to get something random to look
  good because the artist knows exactly what pieces he wants where.  This piece is
  by Raoul Hausmann and is called ABCD. Dadaists used a lot of collages mixed with
  nonsense type. I think its a design principle that we can use today.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/piet-mondrian-tableau-2_5995.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  chose this De Stijl piece by Piet Mondrian because I love using grids. I think it
  is a really important design skill to have when you can have next to nothing on
  the page but it makes an impact. Clean simple design is very different from dada,
  but I like to be inspried by all kinds of design.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bauhaus_5254.jpg]\r\n\r\nLastly,
  I chose the Bauhaus. This is a poster by Joost Schmidt for the Bauhaus. It has elements
  of constructivism (another period I enjoy) and De Stijl. I love the slanted grid
  and the unity of the whole piece. "
