  body: "Renko is correct. We used Friz Quadrata for the exhibition's graphic identity.
    The exhibition graphic design should be up here soon with all proper credits:
    http://momadesignstudio.org/. \r\n\r\nSteve, extra points for you this semester
    for taking the initiative to ask (though you could've just asked me in class!).\r\n\r\n"
