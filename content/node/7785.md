  body: I'm sure it's not correct, but I was able to reproduce it perfectly with Futura
    Bold Condensed, with 75% vertical scale.

  body: Fabulous is BrushScript. With an alternate F, though... Maybe from another
    font? <BR>I&#39;m pretty sure about abolous being BrushScript. <BR>&#40;Does this
    count as a full ID, Yves?&#41;

  body: It might help with the Idenification if you could tell the type experts about
    when the sign was created. Type and eras go together

  body: 'Yves, I don&#39;t think Frutiger and/or Helvetica match... Considering the
    dating Frutiger is out of the question, of course. My guess is, one should look
    into transfer lettering of the time.  <BR> <BR>BTW: The stretching remark I made
    doesn&#39;t make sense in this respect, either. Probably the &#34;original&#34;
    BrushScript is a bit wider than the one that&#39;s digitally available -- or the
    illustration has been stretched a bit.'

  body: Bert, I don&#39;t think this is a photo of the sign -- looks like a digital
    recreation. So the dates of the fonts needn&#39;t match, since whoever digitized
    it may have used what was at hand, rather than what was historically accurate.
