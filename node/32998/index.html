<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Mark Simonson is staying in my home town and I am meeting him tonight. Belgian Typophiles who are in the neighborhood are invited to join us if they feel like it. Just contact me through my profile before 7 pm.
Also, Stephen asked me to say hello for him. Anyone else wants to pass him a message? :^)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm just curious about the show-up... I was hesitating myself to take the train to Gent, but I don't think I would've had anything interesting to say (I'm just an amateur & everything I know about typography is what I read in these forums).
Did you spend all night talking about kerning, serifs, hyphens etc.? ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi all...
Tiffany--I got all your emails. That was just my automatic "vacation" message you were getting.
Gent was wonderful and Yves is very lucky to live there. He gave us a great evening walking tour of the downtown area. I don't think we actually talked about type very much. I tried to stump him by getting him to identify a somewhat obscure font on a sign (fat chance), but that was about it. Mostly we talked about Gent and differences between living there and the U.S., the design business and stuff.
Oh, and I finally got that beer he promised me three years ago. :-)

Earlier in the day, before we met up with Yves, we visited the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp and got to see some of the few remaining Garamond punches:

I'll try to post some stuff about the museum this week on my blog.
Thanks again, Yves, for the tour and everything.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Copyright is one of my favourite stores, but to ne honest, I like the one in Antwerp better. It has very clean originazed sections & anybody who's interested in typography or graphic design just has to walk in & take the stairs to your right (for architecture take the left stairs). The one on Gent seems a little bit more "eclectic" which is in contrast to its concept. OK, so I have to admit, I lived in Antwerp for a couple of years & I when I go to the Copyright in Gent I rarely get passed the right corner ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I went to Copyright (in Antwerp) today & bought "Indie Fonts 3" & "The Best Of 1-Color + 2-Color Graphics". Those 2 purchases filled up my customer card (with a discount of 47,something Euros on my next purchase). I went straight back to my section & took "Made With FontFont" home as well :-)))
I really shouldn't be buying books anymore, my bookcase is completely filled, but I really couldn't resist. Copyright has this magnetic field around it that attracts me from miles away.
Completely off the subject, but I also bought a pluche Hamburger from Friends With You (I've had my eye on that one for a long time, but never found it so far).
Yves, do you know CityKingz in Gent? They also have great graphic books (if you're interested in other things than typography that is)?</div>
