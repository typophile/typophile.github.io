body: I have a one glyph with long list of exception kerning values and another glyph
  that is a key glyph in my class kerning setup. I'd like to copy all glyph's (exception)
  kerning values to that key glyph. Multiple weights with this same problem, so there's
  quite a bit of work to do manually. Any ideas? Maybe Python scripts, texteditors
  or even Excel could do some find/replace magic?

  body: Copy left/right kerning is one of FontLab's 'Paste Special' functions. It
    isn't 100% reliable, and the results need to be checked carefully, but should
    work in the situation you describe. In Windows FontLab, select the first glyph,
    Ctrl+C, select the second glyph, Alt+Ctrl+V opens the Paste Special dialogue.
