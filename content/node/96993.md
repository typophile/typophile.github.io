  found this one: http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509/\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know it? Is it worth the price?"

    occasionally, nice to thumb through and get ideas.

    Was I mistaken?

  body: "@sendoushi\r\n\r\nHrant's recommendation, IMHO, should be a first read although
    I would put the Tracy book at the top of the list. Then go for the designing part.\r\n\r\nAnother
    source for the book at varying prices would be:\r\nhttp://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?isbn=0300111509&sts=t"

  body: "I picked the Cheng book up early this year, when I decided it was time to
    try moving from casual playing around in TypeTool to proper typeface design.  For
    a rank amateur wanting to learn how things actually work, IMO it's fantastic --
    simple, easy to read and understand, and full of vital information.  It's probably
    a useful reference even for more experienced designers.  It only specifically
    deals with serif and sans-serif roman letters (no italic, cursive, blackletter,
    non-Latin languages, etc.) but many of the principles shown seem pretty generally
    applicable.\r\n\r\nI'm definitely going to pick up Bringhurst when I can, but
    I heard there's a new edition coming out in a few months so I'm waiting for that.
    \ I'll add Lawson and Tracy to my list as well... unfortunately, it looks as though
    the Tracy book is out of print and impossible to find (except in the exhorbitantly
    expensive rare used books category)."

    \ You're not going to get any more practical use out of a type design book than
    Cheng's.\r\nThe Elements of Typographic Style is really more about setting type.\r\nAnatomy
    of a Typeface is a book of personal opinions about faces that have already been
    designed.  Letters of Credit is quite good though."

    typesetting, historic type style evolution and practical study of great designs
    is a solid basis for doing worthy type design.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you may wind up
    spendig huge amounts of time inventing boiled water."
