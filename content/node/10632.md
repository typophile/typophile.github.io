  marketing materials. Questions is: Do we buy the fonts being used in the design
  for the designer or does the designer have to provide the fonts for us? &#40;The
  designer will be working off site&#41; <BR> <BR>If we already own this font can
  we &#34;give&#34; it to the designer for use on the work he/she will be doing for
  us?  <BR> <BR>Is there any legal information on the web I can reference about this?
  <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help! <BR> <BR>kb'

  body: Most typical font licenses are for use on a limited number of devices at a
    single site. Offsite freelancers &#40;or company employees working at home&#41;
    would need to have their own license to use the fonts, unless an extended license
    is negotiated with the foundry in advance. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s between you and the
    freelancer as to who pays for the fonts, of course. If they&#39;re specified for
    a particular project, it&#39;s nice if the hiring company pays the freight on
    typefaces. <BR> <BR>An easy way to manage this is to have the freelancer purchase
    the fonts themselves, so that they will be listed as a legitimate licensee in
    the foundry&#39;s records. This is also really helpful if the freelancer needs
    tech support on the fonts. <BR> <BR>The freelancer can add the cost of the fonts
    into the job as an expense, and when you pay the final bill, you pay for the license
    for the fonts required for your project&#40;s&#41;. If you negotiate to make the
    freelancer pay for the fonts, he/she will have to purchase their own license from
    the foundry anyway. <BR> <BR>The terms of the End User License Agreement &#40;EULA&#41;
    from each foundry vary, so review them carefully, or ask the foundry itself, if
    you&#39;re not sure about the rules. <BR> <BR>I am sure you will get some really
    great answers from more people here on Typophile, and it will happen soon! <BR>

  body: If the freelancer is a part time or full time employee, the fonts should be
    licensed to the agency and your freelancer may use them for your agency project.
    <BR> <BR>If your freelancer is nothing more than a work for hire person &#40;1099er&#41;,
    they must be the license holder of the font however they legally can&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t
    give the fonts to you with their files due to the license they hold as the owner.
    <BR> <BR>If you wish to alter the work after it has been completed, you should
    purchase the fonts in the name of the agency or have the freelancer &#40;aka license
    holder&#41; go back and do the work. Most licenses aren&#39;t transferrable without
    some sort of agreement with the foundry. <BR> <BR>Beyond that, the only other
    stipulation MOST EULAs have is for service bureaus. Most licenses contain a passage
    to the effect of you may give the fonts to a service bureau to output and produce
    the job, but they must delete the fonts from their CPU once the job is completed
    and they may not archive a copy of the font. <BR> <BR>I hope my explaination doesn&#39;t
    sound dogmatic but in practice, this would be the &#34;proper&#34; way to do this
    sort of thing since you asked. . . <BR> <BR>Stuart :D

  body: The AIGA published a paper called <i>Use of Fonts</i> as part of their Business
    and Ethics series. I don&#39;t recall if it covers this specific issue, but you

    ship it off to a client to do as they please with it, is that legitimate?

  body: This goes both ways. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t count how many times clients have
    asked us to send  <BR>them the fonts after we&#39;ve created a piece that they
    will need  <BR>to maintain or update internally. Our standard answer  <BR>is simply
    that we can&#39;t legally do that. Sure they may think  <BR>we&#39;re stiffs,
    but they also realize that we&#39;re just protecting  <BR>ourselves, and not trying
    to be jerks.

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve generally found that the larger the client is the better they
    understand the need to ensure that all their software, including fonts, is legitimately
    licensed.'
