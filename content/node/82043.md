body: "Someone was asking recently about designs/logos made of stripes where the design
  was picked out by changes in the stripe thickness. I have in mind a similar, but
  different effect:\r\n\r\nI've seen designs where the image appears, at first glance
  (especially when you look at it quite close up) to be <em>just</em> lines, usually
  diagonal. But then, if you look at it from a little further away, or move your head
  and the page relative to each other, you see text or a graphic element, subtly hidden.
  It's not a change in the <em>direction</em> of the lines, nor an immediately noticeable
  change in the line thickness (unline the previous person's question).\r\n\r\n(a)
  do you know what I'm talking about?\r\n(b) if so, has this thing got a name?\r\n(c)
  how's it done?\r\n\r\nCheers"

    is done by slightly altering the thickness or size of the elements (lines/dots)."

    line thickness, then: merely more subtle than in the other guy's query!\r\n\r\nI
    bet somebody somewhere's given it a name though!"

  body: Yeah, that's the "other" recent thread I was referring to. Of course, in those,
    there's no optical "trickery" since the line width changes are strong enough to
    be obvious without having to take your specs off or wiggle your head about! :^)

  body: "LOL ... :^)\r\n\r\nSeriously though: I've now got the answer: some of your
    replies suddenly reminded me of the 'spatial frequency' effect, as described in
    a <em>Scientific American</em> article ([[http://www.nature.com/scientificamericanmind/journal/v20/n6/full/scientificamericanmind1109-22.html|here]]).\r\n\r\nDoing
    a Google image search on \"spatial frequency\" brought up [[http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22spatial+frequency%22+text&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi&biw=1366&bih=544|results]]
    including those very same images that Wouter linked to above: [[http://teqnoqolor.com/articles/the-spatial-frequency-illusion/|thus]].\r\n\r\nI
    just never made the link between these two types of images...\r\n"
