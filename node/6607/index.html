  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">i can&#39;t remember where now, but i saw a font the other day that had the same width for several different weights of a font. i&#39;m wondering when is this useful? is this adviseable under &#34;normal&#34; conditions?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I call that &#34;uniwidth&#34;. One of the MRF fonts &#40;Delicato?&#41; does this. Another example is the graded fonts at Font Bureau &#40;although that&#39;s meant for compensating for gain, not for marking visible weight differences&#41;. And then there&#39;s the Hoefler display font series - Proteus Project. But probably the most prominent example is the Compatil system by Linotype - an amazing effort. BTW, my own Patria does it too, but only for the Regular and Demi weights, not the Light and Bold. <BR> <BR>I think it is -or at least can be- highly useful. The only problem is that beyond a certain weight range you have to start sacrificing the width/narrowness appearance of the whole to maintain the widths: the lights start looking wide and the darks narrow. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">so is this kind of thing fairly common then? is using this kind of uniwidth spacing scheme viable from a roman weight to a bold weight? or is the scope more limited? i&#39;m sure it depends on the design... i would think this kind of uniwidth scheme would work better for a sans than for a serif, or does it matter? What elements of design would allow this kind of spacing to work? what design elements would keep it from working? is there any literature on such models that i should be reading? i&#39;d like to know these things!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">originaly i wondered how useful such a scheme would be. it seemed to me that this kind of thing would compromise either the design of the bold weight or the spacing of the lighter weight. but maybe one could strike a happy balance? I&#39;m trying to think what are some instances one would be so concerned about spacing as to make this kind of spacing scheme desireable? sure it might be nifty, but is it really necessary in any particular instances?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It&#39;s very rarely &#34;necessary.&#34; <BR> <BR>In a normal monospaced design, of course, one would expect the bold face to be the same width as the regular. <BR> <BR>I seem to recall old typesetting systems that duplexed the italic with the upright, so that the italic had to be the same widths.

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; I&#39;d wonder why do it at all. <BR> <BR>Well, for one thing, if you derive multiple weights from a single source weight, you can just leave the widths alone &#40;as long as you derive accordingly&#41;. So in a way not changing the weights is easier! Coupled with the fact that uniwidth <i>can</i> be useful sometimes &#40;like if you prefer to mark emphasis through weight change instead of italics&#42;, and would like to maintain linebreaks&#42;&#42;&#41; it makes sense - as long as you realize that there&#39;s a threshold beyond which the compromise to the integrity of the design &#40;in terms of its characteristic width/narrowness&#41; is too much. That&#39;s why Trinite &#40;and Patria&#41; only apply it to the Regular and Medium/Demi weights. <BR> <BR>&#42; Like in TYPO magazine. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; Another place uniwidth is relevant is animation. <BR> <BR>BTW, Raph, there was once an interesting Typophile discussion about Sabon&#39;s constraints. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
