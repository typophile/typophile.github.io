body: "I\u2019m preparing some fonts for web use, and I wonder if anyone can shed
  some light on the current browser support for Postscript based WOFF files, and how
  one should ideally set up the CSS.\r\n\r\nI have until now done the following:\r\n\r\n<code>@font-face
  {\r\n    font-family: 'MyWebfont';\r\n    src: url('webfont.eot');\r\n    src: url('webfont.eot?#iefix')
  format('embedded-opentype'),\r\n         url('webfont.woff') format('woff'),\r\n
  \        url('webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),\r\n         url('webfont.svg#MyWebFont')
  format('svg');\r\n    font-weight: normal;\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n\r\n}</code>\r\n\r\nThe
  WOFF is the only Postscript based font in the stack. Unfortunately this doesn\u2019t
  seem to work in Chrome on Windows. \r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong?"

  body: Another thing. How does this downloading work in the browser? Will it look
    for the first font, and if that is not present move on to the next? Or will it
    download all of them?

  body: "Because, as far as I know, the only up-to-date browser that does not support
    WOFF is Internet Explorer, and it needs EOT files. TTF is fallback for older browsers
    (Fontsquirrel provides a layer of security with its Web-only setting, and I don\u2019t
    know any similar solution for OTF files), and SVG is for older mobile browsers.
    \r\n\r\nHow would you set it up?"

  body: If you wonder why I want to serve Postscript based fonts, it is because they
    force Windows to use the Standard GDI rendering. If you wonder why I want to do
    that, take a look at any headline sized font rendered with Cleartype GDI!

    is NOT rendering the WOFF, have you figured out which font file Chrome IS rendering?\r\nAccording
    the spec, Chrome should be rendering the first format it finds that it supports
    - in this case WOFF. But you say it isn't doing that so I'm intrigued.\r\nFirst,
    how do you know for sure that it's skipping the WOFF? And what's the test environment
    or environments?  (Diagnosing stuff like this isn't simple.) Chrome version what,
    running on what?\r\nAnd if Chrome is not rendering the WOFF, is it rendering the
    TTF or is it rendering the SVG?\r\n\r\nI am assuming you think it's the TTF, because
    the SVG would render the font similarly to the OTF, I would imagine. (I stopped
    bothering with SVG fonts a long time ago so I haven't seen any to compare lately.)\r\n\r\nIf
    you're stumped, I'll test the files independently for you. Let me know.\r\n\r\nRich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    that. Don't go blind over hacks! Postscript has to be the future if you want a
    detail rich, Opentype savvy web. Truetype is too bloated in file size for large
    character sets and organic lettershapes. And off course it matters if the font
    looks scratchy! If you don't think so, you're surely come to the wrong corner
    of the web. And btw: There is such a thing as a \"headline sized font\". It\u2019s
    fracking BIG.\r\n\r\nBut, to pull us back on topic (sort of), I'm still looking
    for answers to my two other questions: \r\nHow does the downloading of font files
    work in web browser -- do they pull all or only one file? And how should one ideally
    set up the CSS for Postscript-based webfonts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: ">There is such a thing as a \"headline sized font\". It\u2019s fracking BIG.\r\n\r\nIn
    web design, you don't get to decide what's fracking BIG. The bigness and smallness
    of type is not under your control.  This is difficult to accept, I understand.\r\n\r\nYou
    can fight against this lack of control using elaborate server-side user agent
    \"sniffing\" if that is available to you.\r\nFor example, if you detect that the
    user agent is Safari running on an iPad, you will know the physical size of the
    viewport and you can \"feed\" a set of default sizes accordingly.\r\nBut those
    settings are only a starting point. Your \"design\" is a recommendation that may
    have very, very limited influence.\r\n\r\nIn web design, you've got a lot of partners.
    The user is one of them. And the user can effortlessly enlarge or reduce your
    carefully chosen \"sizes\" to suit their tastes. \r\n\r\nUsing CSS and HTML alone,
    the idea of being able to specify big type or small type has become so vague and
    unpredictable if not totally meaningless, it's counterproductive. \r\nIf you can't
    predict (or detect) the size of the viewport, you can't control the size of the
    type. And even if you do predict (or detect) the size of the viewport, your decision
    is easily overriden.\r\n\r\nSo, good luck with setting the \"size\" of your web
    fonts. \r\n\r\nBTW - I don't understand what you mean by \"going blind over hacks\".\r\n"

    \ There's no right or wrong here.\r\nIt's more of a perceptual thing. Understanding
    and accepting are two different things.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, until the rise
    of small screens on smart phones and tablets, web design wasn't regarded as all
    that different from print design. It was print design that accomodated a few different
    paper sizes and made some allowances for low res. \r\nToday, there are way too
    many canvas sizes for that thinking to continue.\r\n\r\nThis is interesting:\r\n<em>For
    example, if you want a certain piece of text to end up very large, make it a large
    number of steps away from the smallest that has to be read: in the process of
    making the critical text large enough the user can't avoiding making the biggest
    size very large.</em>\r\n\r\nI don't think anyone's yet done decent research on
    size ranges. What the limits are. How big should text within an h1 tag be in relation
    to the text in the p tag, that kind of thing. And if the user goes large on the
    body text, will the h1 text become useless because you are only seeing a fragment
    of it?\r\nThat kind of thing.  \r\n\r\nLater....."
