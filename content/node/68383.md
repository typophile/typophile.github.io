  cover has two faces - a sans and a serif\r\n\r\n\r\nand the inside title pages uses
  a(or a couple of)  sans serif(s) in several weights, does anyone know what they
  are?\r\n\r\n\r\n  "

  body: "The Sans on the cover seems to have a short middle arm on the E, so I suggest
    something like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/engravers-gothic/|Engravers
    Gothic]] or maybe Interstate widened.\r\n\r\nThe Sans inside the book is not the
    same, and might be Helvetica, as Ryuk suggested.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I'm also not convinced that Garamond is the right serif for the cover, although
    it's hard to see the detail well enough. The M seems more splayed looking, and
    I thought [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/janson-text/|Janson]] might be
    closer. Also because the 'k' upper arm seems so much lighter in your sample.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can get a closer view that would help a lot.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I wish I could say that helped, and I guess it did in a way, but it hasn't
    pointed to an answer yet. That 'k' is quite unusual. The 'a' does look like Janson
    to me, but nothing else matches very well. The M looks more like Romana than anything
    else, but the rest of the lower case isn't Romana. \r\n\r\nCan you tell that I'm
    stumped? I would really like to know what this is now.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The closest I can seem to manage is a customization/distortion of De Vinne.
    This image (below) is admittedly crude because it was made by distorting a test
    drive image, but I think it shows the possibility that a typeface like this could
    have been artificially condensed/manipulated to produce something similar. This
    De Vinne was the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/de-vinne/|one
    from Wooden Type Fonts]].\r\n\r\nPerhaps the initials were not distorted as much,
    but if you look at the basic font, I see a strong resemblance to the typeface
    used for the book cover. Am I imagining things?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HarukiMurakamiDeVinneSim_5904.gif]"
