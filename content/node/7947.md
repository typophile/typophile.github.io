body: Are there any articles or books that I can read about doing layouts for magazine
  ads and the like?  While my initial attempts don&#39;t look too bad, I could use
  some help and some principles to follow.  I&#39;ve read some books on scientific
  advertising and think I got a grip of the conceptual side of things, but typography
  and layout are still giving me some trouble.  I&#39;m not an advertiser at all;
  just trying to make some decent ads where I can &#34;fake it&#34; until I have some
  money to get it done by somebody who actually knows how.  heh

  body: Ogilvy is one of the Godfather&#39;s of advertising. Perhaps advertising is
    looked down upon, but I find clever &#40;ergo well-created&#41; advertising to
    be better than anything in the realm of visual design. Hmm. Well, maybe not better,
    but I do appreciate it. Does his book have a bibliography? If yes, I&#39;d dig
    through that.  <BR> <BR>Generally, anything published by Phaidon is good and informational.  <BR>
    <BR>Creative Advertising doesn&#39;t look bad. <BR> <BR>I would suggest you study
    well-written copy in the book above &#40;for instance&#41; and read what Ogilvy
    says &#40;for instance&#41;, before buying that copy-writing book. Although <a

    might has something useful to say and maybe Marty Neumeier too. Al Ries, Jack
    Trout. Tibor Kalman. Not really ADMEN, but great writers. <BR> <BR>If you can
    get your hands on a copy of Ogilvy&#39;s &#34;Confessions of an Advertising Man&#34;
    or &#34;Blood, brains, and beer&#34; .. those are both quite entertaining and
    not so bad on the informational side either. <BR>  <BR>Although, some might say,
    great advertising is really just a culmination of the stars--design, brand, understanding
    the market, writing. I&#39;m sure someone will post and steer you somewhere else.

  body: The cover of The Copywriter&#39;s Handbook is enough to scare away anyone
    with a lick of visual sense. But I&#39;ve read the book, and it&#39;s actually
    quite good -- lots of practical examples. <BR> <BR>Read Ogilvy for the Big Idea
    approach. Read The Copywriter&#39;s Handbook to learn how to turn the Big Idea
    into succinct copy.
