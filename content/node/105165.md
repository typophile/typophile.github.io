body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nI just want to mix two different fonts, but Fontforge has always
  stopped working. And I cannot use eudcedit, because I want vectorgraphics. So what
  program is for free and is also easy to use with windows. I don't want to create
  new letters, I just want to mix them.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot and sorry for my bad english"
