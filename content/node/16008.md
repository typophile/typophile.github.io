  body: "oops... well, first of all my deepest apologies if in any case you felt uncomfortable
    finding out that someone is using your name as icon.\r\n\r\nThe character itself
    is extremely interesting and beautiful in its simplicity, but I did choose it
    because of the importance the cinnabar had in chinese alchemy.\r\n\r\nNo, actually
    I just wanted an obscure cool icon that no one would understand. Now it's spoiled
    and I'll have to change it."

  body: "No, you shouldn't change it. I don't feel uncomfortable at all, and I find
    it pretty neat that out of all the character that you could use for an 'obscure
    cool icon' you chose my name. It just made me do a double-take when I saw it.
    \r\n\r\nAnd I agree that the charaacter is beautiful (if I can say that about
    my own name). When I was little, I used to write it as \u4E39\u4E39, and imagined
    it as two people holding hands. Yes, I was already kind of nuts at a young age.\r\n\r\nCinnabon,
    mmmm, carbs..."
