  body: There are two very good essays, one about Arabic and one about Hebrew, in
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1932026010/qid=1074703376//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/103-4402685-6125406?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"><i>Language
    Culture Type</i></a>. <BR> <BR>One of the best books I have on Arabic calligraphy
    is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0197276040/qid=1074703432//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i11_xgl14/103-4402685-6125406?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"><i>The
    art of the pen</i></a>, which not only shows a lot of wonderful stuff but also
    explains what you are looking at. The section at the back showing examples of
    the major calligraphic styles may be particularly useful for you.

  body: I&#39;ve never seen <i>The Art of the Pen</i>. I&#39;ll take Mr. Hudson&#39;s
    word for it, but it seems rather steeply priced at the moment. I have a copy of
    Abdelkebir Khatibi and Mohammed Sijelmassi&#39;s <i>The Splendor of Islamic Calligraphy</i>,
    published by Thames and Hudson, which provides a decent catalog of styles. It
    was republished recently and is now far more affordable than the copy I got soaked
    by in Istanbul some years back.

  body: Another very good book is TF Mitchell&#39;s <i> Writing Arabic</i>. This book
    focuses almost exclusively on the <i>ruq&#39;ah</i> script, the most common daily
    handwriting style found in the Middle East, but it is the only text I&#39;ve come
    across, apart from Thomas Milo&#39;s essay in <i>Language Culture Type</i>, that
    treats connectivity of the Arabic script as something other than collections of
    &#39;ligatures&#39;. <BR> <BR>John B&#39;s recommendation of <i>The splendor of
    Islamic calligraphy</i> is a good one, which I&#39;ll second. Its catalogue of
    styles is not as complete nor as nuanced as that in <i>The art of the pen</i>,
    i.e. it misses a number of significant sub-styles, but it has many good examples
    of fine work. Perhaps a academic library near you has a copy of <i>The art of
    the pen?</i>

  body: Thnx everyone for your reactions. I already ordered a copy of &#34;Arabic
    script&#34; by Gabriel Mandel Khan last week on amazon and expecting it any moment,
    I also orded his book on Hebrew script, though this book exists only in Italian
    and my Italian is not that good. Has anybody any suggestions on books on Hebrew
    script &#40;in English&#41; ??

  body: For Hebrew, it just so happens that I just got <a href="http://oakknoll.com/detail.php?d_booknr=71692&amp;d_currency=">this
    book</a> a few weeks ago, and it&#39;s magnificent. It is exhaustively detailed.
    I wish there were an equivalent for Latin script calligraphy and type design!
    It&#39;s in English too. :-&#41;

    I&#39;ll definitely check it out. For Latin, check out Claudio Mediavilla&#39;s
    amazing &#34;Calligraphie&#34; &#40;recently made available in English, I believe&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Ine: I think I remember Claudio Piccinini mentioning that the Khan book
    on Hebrew has actually been translated into English now. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'The best Hebrew calligraphy manual I&#39;ve found is <i>Calligraphy: Hebrew
    Lettering</i> with examplars by Noah Ophir and text by Leila Avrin &#40;who also
    wrote some good stuff on the calligraphy of <i>kettubah</i>, Jewish marriage contracts,
    in <i>Fine Print</i> magazine sometime in the 1980s&#41;. It was published by
    Tav &#40;1993&#41;, in Jerusalem, but I&#39;ve not seen it available from any
    North American sources. I picked up my copy from <a href="http://www.chb.com/company-47246826.html">Falkiner

  body: My book on Hebrew from Gabriel Mandel Khan &#40;in Italian&#41; arrived today,
    and I&#39;m quite dissapointed. The images in the book are often not the original
    photos of bookpages, but are drawings, and they are quite small, so you can&#39;t
    see the letters well.  <BR>And I also hoped that there would have been some info
    about STAM, the special hebrew script, that is used in the Thora, and that has
    to be written in consideration of special rules &#40;to be kosher&#41;; but the
    book doesn&#39;t even mention STAM. <BR>Can you tell me if the books above have
    information on STAM ??

  body: Ine, the established rules for the formation of STAM are written in the <i>Mishnat
    Sofrim</i>. You can find a very good English summary of the rules, with examples,
    at Mordechai Pinchas&#39; excellent sofer resource website. Here is a direct link
    to his pages on <a href="http://www.bayit02.freeserve.co.uk/html/alef_bet.htm">

    in the book by Gabriel Mandel Khan are really not good, he does write about STAM,
    he only calls it SEFER &#40;I&#39;m still quite new to this subject of Hebrew
    and don&#39;t know all the lingo yet&#41; and I must say Italian isn&#39;t as
    easy as I thought it would be ;-&#41; '
