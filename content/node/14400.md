  body: I will guess its a custom drawing of a Bodoni like face. Look at the square
    dot on the I (yuck). I would do a Google search for when this logo was developed
    I bet its pretty old.

  body: Nicolai, I wouldn't <em>dream</em> of disqualifying anyone, and certainly
    not you. You have proven your worth on the Type ID Board time and again. You earned
    a heck of a lot of credits with me. Don't you go anywhere!
