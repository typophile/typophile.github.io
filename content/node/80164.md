  body: "Thanks Riccardo. These sites are quite useful to me. I must confess as I
    can only speak English I don't have a good sense of diacritics, hopefully I can
    develop some sensitivity to them.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused by the project though
    - has the author revised the diacritics in the chosen typefaces? \r\n\r\nAren't
    diacritics based on understood archetypes and designed to match the general design?
    There can't be a right and wrong, surely, just a better or worse?"

    even that. \r\nIt's a question of standards and conventions.\r\nFor instance in
    many graphic genres it is customary to omit accents on capitals, eg sports kit:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sweater_3544.png]\r\n\r\nFor
    display caps, I've seen settings where typographers have made up and manually
    inserted very small accents.\r\nI'm working on a display font with very small
    cap accents at the moment, but am making it up as I go along, as I'm not aware
    of any precedent. Which display fonts have very small accents?"

    happy to omit information that is perhaps unnecessary but isn't this just a matter
    of spelling? Is a missing diacritic considered to be a spelling mistake? Again,
    as somebody who can only speak English I'm fascinated by this extra dimension."

  body: "<cite>Is a missing diacritic considered to be a spelling mistake?</cite>\r\n\r\nIt
    depends on a lot of factors. And, as Nick pointed out, conventions.\r\nFor example,
    in Italian all caps settings, was/is customary to replace accents with apostrophes,
    but never to omit them. This is eased by the fact that accents happen only at
    the end of words and that there are several common words distinguished only by
    one accent. One glaring example is the difference between \"e\", which means \"and\",
    and \"\xE8\", which means \"is\"."
