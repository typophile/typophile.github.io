  to be utmost helpful.\r\nGot a lot of very good clues on pairing fonts here. It
  really is superduper.\r\n\r\nWell, enough with the smalltalk.\r\nI`m working on
  a assignment in my graphic design class, and I`m writing about typograhy, and experimentation
  within this field.\r\n\r\nI thought I could write an article about the range of
  experimenting amongst typographers and/or graphic designers. So, then I thought
  I could ask you guys for help?\r\nI want to show the contrasts between a designer
  who i.ex experiments alot with type, but is only using one certain typeface throughout
  his work (I`m guessing Helvetica or something).\r\n\r\nThis, up against someone
  who is using handwriting as his main tool.\r\n\r\nI was thinking Sagmeister is a
  good example on the handwriting-part?\r\nAnd maybe Marc Atlan on the opposite?\r\n\r\nAnyone?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCheers,
  Mathias"

    Fenwick</a> uses hand-lettering in all of his work. Gorgeous stuff.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bantjes.com/\">Marian
    Bantjes</a> is another great example of hand-lettering. She has teamed up with
    [[Stefan Sagmeister]] before as well."

  body: Hey Tiff, thanks for the post; I'm embarrassed to say I was unaware of Marian's
    work, and she's just across the water from me. I've just sent her a note and look
    forward to making contact with her. So, thanks.

  body: "MissTifany: Thanks a lot, I already check out Marian Bantjes, and I really
    like her work. The Sagmeister co-op is amazing!\r\n\r\nIll sans: Si Scott is alright,
    but I think it is very repetative, and not very impressive in the long run. But
    thanks for the link anyways. I`ve understood he is quite pop these days. Found
    a lot in the second link tough, im into arabic calligraphy now. Hehe"
