body: "I recently graduated from school, but also have a client.\r\n\r\nClient wants
  printed stationary set and other materials.  We want really nice recycled stock,
  will be professionally printed.\r\n\r\nI'm looking to get paper samples and collecting
  those, but kinda confused.\r\n\r\nI think this is a stupid question, but if I find
  paper thats a good fit, will I tell my printer?  Can I use most printers and specify
  the stock even if they don't usually use it?  Whats the best way to find paper samples
  or things like envelopes?\r\n\r\nAnswers would be very appreciated."

    they're using), and whoever their paper supplier is can usually get almost anything
    you want (or a very close equivalent). If they don;t carry the brand you want,
    you can get it yourself, and the printer will print on it.\r\n\r\nYour profile
    says you're in NYC. There's got to be a paper supplier like Xpedx there that has
    a showroom with samples. "

  body: "Hi Ken\r\nI get my paper samples directly from the paper manufacturer. Usually
    printers use\r\ntheir preferred stocks (bulk orders, good deals). But if you are
    after a certain stock\r\nit shouldn't be a problem to get the printer to order
    it in. It will most likely increase\r\nthe cost for the paper, depending on the
    quantity needed. If the printer can't order\r\nit in, they will usually show you
    some similar paper stocks which will match your\r\nsample as close as possible.\r\n\r\nOf
    course this doesn't apply for any online printing facilities (vistaprint etc.).\r\n\r\nI
    think best is if you meet with your printer and discuss your project, this will
    also \r\nhelp with any specs you have to follow, colour profiles etc.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps."

    or finding unusual paper samples?
