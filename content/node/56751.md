    It's just way too hard to read - it nearly made me cross-eyed at first. \r\n\r\nThe
    artifact of 'LETS DESIGN' is also problematic because it reads 'YA OWN OFTWARE'
    not the whole name 'YALETOWN SOFTWARE DESIGN.' "

  body: "Well .. yeah .. I know that at the first glance it reads \"..towns of tware..\".
    But the idea here is that it's not that hard to figure out what it <em>should</em>
    read like. And once you do figure it out, the quirkiness of the initial impression
    makes the logo that much more memorable. I'm pretty sure the next time you see
    it, you will realize you saw it before.\r\n\r\nJust try to view it not as a text,
    but rather as a wordmark. Obviously if a novel were set in such a peculiar way,
    it would've been a disaster :-)\r\n\r\nBTW as some of you may remember we had
    [[http://typophile.com/node/52195|similar discussion before]] in the context of
    the \"precisionetworking\" logo. And this logo is basically an evolution of the
    core idea behind that one."

    must be rather dim then :) I had to go back to the original one to figure out
    what it was supposed to say.\r\n\r\nI'm really struggling for the reading of it
    to become 'intuitive'*. Even when seeing it again, the broken word means I have
    to think deliberately (as Nina said in the other thread 'decipher') to read it.
    It also places emphasis on TWARE. \r\n\r\nAlso the broken word might make me wonder
    about the actual product. Is there a reason you wanted to fit the words on two
    lines?\r\n\r\n* I think the logo should fit with the premise of the user experience
    (e.g. wonderfully easy to read). At this point the logo is slightly vexing. "

  body: "Haha .. that's some quality feedback, guys and gals. Subjective and opinionated,
    the best kind. Thanks a bunch.\r\n\r\n@bendy - well, have you managed to \"decipher\"
    it on your own ? It could've not been THAT hard :)\r\n\r\n@sharon - it typically
    depends on the logo. There's plenty of logos that are effectively puzzles, especially
    those that make a heavy use of a neg space. They look nice at the first glance,
    but you can see something's off and there's something else going on. So you stare
    at them and then there's that AHA moment after which you remember the logo for
    a long time. So, yeah, they don't <em>need</em> to be puzzles, but they certainly
    <em>can</em> be.\r\n\r\n@joe324, @bobbybobo - these are certainly the options,
    but this effectively kills the core idea of my version - the quirkiness. The \"software\"
    is cut up in a strange way on purpose. If it's just \"soft-ware\" or \"software\",
    then the logo is just a collection of three words. They can be made look nice,
    but that's secondary. \r\n\r\n@litera - that's pretty much the exact effect I
    was going for. May be a bit milder and more accepting, but conceptually that's
    it :-) You will remember this logo now, right ?\r\nAlso, regarding what it should
    be saying - if you step back and consider basic color clues, it should be obvious
    how the words are split. Additionally, the logo will almost always be used in
    the context that would suggest it's a computer-related business, so that would
    give yet another parsing clue.\r\n\r\n@ratbaggy - simple and great idea, thanks.
    I will use it.\r\n"

    Not easily at least.\r\n\r\nI do have to add that the target audience is important.\r\nBut
    generaly, this would be the case.\r\n\r\nYou are trying to create an effect like
    an upside down ad in a newspaper or magazine.\r\nI don't turn the magazine or
    paper upside down to read. I don't even sigh or shake my head. I just move on.
    Don't pay attention.\r\n\r\nBut I am sure there is a middle ground. \r\n\r\nIn
    my opinion a logo/brand/identity must give away a few things of the company. \r\nI
    find it important that you will have a general clue about what kind of business
    it is.\r\nBeside that a few core values will help.\r\n\r\nI don't see a software
    company immediately. But it could be.\r\nHowever, you have shown a core value:
    we are not like others. But, is that true?\r\nThe other value you show: we are
    difficult. Are they?\r\n\r\nAt the end of this all:\r\nAfter a while every logo
    will find its way (not saying it is not important) and has its own reason to exist.
    But that is not how I do things.\r\nThere are tons of logo's out there that are
    common ground but could be a bit better.\r\nYou have to get this logo out quit
    a lot for people to understand.\r\nYou have to communicate it over and over.\r\n\r\nThen
    it could work, I think.\r\nEspecially on displaying certain values.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@bobbybobo - I hear you on skipping over stuff that's hard to digest. It's
    a good point regarding the \"we are not like others\" message, which is incidentally
    true and I should've mentioned that at the beginning. It is also an excellent
    point that it says \"we are difficult\", I haven't considered this angle. Thanks
    for that. Any thoughts on how to alleviate this impression ? I realize your version
    does that, but somewhat at the expense of the \"different\" part.\r\n\r\nAll in
    all, just to explain a situation a bit more. It is a small company, and the main
    focus is on the branding of the product rather than the company itself. The product
    is positioned as \"unique, not like others\" and (you are going to like this)
    \"simple\". So in a sense the company logo is secondary, and it just needs to
    be bold, unique and not to compete or contradict the product branding.\r\n\r\n@jakes
    - my take is that in the context of the <em>logo</em> design the readability should
    of course be considered, but it's just one of many factors. Some of these do not
    apply in other cases (e.g. a book design), and the readability floats to the top.\r\n\r\n"
