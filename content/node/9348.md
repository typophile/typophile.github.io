body: hi guys, i&#39;m currently undertaking a large typographical project, and at
  present i am focusing on displaying the script from abbott and costello&#39;s &#39;who&#39;s
  on first&#39; classic  <BR>comedy sketch. as usual i need some advice! <BR> <BR><a

  <BR> <BR>what are the most prominent typefaces from new york around 1930-1955 and
  who were the most influencial type designers of the period.  <BR> <BR>just to give
  you an idea i am trying to project abbott&#39;s physicality and personality through
  a typeface which is to be a little more &#39;sensible&#39;. <BR>and costello as
  a little more dysfunctional &#40;?&#41; and messy. of course i am not there yet,
  but i was looking at cochin for abbott and blockhead &#40;darkside&#41; for costello.
  <BR> <BR>any thoughts are warmly appreciated.
