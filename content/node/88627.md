  you feel about its layout and personality. What do you feel when you look at the
  logo? Do you feel it has a relationship with something else other than photography?
  Is it readable? Does it have potential to be a popular logo? Thank you for your
  feedback!\r\n\r\nHere is the link: http://picgenic.com/"

    at least the \"en\" part."

  body: "To me the logo looks a little dated; reminds me of some logos from a few
    decades ago. Don't know if others would react the same way or not.  \r\n\r\nAnd
    I find my eye drawn to the \"en\" (I agree with riccard0's comment) and to the
    dots on the two \"i\" characters (since they rise above everything else), but
    there's nothing very interesting about them as focal points. Perhaps creating
    something else as a focal point would help. A cap \"P\" maybe, or putting \"Pic\"
    in a different color or weight."

  body: i don't mind the "font" at all... i don't mind the i dots... but purely because
    of the proceeding letters... i see a pig in the EN... the n doesn't have to overlap
    since none of the other letters actually overlap - fixing this will improve the
    logo 100%
