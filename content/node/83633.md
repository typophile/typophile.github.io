body: "i am digitizing a full alphabet for the first time, to be used as part of an
  identity package. i had flirted with this kind of work in the past with individual
  characters, but always stopped short of a full alphabet. \r\n\r\ndiscussions like
  [[http://typophile.com/node/39705|this one]] have been extremely helpful in addressing
  general best practices for vector technique. however, they have largely failed to
  address the very specific considerations involved in drawing digital type.\r\n\r\nmy
  remaining concern is for the finest level of detail \u2014 the best approach to
  bracketing a joint, capping a serif, etc. \r\n\r\ni've taken to inspecting H&FJ
  letterforms for reference, as they seem to be thorough in terms of optical sizes,
  consistent in their execution, i like them. \r\n\r\ni'm interested to hear from
  the community about everyone's respective approach to achieving the best results
  on this purely technical level. \r\n\r\nthe examples I attached are details HTF
  Didot 96 Light. here's what i see as odd/notable/worth considering as I proceed,
  corresponding to numbered images:\r\n1. serifs terminate in rounded caps, but not
  semi-circular caps as would a round-capped stroke in illustrator. the curvature
  of these caps is standardized. likewise, the curvature of the joints is consistent
  throughout \u2014 distance of anchor points from hypothetical corner, positioning
  of handles, everything. this leads me to infer that the responsible parties have
  developed a method to standardize these elements.\r\n2. however, in some cases,
  curves I would expect to be consistent are not quite consistent, leading me to believe
  that the responsible parties are simply eyeballing it \u2014 extremely accurately
  \u2014 or that some judgment beyond my abilities has been applied to this case.\r\n3.
  strokes, though they appear consistent throughout, are actually inconsistent between
  horizontal/vertical/diagonal instances. this formal inconsistency appears to be
  consistent in its application.\r\n\r\nwhat is the best way to address these issues?
  the simplest aspect of the question seems to be that of standardization of brackets/caps
  (which seems like it should be an easy software issue, but i have found no easier
  way than transplanting one curve over and over. this is tedious; seems stupid; i
  don't want to do it).\r\n\r\nthe questions suggested be 2-3 seem to be broader questions
  of drawing methodology. i have inferred certain relatively common, deliberate inconsistencies
  in letterform design (the lower curve of a capital S, O, J, etc. descending below
  the baseline to achieve the appearance of sitting on the baseline, for example)
  which appear to be relatively standardized. are the issues of 2-3 comparable? if
  so, how does one best negotiate them?\r\n\r\nmany thanks."

    element/level of design that you are considering here is the opposite of technical
    (in the general sense of something that may be reduced to standard procedure),
    and is entirely subjective and a matter of taste and discretion, which may only
    be developed/acquired through study and practice.\r\n\r\nRather than standards
    in executing such things as overshoot, there is the consensus of general practice,
    and exemplars\u2014reliable practitioners.\r\nBut you will soon reach your ceiling
    as a designer if you only follow precedent, and don't experiment and make mistakes."

  body: "Alright, thank you \u2014 I think these are very helpful points. In cases
    like overshoot, in which the consensus of general practice has rendered some approximate
    standard, such standards are useful to know (and I didn't know that one). As long
    as I'm not slaving away solving problems that have already been solved (within
    the bounds of reason), I'm happy to do it the slow and difficult way \u2014 which
    I agree is generally the most auspicious. Many thanks again."

  body: "Here's an interesting piece of overshoot trivia: Univers Light has overshoot
    on the \"I\".\r\nThis was a feature of the face when it was first introduced (mentioned
    in advertising), and has made it into digital.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HI_3794.png]\r\n\r\nIMO,
    PostScript has resulted in typefaces becoming far more regularized than with previous
    technologies, constrained by Stem Width and Alignment Zones for hinting purposes.
    Before the invention of Alignment Zones, the concept of overshoot did not exist
    for the type designer as such a neatly visible, regularizing imperative.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nI'm
    presently working on a rounded sans\u2014it's a real pain to figure out the overshoots."

  body: "Nick, that's precisely the kind of feature that, had you not pointed out
    it's intended presence, I would have put down to poor quality digitising. I wonder
    why it overshoots at the top and not at the bottom too?\r\n\r\nAs a novice, examining
    existing fonts can create a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand a feature may exist
    a certain way because the designer possesses some judgement beyond your abilities
    (as you put it) This is a conscious decision on their behalf, but with only limited
    experience one can't necessarily fathom it. On the other hand the designer might
    indeed have made an error, or not yet be experienced enough to do a more sophisticated
    job (not likely with H&FJ, mind). When I begun I knew of fewer optical corrections
    than I do now. With that in mind I imagine there are more mysterious corrections
    to learn about such as the one that Nick has posted above, the more mysterious
    they get the less general consensus will surround them, I imagine.\r\n\r\nAlso
    bear in mind that fonts are drawn on an explicit grid (unlike Illustrator) and
    this may account for some (rather frustrating) discrepancies."
