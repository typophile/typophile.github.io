    but you want to use something else? Why not simply use Parisine Plus? It doesn&#39;t
    bite, yaknow. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Let me guess: you don&#39;t want to pay the license
    fee for the real thing, so you&#39;d like to find a cheap or even free lookalike.
    <BR>Usually it doesn&#39;t work that way. Ask yourself why Jean-Fran'

  body: Sorry Yves and Jean, <BR> <BR>but this is not the reason. A big magazine in
    germany use the parasine plus so i don&#39;t want to use it too because i need
    it also for a magazine. <BR> <BR>But i like the character alot

    I can say: there&#39;s more than enough room for some extra <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/Alphabets/ParisinePlus.asp"
    target="_blank"> Parisine Plus</a> in Germany, trust me. A delightful face like
    that is not likely to get overused that quickly. And it&#39;s just as much <i>HOW</i>
    you use it. I just did three different magazine designs using Tarzana, and they
    couldn&#39;t be further apart &#40;I need to get some mileage out of my license

  body: 'Yes, I&#39;m interested too! It&#39;s all too rare I&#39;ve seen it in use:
    Parisine Plus is not well-known here in Belgium. If you don&#39;t have a url,
    maybe a scan of cover and a few pages would make my day &#40;unless it&#39;s available
    in Belgium, in which case I can go check it out in a magazine shop&#41;.'

  body: ParisinePlus is one of those typefaces that really can do many different things.
    The variety of weights was is one reason it is invaluable. The elegance of the
    italic. This is not a typeface to be considered a flash in the pan. <BR> <BR>I
    very happy I purchased it and hope to add Parisine to my library this year. ;^&#41;  <BR>
    <BR>So what is this other magazine using ParisinePlus?

  body: heh heh, too much for me! thanks all my friends. <BR> <BR>John idea is not
    so irrealist but at minor level. Based on Parisine, it can be possible to ad some
    special unique features, whithout redesigning everything. and It will cost less
    than a pure custom font that guys such John Hudson can also able to do, too.
