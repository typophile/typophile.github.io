body: "\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI need help to identify the font used in the PIN-UP Magazine
  Issue 6. It is a grotesque font. The form-principle is similar to Helvetica, Akzidenz.
  But it has some special characteristics, like the lowercase a, or the uppercase
  R. Maybe its custom made?\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know this font?\r\n\r\nNitzki\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PIN_UP__6524.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/PIN_UP_0001_5384.jpg]"

  body: PIN-UP magazine surprised me by their nice use of arial for display use. it's
    hideous that they use it for bodycopy through the whole magazine, but their use
    of it for display sizes, especially on the cover, really does look good. i had
    to take a second glance too to check that it's really arial that looks that good.
