  body: 'I''m a fan of Gordon Rugg''s work on the Voynich manuscript, especially his
    demonstration that it is possible to produce meaningless text that exhibits the
    structures of meaningful text. That implies two things: a) that despite the results
    of people who find semantic structures in the text it could still be a hoax, and
    b) that if it is a hoax it was made by a really brilliant person who did something
    extraordinary.'
