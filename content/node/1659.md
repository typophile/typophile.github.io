    in the first place. My day job is making veer.com look pretty. And Condensed Gothic
    is one of my favourite pixel fonts. <BR> <BR>On a related note, I also have converted
    all of Mark&#39;s old bitmap fonts for use on my Newton. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: <i>&#62; My day job is making veer.com look pretty.</i> <BR> <BR>A job damn
    well done, if I may be so bald &#40;!&#41;. Especially  <BR>when I compare it
    to MyFonts &#40;kindergarten design&#41; and  <BR>Fonts.com &#40;whaddamess&#41;.
    Veer is classy, stylish and mighty  <BR>purty.

  body: The current suitcase full of faces that Mark has on his site does not work
    properly with OS X because it were generated using FONT bitmap resources rather
    than NFNT resources. I converted the Condensed Gothic weights with Fontographer
    so I could still use them under OS X and <a href="http://www.splorp.com/blog/archive/2003_05_01_archive.html#200330684">blogged
    about it here</a>. <BR> <BR>I could probably send you a copy of my converted version,
    providing it&#39;s ok with Mark... <BR> <BR>That being said, Mark <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/">is
    re-releasing the faces</a> as Raster Gothic Condensed - an expanded, hand-tuned
    family with outlines - very soon, or so I&#39;ve been told.
