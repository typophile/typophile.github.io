  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am thinking of drawing a script font based on someone&#39;s handwriting. The writing comes from an old document, it&#39;s a registry that was maintained by a general store owner, a long time ago, to see who bought what and how much they owed him, etc. I have access to photocopies of this document. All rights on it were donated by the family of the owner to a historical society in my area. I was thinking of naming the font after his name. <BR> <BR>I have a lot of questions regarding this type of project.  <BR> <BR>What are the standard guidelines regarding copyrights or commercial royalties on these types of fonts?  <BR> <BR>When someone is dead, are there any types of rights on their writing? &#40;Or are there even rights when they are alive?&#41; If there are, would they belong to the family or to whoever is the owner of the source inspiration for the font?  <BR> <BR>Has anyone done this and gotten in trouble before? If so, what kind? :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR>Em</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Emilie, I did something similar to that for a Uni project. Except in my case all I had to work off was the TO: address on the envelope. However, the idiosyncracies in the handwriting intrigued me... I will post in the critiques section sooner or later, so we&#39;ll see what kind of legal issues this brings up then. <BR> <BR>P.S. This letter was not personal, and was sent from a company in New Zealand, so it&#39;s simply called Kiwi Casual, but I&#39;m not final on that name.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Emilie, first thing I would do is contact the historical society in question. Explain exactly what your intentions are, and make clear that you want to make a commercial font for sale. This is very important, especially because you&#39;d like to use the person&#39;s name as well. Definitely keep a paper trail of all correspondence.  <BR> <BR>One other thing about doing it together with the historical society is that they may be willing and able to provide some form of promotion/exposure for your endeavour. <BR> <BR>BTW, how did you obtain the copies? If they are available to the public, there&#39;s a chance they may be in the public domain &#40;i.e. copyright-free&#41;. <BR> <BR>I designed a typeface based on a person&#39;s handwriting, after we signed a contract to split the proceeds from the sale. Now that font is going to be released by Bitstream &#40;hopefully, this summer&#41;.</div>
