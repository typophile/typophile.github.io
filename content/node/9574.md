  calls for some Old English characters -- the thorn &amp; eth are of course already
  in the font, but we also need a wynn &amp; yogh &amp; paet &#40;easy to make&#41;
  &amp; the ampersand that looks like an os &#34;7&#34;. <BR> <BR>Anybody know of
  a Baskerville close to &#34;New Baskerville&#34; that has these?&#34; <BR> <BR>TIA,

  body: ?? you mean of Baskerville, or of the Old English glyphs? Actually, I suppose
    it&#39;s moot, I have no way of posting either . . .

  body: Charles <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t know if this will help you or if it is in your
    budget but Michael Bixler does superb Monotype composition that he can furnish
    in camera ready copy &#40;he supplied the comp for the earlier Edward Tufte books&#41;
    and he has the English Baskerville 169 with all the characters you need. We did
    an 1830&#39;s entymological dictionary a very long ways back with metal type furnished
    by Bixler and it required all these characters, and more. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.mwbixler.com/"

  body: Baskerville is not the problem, but I have NO idea what an wynn, a yogh or
    a paet might look like. Judging by the lack of response on the board I&#39;m guessing
    I&#39;m not alone.  <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t honestly believe you have no way of posting
    samples! Have you never heard of Google?

  body: You could take a look at the <a href="http://www.engl.virginia.edu/OE/junicode/junicode.html"
    target="_blank"> Junicode</a> font. It seems to have the glyphs you want.

  body: Patternmaker -- Thanks, the Junicode fonts will be useful. <BR> <BR>Ms. Fabricant
    -- You can get an idea of what these characters look like from the Unicode chart,
    Latin Extended B -- their Unicode values are 021C &#40;cap Yogh&#41;, 021D &#40;lowercase
    yogh&#41;, 01F7 &#40;cap Wynn&#41; 01BF &#40;lowercase wynn&#41;. <BR> <BR>But,
    and the reason samples don&#39;t help if you don&#39;t know Old English, the runic
    characters from which some are borrowed, as well as variations in both scribal
    forms &amp; 17th century fonts is, for example, that 01B7 can &amp; has also served
    as a cap Yogh, as well as another glyph also known as the &#34;Old English g&#34;

    I don&#39;t think this violates the EULA, as long as you don&#39;t roll the whole
    thing into a font and try to distribute it. <BR> <BR>I couldn&#39;t really find
    a good example of a modernized &#39;ond&#39; character, though. <BR> <BR><!--attachment:
