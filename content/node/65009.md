body: "i need to finish a project in photoshop. Im making a new page that resembles
  my previous ones, but i didnt save the previous ones as a PSD, therefore i cant
  view the layers and see what font i used. The pages are in JPG and I have no idea
  how to tell what fonts these are. I went through the ones already on my computer
  and I dont think I have them, so I need to know which fonts they are so I can see
  if I can download them. This is for a huge project that I need to finish ASAP. Any
  help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\r\n\r\n**I need to know which font i
  used in each paragraph. I believe they are two different fonts. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WTF_5124.jpg]"
