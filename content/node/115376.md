  post Graduation final project. It will be projected for a Craft magazine and I am
  looking for some good typefaces that I could use as a reference for my studying.\r\nDo
  you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, \r\n\r\ncheers, \r\n"

    body: "You are totally right, Hrant, I forgot to say that: the typeface is supposed
      to look elegant for big titles, like 48 pt size, for magazines of Arts & Crafts.\r\nThe
      aims of my project have to do with unbracketed serifs, certain contrast, humanist
      axis and a x-height relatively small. At first, I will develop a regular weight
      and later, variations like bold and italic.\r\nSo far, this is all I have.\r\n\r\nThanks
      again, "
