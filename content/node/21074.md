    there is a connection to Centaur somehow; but it's also, in a sense, a geometric
    sans that'll provide the needed contrast.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I've found that
    <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=kievit\">FF
    Kievit</a> (my new favorite sans!) works well with almost any Garalde out there."

    I'm a Freelance Pre-Press Artist/Illustrator, and I'm wanting to redesign my resumes/invoices/other
    materials. I love type/letterforms, but am far from being an \"expert\" at identification,

    with Venetian serif, only Garalde), then what about changing your Centaur to Jenson
    (many versions are abound) or the less used but still beautiful New Winchester
    (although there's a lot of criticism surrounding its digitization.)

  body: "Palatine,\r\n\r\nWith all due respect, a \"poor\" digitization of Centaur
    is still ten times better than a lot of recently designed typefaces. There is
    nothing inherently wrong with it, it's just that we could have had something much
    better. (By the way, my son recently picked up an abridged version of Narnia,
    set in Centaur, probably because there are centaurs in the book!)\r\n\r\nJust
    because Bringhurst and Dean Allen pointed that out to you doesn't mean Centaur
    is unusable.\r\n\r\nNow for companion -- Centaur for titling works well, so perhaps
    you don't need one?"

    for a different script complement.

  body: Letterpress can change the tone of the most stubborn typeface. I'd be willing
    to bet the qualities we dislike in Centaur would disappear (for the most part)
    once letter-pressed. Where it is spindly it will be rendered more bold, where
    it is crisp it will be made soft. Letterpress is the perfect answer for seeing
    a typeface in a whole new light.

    indeed your intention to go all out on the printing side, why not locate a press
    that still possess Centaur matrices and have them print it?  I know that a small
    place in Portland set their letterpress stuff on Bembo, among many others; so,
    really, the possibility of finding such printer is not that hard.\r\n\r\nOoh,
    I can't even imagine to think how beautiful would Centaur's italic look on letterpress!"

    In my opinion, it truly changes everything, from being able to get a more faithful
    version of Centaur on metal to getting that warm, charming look on print.\r\n\r\nAfter
    all, ginapaloma, in a world where offset and gravure run the cogs of commerce,
    taking part in the creation of a letterpress ephemera is every typophile's dream
    -- a romantic one, we can say.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which, your color scheme is
    really interesting. I've seen a color similar to PMS 396 used in a small press'
    short-run bookmark, but I never saw the likes of PMS 271. I would love to see
    how it all worked out."
