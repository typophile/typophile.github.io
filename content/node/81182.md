  body: I'm trying to re-type the text from this old 70's era UK record sleeve, and
    the font I thought was Futura isn't quite an exact match. The round characters
    are about the same but anything with a long ascender or descender is much shorter
    in the original text than what I type in Futura. Any suggestions? Thanks

    the rounding off of the strokes due to optical overshoot from the exposure. So
    you probably won\u2019t find an exact match."
