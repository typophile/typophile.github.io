  body: "One thing we learned at the dinner last night with Alejandro Paul is that
    there are many, many South American faces that we never see in the North. South
    American papers and magazines are now much more likely to use homegrown fonts
    than they did in the past. This may be one.\r\n\r\nSee <a href=\"http://www.letraslatinas.com/\">Letras
    Latinas</a>."
