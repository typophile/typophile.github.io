  body: It is like the person who asked what font was used for Brother Bears movie
    by Disney. Disney makes theme park rides from their movies. They can afford to
    hire a designer to create a unique look that they can market and sell. The same
    is true for any big auto manufacturer or any other entertainment company.

  body: Well, I was wondering - since, after all, they use the exact same style of
    writing on the Boxster, Carerra and Cayenne. <BR> <BR>Thanks anyway. I guess I&#39;ll
    have to try my own hand.

    they probably had a custom typeface made, not  <BR>the separate logos. Here&#39;s
    a <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/Custom/Lion.html" target="_blank"> nice
    example</a> of another  <BR>automobile company who commissioned such a typeface.
