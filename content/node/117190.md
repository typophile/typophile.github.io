    or my client will have to live with a tracing. Can't nobody get no custom font
    downloaded!"

  body: "Thanks Mike :) I didn't remember this one at first sight, firstly thought
    it could be a bespoke and by Fontsmith (mainly because of the single storey /a,
    earmark of Fontsmith) but I was wrong. Then I checked [[http://www.northtarrantexpress.com|North
    Tarrant Express]] website hoping for a webfont or a good PDF. No luck. And finally
    thought somebody would have previously asked for it, checked [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/395825|MyFonts
    WhatTheFont Forum]] and found the answer (thanks of Akira1975 as usual I would
    say).\r\n"

  body: Well, then thanks to both you and Akira1975. Hopefully my client can scrounge
    up the source vector file. If not, I may have to contact Ferrovial, the parent
    company of the contractor I'm working with.
