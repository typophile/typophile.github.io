    &#34;e&#34;s. than agian i could be wrong? <BR>thanks for the help tho. <BR>regards,

  body: That was done by hand. The e&#39;s on the right one look the same because
    of the effects applied to them. You could do a search for &#34;monoline script&#34;
    at myfonts and maybe turn up something similar.
