body: "Recently, I started a new job at a firm using a font called NaturaRoman for
  its text.\r\n\r\nI have since learned that NaturaRoman (although I have it in ttf
  and Mac PS 1) does not\r\ntechnically exist. Someone created it from Requiem by
  Hoefler.\r\n\r\nSo, I have a problem. Obviously, I cannot use the ttf file for production
  work. And I am working on a Windows OS machine, so the Mac PS 1 version I have won't
  work either.\r\n\r\nSo, I need a Windows PS 1 version of NaturaRoman, Italic, what
  have you ...\r\n\r\nOr, I could purchase Requiem. Not a problem. But I am unclear
  whether or not the 3\r\nweights Hoefler mentions on www.typography.com (Fine, Display
  and Text) translate to what\r\nI'm used to as Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic,
  Small Caps, Swashes, etc.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I am looking at font substitution issues.
  I can deal with those but what I can't deal with is the thought of sending a True
  Type font (even with outlines which might shift my InDesign layout when preparing
  for RIP.)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? Anyone familiar with NaturaRoman? Under the info
  on a Mac OS X I have found that the Nature Conservancy produced via a license from
  Hoefler ... what the heck is that?\r\n\r\nKills me how people can rip off font designers

    They don't know or remember how it came to them. They think from another client.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, I would argue what the heck they were doing using it for our identity
    package in the first place.\r\n\r\nThey should have used Requiem.\r\n\r\nCan you
    believe I'm losing sleep over this? Got up at 3:45 a.m. est with worries of True
    Type fonts on a Windows machine.\r\n\r\nThe unknown gets me. There is a right
    way to work and this is not it."

  body: "Hi William,\r\n\r\n\r\nNatura is indeed a variant of Requiem, which was made
    for The Nature Conservancy. We (and they) have since replaced it with Requiem
    proper, as well as some new variations of Requiem that eagle-eyed typophiles might
    notice at http://www.nature.org.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the Natura fonts, just
    let us know and we can arrange a license for you. We'll throw in Requiem as well,
    since I think you'll like it better (The Nature Conservancy did!) Feel free to
    e-mail me offlist, or contact Romeo Ruz at my office for speedier service, at
    ruz at typography.com.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I hope that while any of you are scoping
    out the typography on The Nature Consevancy's site, you'll take a moment to learn
    about the organization. They're fighting the good fight for our environment, and
    they're one of the many non-profit organizations that H&FJ is especially proud
    to be working with.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan "
