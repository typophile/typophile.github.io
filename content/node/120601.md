body: "Hello everybody! I am pretty new to typeface design but I do have an interest
  in learning the process of designing my own typeface. This typeface design was intended
  as a research project, however the deadline's pretty tight so I have only another
  2 days to complete the full uppercase and numeral sets. \r\n\r\nBasically, I am
  aiming to design a sans serif, geometric typeface that I like to coin as the \"lovechild
  of Futura and Gotham\". I will be taking some characteristics from Futura and Gotham,
  and combining them to create a softer yet bolder typeface. This typeface was made
  to be a header font, hence the heavier body weight. I have not gotten all the letters
  right, so the image seen here is just what I have so far. Also any suggestions to
  characteristics that I could add to further differentiate my typeface from Futura
  / Gotham or any other geometric sans serifs that are already out there? \r\n\r\nAny
  critique and suggestion will be very useful at this point. Thank you in advance!
  :)\r\n\r\nPS: This is my first time designing a typeface, so any tips would greatly
  appreciated too. Cheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fotham

    you're trying to be highly derivative, the technical issues require a great deal
    of attention.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Indeed, this isn't going to work. I think you would do well to study the
    basic principles of type design first. For one, horizontal strokes are optically
    thicker so you need to compensate for that. You didn't, so all your horizontals
    look too thick. Here's a great source to study some basic principles: http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\r\n\r\nAnd
    here you can find more resources: http://temple-of-typefaces.deviantart.com/journal/Type-resources-276795259\r\nAlso
    have a look at the other blog posts. I have a few tutorials on how to design a
    typeface.\r\n\r\nAlso, don't think you can get a great typeface by combining popular
    ones. Especially if you're not well versed in type design, it can quickly become
    a monstrosity. Try to design your own typefaces. You learn a lot more by doing
    so. I can recommend to just keep experimenting, keep researching and keep looking
    at other people's designs. Reading the criticism people leave here on other people's
    typefaces can also be greatly beneficial as you get more insight into what works
    and what doesn't according to the professionals, rather than guessing what works.
    You first need to have knowledge before certain issues become obvious. For example,
    you probably didn't know that horizontal strokes look optically thicker, and so
    you didn't see that issue."

    body: Thank you so much for the resources, it would definitely be useful to go
      through them and continue experimenting. I've already handed in my work, but
      will continue to work on the typeface during my free time. Might take a few
      years but I'll get there! :)
