body: I have a font I'm working on, basically all I have is upper and lowercase, figures,
  some puncuation.  Now that I'm just about happy with these glyphs I want to expand
  the set.  I have noticed that none of the empty glyph spots have names anymore in
  names mode.  What I basically want to do is take my glyphs together with their metrics
  info, and I guess kind of paste them into blank font file with the basic latin 256
  standard unicode layout.

  body: "Have you tried saving (save as) the existing .vfb file under a different
    name and then changing the relevant metadata in the new file? Alternatively you
    could choose different encoding options until you find what you are looking for
    in terms of characters.\r\n\r\nYou might find it useful to look at the PDF code
    charts for <em>Controls and Basic Latin</em> (range 0000\u2013007F) and <em>Controls
    and Latin-1 Supplement</em> (range 0080\u201300FF) which can be found through
    the [[http://unicode.org/charts/|Unicode Consortium Code Charts page]].\r\n\r\nYou

  body: "From your description, I guess the letters in FontLab's Names view are all
    showing up (with blank names) clustered together at the bottom, and the yellow-labelled
    cells showing glyph names are currently sitting empty?\r\n\r\nIf so, you can just
    highlight your glyphs and drag them onto the proper name cells using the mouse.
    \ You can even do them in batches as long as the consecutive target cells match
    up with how the glyphs are currently ordered...\r\n\r\nYou can do the same thing
    in Unicode view to make sure their codepoints are correct as well.\r\n\r\n(The
    above at least works in Windows, I assume it does under MacOS as well.)"
