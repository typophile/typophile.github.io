  body: It *appears* to be very nice, but it's hard to say because your images are
    too low res... Please put up larger images!

  body: "I did that a few times too. The delete button at the bottom, stay away from
    it. The check boxes should be the only thing you use to handle attachments. one
    will say list ( i think ) and the other delete. i think just check the action
    you want taken w/the file and hit 'submit'. I think.\r\n\r\nI think that is a
    pixelfont. am i correct?"

    yeah, I'll put in an image with the upper and lowercase together. All in favour
    say '\u2206'."

  body: "chris, i really like the directions you tackle with your pixel font designs.
    they are not easy directions, really. the larger the pixel font, the more frail
    it appears, imo, making every pixel and its placement really count.\r\n\r\nin
    some ways, making a 'traditional' pixel font of this type is more difficult than
    making a 'gray' pixel font. placement of each 'notch' must be in the spirit of
    the overall design, and in a funny sort of way, actually becomes the spirit of
    the design, just as much as the overall shapes your glyphs are built from.\r\n\r\nyou
    might try to build these as non-italics fonts too. i believe they'd be slightly
    more sophisticated in their achievement.\r\n\r\nwhat do i mean by that?\r\n\r\nas
    it stands, your designs evoke the idea of sophistication (at least to me), but
    the actual execution of the idea is a little shaky. this is not your fault at
    all. this just comes from pushing the envelope--and creating a large, one-pixel
    wide cursive italics font is just about as difficult as it gets."
