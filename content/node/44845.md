  typography sucks</a>, but it's like the weather: everybody complains, but nobody
  does anything about it. Well, now <em>you</em> can. As a member of the World Wide
  Web Consortium's CSS Work Group (the group the defines how styles work in Web pages),
  I recently took on the duty of advocate and editor for <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work#fonts\"
  target=\"external\">CSS Fonts</a> (how fonts are displayed) and <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work#webfonts\"
  target=\"external\">CSS Web Fonts</a> (downloadable fonts). These specifications
  define the core styles for Web typography.\r\n\r\nBy and large the CSS specifications
  have not had a lot of input from designers, the very people who use them every day.
  Let's change that! I'm working on the revised specifications to present at a CSS
  Work Group meeting in August, and I want your ideas on what we can do to improve
  typography on the Web. \r\n\r\nTo participate, read my <a href=\"http://www.webbedenvironments.com/blog/index.php/2008/04/29/web-typography-tell-me-what-you-want/\"
  target=external\">blog entry on webbedENVIRONMENTS calling for feedback</a> and
  then post your ideas on my blog or here in this Typophile Forum thread.\r\n\r\nHelp
  me Typophile, you're my only hope!"

  body: "I'm pretty happy with the CSS3 Web Fonts draft. If only browsers would start
    to support it. \r\n\r\nWishlist:\r\n-automatic hyphenation (something like \xBBlanguage:de-at\xAB
    in a CSS rule.The browser would then do the hyphenation according to the specified
    language)\r\n-a CSS-based system for protecting commercial webfonts (limiting
    the use of a font to a certain domain)\r\n\r\n\r\nfont-size-adjust, font-stretch,
    and font-smooth are very good additions. For example, it's almost impossible to
    mix the ClearType fonts with the older core fonts in smaller sizes. font-size-adjust
    could fix that. \r\n\r\n\r\nBTW: I just did a survey about webfonts among webdesigners:

  body: "3 naive expectations:\r\n-Looking good on screen (Win OS, Mac OS) and looking
    acceptable, if printed with a user's printer\r\n-Having similar design to typefaces
    used in print, s.th. like webversions of them\r\n-Easy (intuitive) to work with
    (CSS, Javascript) \u2026\r\n\r\nThink corporate design; you want colors, layout,
    typefaces, etc. in all media looking similar, or if it's possible, the same. Okay,
    most of the people are far from expecting the clone, but as more it can get derived
    from existing print layouts, the better \u2013 we want consistency, the client
    wants it also. Don't get me wrong, i don't expect a 7- columns in a mobile phone
    browser :) \r\n\r\nWe need more Arial/Helvetica (or compareable Grotesks with
    the same first impression), Georgia/Miller, etc., which are easy to use. The money
    thing wouldn't really matter (if \"reasonable prices\" were demanded), if i can
    tell (and show live on the monitor) the client the big advantage  consistency
    can bring.  \r\n\r\nIt gets difficult, if the designer wants to get off the beaten
    track \u2013 The only way open to us is pictures, sIFR for headlines, Flash (.swf-Format)
    now. Maybe you are a part of the \"change\".\r\n\r\nGood luck (for all of us)\r\n\r\nBTW
    I did the 4th project within 6 months using Verdana as a textface for websites.
    Germany is a \"sans land\" so i can only go with Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Lucida
    Sans to replace a decent sans-design we're using in print.   "

  body: "Seems like a lot of these requests really fall outsize of the W3C and web
    specifications. These seems issues closer to DRM, browser rendering engines, etc.\r\n\r\nAs
    for CSS specific requests:\r\n\r\n - more specific/narrow generic font families
    (beyond sans, serif, etc.)\r\n - do NOT include some effects (stretching type...3-d...etc.)\r\n
    - concept of columns (I think that's already in the queue)\r\n"

  body: "Not a CSS request, but an HTML one - a caption tag that applies not just
    to tables, but can be used for image captions; one of the tags I wish for most.
    \ For CSS, I'd like the ability to associate various font properties with a given
    family, such that I could list something like:\r\n\r\nfont: Myriad bold 1em, Univers
    300 1.2em, Verdana normal .88em, normal sans .8em\r\n\r\nThis is clearly problematic
    syntax, but I hope it demonstrates the sort of behavior I'd like to see...   I
    assume it's too far out there, though.  ;)\r\n\r\n---\r\neeblet.com"
