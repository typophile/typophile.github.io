    Super Cache</a> to improve loading times as much as possible and <a href=\"https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/\">WP
    Smush</a> to compress your images.\r\nAlso, installing the YSlow browser extension
    will show you why your page is loading slowly and how to improve loading times.
