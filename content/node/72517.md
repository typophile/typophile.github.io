body: After reading many chapters of Noordzij's writing, I'm beginning to question
  my own handwriting. Exactly what sort of handwriting would G.N. approve of? I'm
  left-handed, but  I've taken to practicing my current letter constructions with
  my right-hand, with the intention of making the jump to right-handed calligraphy
  a bit simpler. Any ideas on where I should start learning to relearn handwriting?

    calligraphers (and some heated discussion about it here on Typophile)."

  body: "It couldn't hurt to be able to control a pen with either hand, could it?
    That way, if there was any particular calligraphic style better suited to a particular
    orientation, I could make the switch without too much fuss.\r\n\r\nThat was my
    reasoning, at any rate. Also, if I lost one of my hands in some sort of industrial
    accident, I wouldn't be out of a hobby (or job, hopefully.)"
