  faint visual memories of some mid-century modern lettering I've seen through my
  travels. I'm hoping someone out there can look at what I have so far and point me
  to some existing typefaces or lettering that evoke this \"style\" so I may reference
  them to perfect the whole thing! \r\nI would also love some general feedback and
  guidance if people are willing to share it!\r\nThanks!\r\nJames\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fiftyfifty_6028.png]"

  body: I also notice that it takes a while to realize that one is supposed to be
    reading the black. At first looks I was trying to read the whites and accordingly
    seeing them as patterns not letters . . .
