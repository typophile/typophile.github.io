body: Hi all, <BR>I have two sets of Friz Quadrata -- one with the regular and heavy
  version, the other with the oblique version.  The only problem is that the oblique
  one has a different name, which makes it quite a pain to use in InDesign CS.  Is
  there any way I can merge the fonts together? <BR> <BR>Thanks. <BR>-Will

    styles. Are you OS X or OS 9?
