    Surely this says the combination <em>seems</em> to be unusual and tasty (but implies
    that it may actually not be)?\r\n\r\nNot that that's a type issue at all, of course.

  body: "thanks a bunch guys.\r\n\r\nDTW in response to the use of the word 'seemingly'.The
    ad is suppose to promote a new flavor. I chose a combo of vanilla and Lucky Charms.
    Weird combo but tasty. I thought back to a time were someone might have experimented
    with adding chocolate to milk. And like most things new, they are often met with
    ridicule and skepticism. Imagine someone coming up to you with a 'new' spin on
    something you drank for years with no additives. Just pure milk. Some might say
    it looks like 'dirty milk'. But as time went on people loved it. i thought i could
    use that same story with this ad. But maybe if it's too vague i would definately
    welcome suggestion.\r\n\r\nTim i think i will use em dashes. I really want to
    enphasize the word tatsty. Maybe even italicize the word."

  body: "I would write it like this:\r\n\r\n<strong>Not since the addition of chocolate
    to milk has there \r\nbeen such an unusual yet tasty combination.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
    #1 rule when writing ad copy is to keep it simple. The same applies, or should
    apply to all kinds of writing, eg:\r\n\r\nGood writing is simple and easy to understand.\r\n\r\nYou
    don't need to say any more. Adding words to that sentance or trying to be more
    specific---or clever---would only complicate it and make it bad writing. Stick
    to the point. Most attempts to be clever produce self-conscious \"writerly\" prose.
    A staggering number of internet users exhibit this trait, trying to mimic what
    they think is the scholarly authorative tone of professional writers. It's a plague.
    Blog owners are the worst afflicted.\r\n\r\nKeeping it simple includes a simple
    approach to punctuation. Where possible leave out commas. I understand why you
    put those commas where you put them---they seem like they should be there when
    you analyse the sentance structure. But they don't really need to be there. Inexperienced
    writers tend to add commas when reading back what they've written at a slow, analytical
    speed. The falacy is that people reading your text don't read at that speed; they
    read as fast as possible because they've left the oven on at home and need to
    catch the 5:17PM bus.\r\n\r\n\"Seemingly\" is best left out for 3 very good reasons.
    1) It complicates the sentance. 2) Ad copy can't be ambiguous. The product either
    is an unusual yet tasty combination, or it isn't. No two ways about it. To convince
    readers and make them absorb the message you must be decisive. 3) \"Seemingly\"
    adds another word to the count. A slogan has to be breif.\r\n\r\n<em>em dashes
    could be used as they would draw more attention to the word tasty.</em>\r\n\r\nDepends.
    Being a big user of the em dash I often recommend them in favour of commas. Will
    this be set in a text font using text setting conventions, or in display type
    using display typography?\r\n\r\n<strong>Not since the addition of chocolate to
    milk has there \r\nbeen such an unusual---yet tasty---combination.</strong>\r\n\r\nThat
    is more effective, but you end up hanging on \"combination\". Here's the solution:\r\n\r\n<strong>Not
    since the addition of chocolate to milk has there \r\nbeen such an unusual---yet
    tasty combination.</strong>\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to use color and size---make
    \"tasty\" bigger & louder, sans em dashes.\r\n\r\nYou could also spice up the
    writing to give it context and make it less technical, more colloqial. <em>Who</em>
    added milk to chocolate?\r\n\r\n<strong>Not since they added chocolate to milk
    has there \r\nbeen such an unusual---yet tasty combination.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe
    ubiquitous, ever-present, anonymous \"they\".\r\n\r\nWhat else could you do? Bung
    an ellipsis on the end to add a sense of mystery & intrigue, the air of inuendo.
    There's more to this icy-cream ;-) than the ad reveals, but if you don't buy one
    you'll never find out. Good ad copy is always ambiguous in some way. What you
    don't say is as important, sometimes more important than what you do say.\r\n\r\n<strong>Not
    since they added chocolate to milk has there \r\nbeen such an unusual---yet tasty
    combination...</strong>\r\n\r\nCan I ask what kind of course you're taking the
    exam for? Design or advertising? Something else?\r\n\r\nEdit: Ivan, you posted
    your response just before I posted mine :^)\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    to who, and in what kind of publication? In a technical paper maybe. In a magazine
    article or newspaper em dashes are less used than commas by editors. In a novel
    em dashes are widely used and accepted by readers.\r\n\r\nAd copy writers do whatever
    they like, because they can, and consumers don't take advertising copy seriously,
    if they notice it at all. Confounding Marshall Macluhan, the medium is not the
    message---the message is the message.\r\n\r\nAdvertising---gone today...gone tomorrow.

    pudding, yoghurt, canned peaches...any kind of food eaten with or without a dish

    job of capturing the imagination and involving us emotionally. The dish running
