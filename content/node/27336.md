    your original .vfb, or in the .otf or .ttf which you generated from it?\r\n\r\nAs
    to the warning, have you checked if there is there are classes with the same name
    but with different content?\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "In the .otf, classes have different names than in the .vfb; don't expect
    to find your original names. Also, feature code may look a bit different in the
    .otf.\r\n\r\nNo duplicate class names, then this is strange. You assigned leftside
    or rightside flags (the checkboxes, either in the classes panel or in the kerning
    assistance dialog) correctly? Just a guess. But -- to my knowledge -- the warning
    appeals to duplicate class names. (I had this myself last week, and it took me
    some time to find the class.)"

  body: "That redefined warning comes up when there are two sets of classes (or duplicate
    classes). If you imported your features, you may have also imported a set of classes
    with the features. (The default in FLS5 is to included classes in the feature
    code) Look in the features panel and see if there are classes listed in the lower
    right hand panel (under the panel that contains the feature text). If it is there
    delete it. Then recompie with your original classes.\r\n\r\nJames"
