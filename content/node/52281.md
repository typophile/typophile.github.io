    you'll see all the options you need.

  body: Just as an outsider providing a personal opinion - and who views PDFs of all
    different types for countless different reasons - I absolutely cannot stand when
    I've received a pdf that hijacks my computer and automatically opens in full screen
    because invariably I then have to find my keyboard, hit "esc" and hope I don't
    spill anything in the process. Not to mention I'm too lazy to see if there's a
    way I could prevent these things from automatically taking over my screen. That's
    just my two cents, which in today's market is worth more like slightly under a
    penny. I would just suggest taking into consideration how some might react to
    having their screen all but taken over by any potential presentations you're attempting
    to ... um ... present.

    as well as) systemwide which application will be used with certain file types.\r\nIn
    your case. Select a PDF in the Finder. Open its info panel (Command-I). \r\nChange
    the default program in the \u201COpen with\" drop-down. Click \u201CChange All\u2026\u201D.\r\n\r\nEasy
    peasy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTOH Preview is a far better behaving program when you need
    to print your PDF. Acrobats dialogs are hidden in a maze of possibilities.\r\n\r\n.

  body: "I make it a practice to have multiple PDF viewers because, especially when
    dealing with Linux-using clients you need to see how a PDF will render in multiple
    programs.  It's almost like browser wars for a while there, some didn't support
    transparency, some didn't show certain effects.\r\n\r\nI'm typically not a big
    fan of proprietary solutions that give the creator all of the power and not the
    user.  Like you called it, it is <em>hijacking</em> and if your first impression
    of a file is a bad one, that really sets the mood for the whole thing.\r\n\r\nIt's
    like when you go to a horrible flash website and their stupid ambient techno loop
    clashes with your beautiful Nine Inch Nails playing in iTunes and you end up having
    to pause your wonderful song because they didn't have the knowledge or foresight
    to put a <em>mute music</em> button on the site.\r\n\r\nA solution I would consider
    if I was putting a PDF online or sending to multiple users instead of presenting
    on my own machine, is to save the PDF as normal and give them advanced warning.
    \ As much as I hate splash pages, it would be far more courteous to have a splash
    page that said something like, <em>This project is designed to look best when
    viewed fullscreen.  Press <strong>Control-L</strong> or <strong>Command-L</strong>
    to enter fullscreen and press <strong>esc</strong> to return to your desktop.
    \ Enjoy!</em>"

  body: You could add a button on the first page so the user could choose to open
    the PDF full screen. If they don't click it, it stays in whatever view you defined
    in the document properties. Then on the last page, you'd put another button to
    drop out of full screen mode. See http://typophile.com/node/40961 for info on
    how to create buttons with actions.
