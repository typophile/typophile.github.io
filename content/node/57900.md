    stocks with a uniform quality. Laser does not.\r\n2.) Consistency is a matter
    of choice I find Illustrator as the final assembly software provides the maximum
    opportunity, especially as it is very compatible with the PDF format which you
    will no doubt need.\r\n3.) Choose either Epson or HP the two is a matter of size
    and price range for you. Some Epsons can print on CD/DVD's also.\r\n4.) I do not
    know, but seldom recommend Online Printers. The best Customer service will be
    you best choice if this is your first time.\r\n5.) Not really, you should be able
    to customize your showing based on the audience. Page numbers/folios are not useful
    for this approach.\r\n6.) In a sturdy case or case binding. (Post binding is flexible)\r\n7.)
    Helvetica is notoriously bad (difficult to read) with light weights in small sizes...
    it will all depend on size. This is an opportunity for you to form an opinion.
    Let me know what you settle on.\r\n8.) At your age 4 times a year, as you get
    older you'll do it less. I promise.\r\n9.) Prepare your files at 300 dpi for many
    applications, however the inkjet printers often do a good job with less.\r\n10.)
    A sentence will suffice. Practice your speaking points for interviews to extend
    past that.\r\n11.) These days an address is less valuable. Keep it digital. Phone
    and e-mail.\r\nI have strong opinions that a card is inappropriate (for a student
    seeking employment). However, as a freelance designer the card is the ideal format
    for such contact info.\r\n\r\nThese are a lot of questions I hope I'm helpful.
    I'm trying to be nice, but I'm so old and challenged.\r\n\r\nAll the best.\r\n\r\nRG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    nd of the stick.\r\nProbably sending it out is cheaper if it's a lot of ink.\r\nThe
    printer is ok...the printers at the apple store are a good guide for designers.
    This may not handle graphics well...It could be a business machine.\r\n\r\nFine
    type choices...you'll find it's all a matter of taste.\r\n\r\nRG"

    the colors will be screwed up.\r\n2. Photoshop\u2019s native file format.\r\n3.
    No. Don\u2019t print a portfolio on anything under $500 if you want to be taken
    seriously. \r\n4. -\r\n5. Your portfolio should be customizable so you can show
    more relevant work for each job, so leave page numbers out to save time when rearranging.\r\n6.
    In the format preferred by the managers of each employer. Find out what they like
    from someone else. Personally I use a $5.99 Muji plastic photo presentation album.
    People who don\u2019t like it can kiss my ass, and people who know what it is
    adore me for buying Muji.\r\n7. Yes, but use Neue Helvetica to look smart.\r\n8.
    However often you have new work with using.\r\n9. 300 DPI is fine, although if
    you have really amazing photographs and a 1200 DPI printer it won\u2019t hurt
    to print at 1200 DPI. \r\n10. Don\u2019t provide extensive detail unless you know
    that the job has very few applicants. In this economy design jobs get hundreds
    of applicants, and nobody has time to read long explanations. You can use longer
    explanations in print than online\u2014I have had several people tell me they
    did not like the amount of text on my web site and so I cut back.\r\n11. The URL
    of your online portfolio (you need a real URL, deviantart etc. are NOT professional!),
    email address, phone number, and permanent mailing address."

  body: "That\u2019s not the kind of work that\u2019s going to land you commercial
    jobs because most people aren't going to be interested in your technical experiments
    regardless of quality. Do a series of flyers and posters to go with the dance
    buttons and you might be able to land some work for bands and djs. The don't pay
    much (if at all), but it will let you build up a portfolio of actual commercial
    work and they might recommend you to people who will pay you.\r\n\r\nIt could
    work for getting into a school, however, because an admissions counselor might
    be impressed that you are experimenting with color theory and composition of your
    own volition, something art students tend to grouse about all freshman year."

    are thinking of sending out flyers to prospective employers? If so, I think you
    will be throwing your money away. That type of advertising almost never works.
    The best way to get a job is to go door to door, introduce yourself, and ask if
    there is a possibility of making an appointment to show your portfolio to the
    person who does the hiring. Fifty visits of this type will be more productive
    than 250 flyers mailed out, or dropped off at places."
