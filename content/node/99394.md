  body: "Sorry don't know this typeface but, as most of time for Kellerhouse Inc.,
    it could be a custom job.\r\nHere is now a list of base fonts to base the customization
    on: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mendoza-vergara/proteina/|Proteina]] (/M off
    and needs to add a leg to /G), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/capearcona/ca-geheimagent/|CA
    Geheimagent]] (same job as Proteina but globally a bit more off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/raleigh-gothic/|Raleigh
    Gothic]] (too much condensed), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dizajndesign/komu/|Komu
    A]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hipopotam/olifant/|Olifant]]"

      custom deal.\r\n\r\nI imagine that it's probably not a handset but that's always
      a possibility.\r\n\r\nThe fonts that you recommended are strikingly similar,
      thanks so much for those!\r\n\r\nI know the name of the guy that designed these
      posters at Kellerhouse, I might work up the nerve to ask him."

    drop some lines here.\r\nNote also that, on the Gomorrah poster, \"A FILM BY MATTEO
    GARRONE\" looks set with the same typeface but less condensed. That could give
    credit to a 2-styled bespoke typeface: \"Normal\" and Condensed (with a bit of
    customization on /G for big titles)"

  body: "I ended up asking the staff designer that did these posters about the typeface.\r\n\r\nIt
    turns out that it's taken from a book called <a class=\"freelinking external\"
    href=\"http://www.redstonepress.co.uk/abz.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">ABZ: Alphabets
    and Other Signs</a> that displays mostly oddball typography.\r\n\r\nThe designer
    said that there is no existing vector or digital version of the font.\r\n\r\nBelow
    is from what I'm assuming the above typeface is based on, it's from page 148 of
    ABZ.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/1453/abzb.jpg\">\r\n\r\nLooking
    further and now knowing that this italic is soviet Czech, I think that it and
    <a class=\"freelinking external\" href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dizajndesign/komu/a/\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">Komu A</a> have a similar design origin.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n<img
    src=\"http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/6964/abz103.jpg\">\r\n\r\nI found this
    on page 103 of ABZ, the table of contents identifies it as being from a signwriter's
    handbook called <a class=\"freelinking external\" href=\"http://cargocollective.com/Central_Station/Pismo-a-Jeho-Konstrukce-1950s-Czech-Typography\"
    rel=\"nofollow\">P\xEDsmo a Jeho Konstrukce</a> (transl. 'The Font and Its Construction'),
    by Richard P\xEDpal, 1956."
