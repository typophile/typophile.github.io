  in rural Western New York called us up here at the Cary Collection. She found a
  machine in a garage, and thought it might be a piece of printing equipment. The
  previous owner of the house used to work at Kodak. It was hard to describe over
  the phone, so we sent one of our student assistants on a road trip to take pictures.\r\n\r\nThe
  machine is in pieces, but you can see it has a keyboard, and a cluster of wheels/gears
  with letters. Any chance someone out there might have an idea what this thing might
  do? We can't figure it out.\r\n\r\nThe pictures are here: http://wally.rit.edu/cary/mystery_machine/mystery_machine.html\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be appreciated! :)"

  body: "Mystery solved: the machine is a \"Graphotype.\" \r\n\r\nThe Graphotype was
    used to stamp rows of type into small metal plates. Then, you could print from
    the plates with an Addressograph machine. For example, you could use the Graphotype
    to set plates for all the names and addresses on your mailing list. Then, you
    could print all your envelopes with the Addressograph.\r\n\r\nThe Graphotype was
    also used to make dog tags!\r\n\r\nEvidently, there are many of these, and as
    with anything these days, you can find them on eBay.\r\n\r\nMore pictures and
    information here: http://www.dogtagsrus.com/addressograph%20graphotype.htm"

  body: "Yes indeed, Marnie is 100% correct - the machine in the photo is an Addressograph
    Graphotype.  The model in the photo is either an 6340 (emobsser)((characters raised
    as on a credit card)) or a 6341 (debosser)((characters indented in like on a dog
    tag)).  \r\n\r\nThis machine has seen better days.  It is missing key parts and
    would cost a fortune to rebuild.  It appears that this machine is destin for the
    scrap yard - it is such a shame - these machines are great that is why we collect
    them and preserve them.  This machine would have been made between 1926 and the
    mid 1960's.  Currently we have 14 project machines and they can be reviewed at
    http://www.dogtagsrus.com/projects.htm  \r\n\r\nThe Graphotype is made of cast
    iron and as such the 6300 class machines weigh about 390 lbs. each.  The machines
    ran on a 1/4 hp 110 Vac motor.  As delivered from the factory the machine would
    have had a clipboard to hold copy and a work light for the operator.  The original
    factory color would have been either black, a real funky dark green or grey.  \r\n\r\nThe
    Graphotype was a support machine that made the plates that were used by the Addressograph
    for addressing documents.  In the early 1940's the military adopted the Graphotype
    to make dog tags.\r\n\r\nThe Graphotype is a machine that shaped our nation but
    alass the computer has religated them to the local land fills and scrap yards.
    \ At present you can pick up almost any newspaper in a large city and you will
    find in the obituaries that someone was at one time or another an addressograph
    operator . . . it is so sad to see the machine in this photo in such a state of
    disrepair it makes me think of all the stories that machine might hold of the
    people that used it.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to review more information about these
    machines you can visit: http://www.dogtagsrus.com and click on the history and
    information section.  We are constantly updating our information and are always
    seeking information and photographs of Addressograph Graphotype machines.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have ANY information on ANY graphotype machines, new, old, forsale, in a colletion,
    in a dump or where ever or you may have photos of these machines you may contact
    me direct at tagtech@dogtagsrus.com\r\n\r\nThank You\r\nKobie   "
