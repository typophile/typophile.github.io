		<div class="commentbody">I don't recall if any of this was already mentioned in this  <BR>thread, but . . . <BR> <BR>There were several Caslons produced by all of the  <BR>major foundries. This particular cut traces its lineage in  <BR>this country back to the Old Style of Philadelphia  <BR>typefounder Laurence Johnson. Legend has it that in  <BR>1858 he arranged with Wm. Caslon's successors to  <BR>duplicate the Caslon fonts in this country. Accounts  <BR>vary about whether he obtained original matrices,  <BR>unfinished strikes, or freshly cast fonts from which he  <BR>made electrotyped matrices.  <BR> <BR>Johnson later merged into MacKellar, Smiths &amp; Jordan,  <BR>which in turn became part of the American Type  <BR>Founders Company. ATF re-released the Caslon fonts  <BR>under the name Caslon Oldstyle No. 471. This is the  <BR>face that Linotype used as a model for their Caslon Old  <BR>Face (note: <i>not</i> Old <i>Style</i>), which is what your sample is  <BR>set in. <BR> <BR>The uneven baseline and x-height &ndash; look at that  <BR><i>v, w,</i> &amp; <i>x</i>! &ndash; are presumably carried over from the  <BR>original, rough hand-cutting by Wm. Caslon himself.  <BR>These effects are seen in the ATF foundry type, though  <BR>perhaps to a slightly differing degree. If Johnson  <BR>created his own mats from either unfinished strikes or  <BR>by electrotyping, then some of the unevenness could  <BR>have been introduced at that point.  <BR> <BR>Some of the bounce in this sample, however, may  <BR>be unique to this setting somehow. That excitable <i>u</i>  <BR>is not to be seen quite so jumpy in Lino samples that  <BR>I have. <BR> <BR>Note that the Linotype cutting has slightly different  <BR>vertical proportions, most notably in the shortened  <BR>descenders, to accommodate Lino's standard  <BR>alignment.  <BR> <BR>&ndash; K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have a copy of the 1924 Caslon Co. specimen, which is interesting and may be instructively compared to the original 18th Century specimen. The marketing spiel in the 1924 version makes a big deal about the types being 'cast entirely from matrices produced from the original punches engraved in the early part of the 18th Century'. What is interesting about this claim is that it doesn't note that the alignment, spacing and finishing of the matrices was much refined during the intervening 200 years. I don't have a photo of the 18th C. specimen, or the 19th C. specimen produced by Wm Caslon III &ndash; which I do own &ndash;, but here is a close up from the 1924 specimen (14pt, but the same observations can be made about other sizes). <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/11889.jpg" alt="Caslon Old Face 1924&#44; 14pt"> <BR> <BR>If you compare this image to the Linotype Caslon picture provided by William Berkson, above, you will see that the vertical alignment in the Caslon 1924 version is much better. The Linotype version looks like it has emulated the worst aspects of the 18th Century type, presumably in an attempt to be authentic. Personally, I think the 1924 Caslon specimen shows the Old Face types (and also some of the big types and blackletters) at their very best: the result not of the fetishisation of the original, but of 200 years of proprietorial familiarity with a design that the firm was not afraid to improve. The conceit of the specimen pages is also delightful: re-settings of famous English books, e.g. the first folio edition of Shakespeare's plays, showing how much better they would have looked if set in Caslon Old Face.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, <BR> <BR>You point to small types. I am in agreement and I am happy to see you on my side wanting optical scaling to be included in Open Type. <BR> <BR>On the matter of absorbant papers however. I am not sure which ones you are speaking of. Most print very crisp. <BR> <BR>But if you mean papers that tend to &quot;wick&quot; that is different problem. Sometimes a good ink, or doctoring, could over come that for you. If not, a different stock serves better than a bigger aspirin.  <BR> <BR>My point was we should not be &quot;imitating results&quot; such as the one you mentioned. Too much time could be spent trying to overcome one specific problem. After all there are many different papers, inks not to mention printers. Which ones do we imitate? Which problems do we attempt to solve. <BR> <BR>I realize there are some that think a car looks more beautiful after a crash than when it came from the showroom, hopefully there are very few of them. <BR> <BR>Also I realize there are font companies specializing in fonts for differenct kinds of printing processes, and papers. David Burlow's for example. That, however, is highly specialized work, and from the reports I have, the fonts are all for one family of paper, &quot;newsprint&quot;. <BR> <BR>Imagine were we to follow that example for all known papers, with all fonts in the existing libraries. There would be more fonts than locusts in China. <BR> <BR>So if we are to imitate, or indulge in prophecy of circumstances we will certainly be busy doing very little creative work. I'd rather tend shovel bull manure. <BR> <BR>John <BR> <BR>The showing of your Caslon specimen is over inked, as such, will hide some of the &quot;fetishisation&quot; of which you speak. You are correct that both the Linotype, and Lanston cuttings were based on an &quot;earlier&quot;, Caslon &quot;state&quot;. Also, importantly &quot;a smaller point size&quot;. A smaller point size is a big consideration when cutting punches. The smaller the size, the more emphasized the imperfections when blown up. The new &quot;state&quot; of the Caslon foundery did not eliminate those imperfections other than perhaps re-aligning, tightening, and making more upright the characters. <BR> <BR>The bigger actual hot metal pt. size the smoother it &quot;should look&quot; when cut by a hand punchcutter. <BR> <BR>So some of the smoothosity is due to working scale. <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR>P.S. Sorry for any errors, there is pressure to free up this machine.</div>

Because of the overinking on your sample I can't compare the variation in color of the letters that Hrant pointed to as a main feature of my sample. <BR> <BR>The hypothesis I am pursuing is that digital type has gone too far in uniformity - particularly of color and tightness of fit. Caslon is an apt place to test the hypothesis, because it is obviously less uniform than most faces, yet one of the most used and returned to over the centuries.  <BR> <BR>Is the looser fit of my sample, which Giampa interestingly says is a feature of limitations of the Linotype machine, a good thing for readibility? The answer isn't obvious to me.  <BR> <BR>I think it is also an interesting question whether cap height being lower than ascender height - a principle I believe of Morrison - is actually sound. Sure, it does result in less uniformity of color to have full height caps. And I can see that in German this would be distracting, as all nouns are in caps. But in English it may be a nice relief and marker to the eye as a beginning of sentences. (Adobe Caslon does preserve the full size caps.) <BR> <BR>Overall, I want to get to the library to see more old samples - but if some people can post more that would be great.  <BR> <BR>   <BR></div>

I have become uncomfortable with both the Lanston Caslon and Justin Howes' Founders Caslon &ndash; although acknowleding the former's particular usefulness for letterpress printing from polymer plates &ndash; since discovering the refitted, realigned Caslon in the 1924 specimen. I understand the historical interest embodied in fonts based on the 18th Century originals, but the Caslon Co. refit was so much of an improvement that what I would really like to see is a digital revival of the 1924 version. I think this would be a more <i>useful</i> thing to have.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;the Caslon Challenge <BR>Let me understand: The bulk of the text was <BR>printed from digital direct to film, then  <BR>offset, and the other was letterpress from  <BR>monotype metal type to paper? <BR> <BR>&gt;a digital revival of the 1924 version  <BR>How would this be different from Adobe Caslon? When I typed Adobe Caslon over your sample, at the same size, the spacing matched and the letter forms were very close. The main difference seems to be the greater weight due to ink spread. The Linotype Caslon Old Face to my eye has significant differences in letter form from either. The spacing is also looser. I don't know about Langston's Caslon 337 by comparison. I think Founders Caslon 12 is of limited use because it imitates the random clumps of ink of the 18th century, before Baskerville and others used better inks. This will always have a forced antique look.  <BR> <BR>But using some of the irregularities of the original is to me an open different question.Here is my late Uncle Ben Lieberman writing about Caslon in 'Types of Typefaces' (1968):  <BR> <BR>&quot;The typeface which Caslon introduced in 1734 was an instant success, and except for one brief period in the 19th century has remained popular ever since, yet it is perhaps the most controversial face in history. Some persons consider it the greatest type ever (they have popularized a motto &quot;When in doubt, use Caslon&quot;) and other think it overrated, a collection of mistakes, elusively out of keeping with everything. But - it works, is hightly readable, alive, with warmth and open dignity that has no pretense whatsoever. Caslon is the prime example of a face in which the individual letters are nothing, but the total effect is strong and honest.&quot; <BR> <BR>From this thread, it looks like the controversy is not about to go away. But I don't see Adobe Caslon used that much. And I suspect that isn't just changing fashion, but that somehow it misses that elusive something that has made Caslon so successful in past times.   <BR> <BR>  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>1) Are you suggesting a new digital Caslon should be based on the Caslon 1924 re-fitting?</i> <BR> <BR>I'm saying that I would find such a typeface more immediately and more broadly useful than any of the current digital Caslons. Sadly, Adobe Caslon is the only version that is suited to a wide range of typographic application, but it doesn't look like Caslon, so what's the point? <BR> <BR><i>2) Are you suggesting it should be based on the overinked specimen sheet, or based the lead types which could be easily found? </i> <BR> <BR>I would like to have two versions: one for letterpress printing from polymer, and one for offset printing, but NOT because the latter should reproduce overinking or ink gain/smear. Letterpress printing puts a bite into the surface of the page, which somehow makes the type seem more <i>there</i>. Offset printing is very often too light, underinked, and ends up looking grey and unconvincing. In letterpress, the ink is pressed into the fibres of the paper; in offset, very often, the paper actually affects the colour of the type, which is not dense enough and does not penetrate enough. Robert Reid told me he often has the impression that offset printed text could be blown off the page by a gust of wind. <BR> <BR>I think types printed offset often benefit from being slightly heavier than that used for letterpress printing. I don't think this is really about ink gain/smear, as some people have suggested, but simply about the way in which the ink and the letterform interract with the paper in the two different technologies. <BR> <BR>Note also that I adjusted the contrast on the photo because it was rather dark, so this might affect the impression that the specimen is overinked. Unfortunately, looking at photographs of type is no substitute for looking at the real thing. <BR> <BR><i>3) Are you suggesting it should be based on &quot;14. pt as you have illustrated? </i> <BR> <BR>Well, ideally we would have a different font for each size. This is especially true for Caslon, who varied his forms considerably between sizes; much more than, say, Bodoni, who seems to have followed a fairly linear pattern <BR> <BR><i>4) Do you remember the Caslon Challenge? </i> <BR> <BR>I do, although not well enough to make a guess <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>It should be noted that none of my thoughts are intended to suggest any kind of absolute rule or preference. I have no doubt at all that a skilled printer can make even the lightest digital Caslon (probably 337) look good even in offset. I am very conscious, however, that quality book typography and printing is a small proportion of the typesetting and printing that happens in the world, and I would like to have a Caslon that could take some abuse and still come out readable. Apart from offset printing, there are webpress, laser and inkjet systems, etc., and I'm not refering to office and home printers but to large scale commercial printing devices.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm saying that extra weight that might benefit a type in offset printing does not need to be based on ink gain in letterpress printing. Why should it? Modern types designed for the principal modern printing technologies, not based on historical models and not in any sense revivals, also benefit from being heavier than letterpress types. It would be perverse to approach such design from the perspective of trying to imagine what a letterpress version of such a typeface might look like if printed with a bit too much ink. Since you're so fond of saying, Hrant, that type design should be based on how people read not on how they used to write, you might agree that types should be designed for how people print not how they used to print.</div>
