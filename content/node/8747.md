  body: Christine, the way this forum works is that you show us the image of the lettering
    you want us to identify &#40;in .gif or .jpg format, or on a web site&#41;, and
    then we see if we can tell you what font was used. There have been many editions
    of the Sound of Music that have been issued on posters, video &amp; DVD, so we
    cannot know which one you want identified. <BR> <BR>Remember that the movie came
    out about 20 years before there was anything like the current digital fonts, and
    in the 60&#39;s  poster lettering was done using photo type, or hand lettering
    in most cases. <BR> <BR>In other words, the poster lettering may never have been
    digitized as a font. &#40;Just to prepare you to possibly be frustrated.&#41;

  body: Yes, that helps. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s hand-drawn lettering, somewhat in the style
    of Ed Benguiat, but not as interlocked as the new House <a href="http://www.houseind.com/house.php?kit=EDFONT-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank">Interlock</a> font in their Benguiat set. <BR> <BR>Treacyfaces
    has shown some new fonts called Toreador, Safari and Picador, that seem to be
    based on the same stylistic look as the movie poster lettering, but their web
    site doesn&#39;t show them yet. I have only seen a sample of these in print ads
    that show very few letters. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t think of any other fonts right
    now that have much of this feel other than some of <a href="http://members.aol.com/fontner/frontpage.html"
    target="_blank">Harold&#39;s Fonts</a> called Denney One &amp; Two and Ben&#39;s
    Gothic. Both are a bit &#39;rougher&#39; than your poster lettering.

  body: Thank you for your help Mike, those fonts do look very similar. I guess i&#39;ll
    just have to make up a bit of a composite of all of them! <BR> <BR>Christine
