body: Just a quickie. The printers are having a bit of trouble trying to output this
  business card of mine. Everything rips all right, except for the gradient strokes.
  they show up on my pdf, they show up on the printers pdf, but drop out when it rips
  on their imagesetter. The file was created in indesign cs. Anyone had this problem?
  would outlining the strokes help?  <BR> <BR>Below are two picks, left is the upper
  half of the card, right is a close up in Indy. <BR> <BR>cheers, kris. <BR> <BR><img

  body: In some instances, you need to flatten the artwork for older RIPs to be able
    to process it. Isn&#39;t there a tickbox that says something like &#34;compatible
    gradients&#34;?

    an image now, can you mr rip?

  body: Check the overprint setting of the gradient stroke. A thing that I forgot
    once when I was new to indy.

  body: simple. <BR> <BR>Convert the stroke to an actual box. this will give you a
    lot less problems with different rips. <BR>Gradient strokes are a fairly new thing.

  body: Thanks guys. I did just that Kyle, converted the stroke to a box. I noticed
    that the eps was showing a 0pt stroke. I hope it works!

  body: I agree, rasterize that SOB at 1200 PPI. Why so high? Because it&#39;s outrageous.
