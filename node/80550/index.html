		<div class="commentbody">Condensed fonts were basically essential in the pre-smart-phone era, as the displays were small, had coarse dpi&rsquo;s and you wanted to cram as much UI or text message on the screen as possible. As we move beyond that era the condensed fonts are starting to feel clunky. So as much as I love the old font, the new one makes sense for high res phones with plenty of screen real estate.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The comparison on the DaltonMaag site is unfair. It only shows one of the Condensed weights. Nokia is a big family, including a Wide version (made by Jelle Bosma at Monotype) which is far less explicit but therefore perfectly suited to being used on UIs. Nokia Serif doesn’t even get a mention at all. Seems that Nokia never used it. That puts them far behind cleverer companies who realize that they need more typographic expression across all media than offered by 3 weights of a generic Sans.</p>
<p>I have posted a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PDF<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on my blog that contains an early (2002) presentation of the complete family, with some comments by me about the shortcomings of these early pre-release fonts.</p>
<p>Either the communication and marketing people at Nokia didn’t bother to look at what they had (it seems that they change personnel very often, losing knowledge with every generation) or Bruno Maag’s selling talent won the day. It would have been a much better idea to look at the existing fonts, analyze them from a branding and technical point of view and then bring them into the present. Ten years is a long time for any technology, including fonts, but there is no reason why old benefits could not be combined with new requirements. Technically, Nokia Pure is a great typeface, as everything is that DaltonMaag produce, but it won’t be half as memorable as the good old Nokia Sans and Serif were.</p>
<p>Designing fonts for brands needs a combination of technical and branding know-how and this time the engineers seem to have won. Unless, of course, Nokia deliberately wants to be as bland as Microsoft.</p>

As a first impression they seem much more suitable for Nokias external communication needs, and a &ldquo;bland&rdquo; typeface can do one heck of a job in a busy context.

A complete family of faces for a brand will include simpler versions as well that may have to work in an Office environment. We’ve done versions of Bosch Sans and DB Sans (exclusive for Deutsche Bahn, German Railways) to the widths of Arial (which is fitted to Helvetica widths) so text wouldn’t re-run in documents that don’t have the original font installed. Those are compromises and may look less than perfect, but this is what we do to make things work. But this doesn’t mean that all the members of an exclusive family of faces for a big brand have to be faceless (pardon the pun). All our recent families have included Sans and Serif, normal and condensed, even wide and compressed. They all share certain features and belong together, not like twins but like sisters, brothers, nieces and nephews. Designing one corporate typeface is so 80s and betrays a design philosophy that aims for uniformity and is hardly adequate for today’s media requirements. Wo wants to read a printed annual report in the light weight of geometric sans? Or tight spreadsheets in a generous serif? A brand needs to express all its communication in the appropriate visual voice. And type is visual language that needs to whisper, shout, sing and murmur, wherever necessary.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I thought Nokia Sans looked good on recent Nokia touch devices but the phones themselves failed to conquer the market. It looks obvious Nokia are trying to distance themselves from the past in an attempt to seem contemporary.</p>
<p>Do all brands need to be timeless? Is it wrong to rebrand every decade? For a quick-changing industry that barely existed 25 years ago, a strong identity that was for some time omnipresent and well recognized might be keeping the associations the public has with the brand to a certain popular technology that now is a decade old. 
Perhaps, had Erik&rsquo;s typeface had less character, the association the brand has with the now &lsquo;old&rsquo; type of phones would not be so strong and the font could stay.</p>
<p>If you look at Nokia history it would seem absurd for them to use their branding from the time they were selling rubber and paper. Five years old Nokia phones are now this: Nokia rubber.</p>
<p>Nokia is trying to rebrand quite desperately, and understandably so. Just to think that 4 years ago Nokia E61 was the ultimate &lsquo;internet phone&rsquo;—this alone brings a smile on my face.
The game has changed and they want to convince everyone they&rsquo;re still on top of it. They want to cut the associations with the technology now seen as obsolete.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola on the other hand—back when Nokia produced paper—sold sugar water. Now, Coca-Cola sells sugar water. They are more of the type of company that could do with a &lsquo;timeless&rsquo; brand.</p>
<p>Is it me or… Doesn&rsquo;t Dalton Maag&rsquo;s press release look a tad ironic with the rotisesque Stroudley they use on their website?</p>
<p>Quick, somebody tell them their brand looks dated!</p>

<p>That is the best explanation I’ve seen so far. They may need a new brand, but does it have to be based on a bland typeface to be successful? As someone else suggested: why not go with Segoe and slip under Microsoft’s big wings?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Trevor – true, using a Frutigeresque humanist sans worked for Apple, but that was 10 years ago. Pure is very much in the same genre as Myriad. So, now, Nokia shares a look established long ago by one of its competitors and departs only slightly from their overlords at Microsoft (Segoe). It doesn&rsquo;t have its own identity – which is maybe fitting for the road it&rsquo;s traveling.</div>

Trying to define what is &lsquo;bland&rsquo; or not is purely a snotty subjective exercise anyway. Personally, I&rsquo;ve yet to see a single typeface from you (Erik) that I find remotely attractive. Not because they are bland or &lsquo;un-bland&rsquo;, but because your aesthetic in typography just doesn&rsquo;t really sit well with me. Just like some fashion-designer&rsquo;s stuff, or artist&rsquo;s paintings&hellip; etc.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->something more quirky in Adobe Clean<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Putting more Gill into Myriad and cutting bits off the ends qualifies as quirky? Pretty lame, considering Adobe’s history and typographic talent still in the building. Seems another occasion where some art director or brand person wanted something a little “different” but not too original, lest that might test badly in focus groups.</p>
<p>And, @typodermic: 
I never signed anything with Nokia. I supplied very rough outlines for a few weights with incomplete character sets which were turned into complete fonts by Jelle Bosma at Monotype. I suppose I could go back to the original sketches and make a new typeface, although some people here would find that one old-fashioned and tired. So far, however, all my designs from the late 80s (like FF Meta and ITC Officina) are still selling quite well. But then again, life is probably too short to warm up old ideas. I’d rather work on new ones.</p>
