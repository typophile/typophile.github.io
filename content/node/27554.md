body: "for any InDesign users:\r\n\r\nThis is simply to satisfy my curiosity, but
  does anyone know the pattern of ID's spell check? Unlike most programs that start
  at the beginning and end at the end, ID spell check seems to jump all over the place
  and start and end arbitrarily. \r\n\r\nThere is a heated debate about this in my
  office and no one has any good conclusion!\r\n\r\n"

    for spell checking matter, wouldn't it be better to use a word processor?"

    on AFAIK.

  body: as Miss Tiffany said, it begins at your cusor or active page. the "jumping
    around" that you describe is the result of the stacking order of elements on the
    page. when checking an entire document the app doesn't move from one text frame
    or story to the next by left-to-right, top-to-bottom as a reader might. in my
    observations, it moves from top to bottom in the stacking order on the page.
