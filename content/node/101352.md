  body: 'I know of no such font, but for what its worth I compared the pairs of  ''a'',
    ''i'', ''u'' and ''l'' glyphs and allowing for the low resolution of the image,
    they seem identical and so are the two verticals of the ''H''. So it is either
    a superb piece of lettering (in the sense of graphic consistency) or its a font.  The
    method I used to compare them was to fuse the letter pairs visually using a ''cross-eye''  technique,
    one used in viewing stereoscopic pairs of images: hold a pencil point halfway
    between the two glyphs and while staring at it bring it towards your nose until
    the two images ''click'' together. Or simply comare using photoshop layers!'
