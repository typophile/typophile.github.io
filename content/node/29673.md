  use of scripts, languages, etc) of [[OpenType]] might be very useful. It could explain
  which tags have current application support, discussions of implementation, all
  sorts of things.\r\n\r\n1) Is there one already?\r\n\r\n2) If not, is there interest
  in one?"

    If such a site exists already, I'd love to hear about it.\r\n\r\nNo, I haven't
    looked very hard."

  body: i've started a little bit in our [[typowiki]] with [[ot_how-to]]. i've been
    wanting to expand on this, but haven't had the time to yet. but i don't see why
    we can't use our own wiki for this.

    OpenType mail list.

  body: "The Typophile.com wiki could be the best place for a full-featured reference
    of OpenType mechanics. In its current shape it is a whos who of type and a really
    great area for primers on many fields.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why I think it might
    do well in its own space are  somewhat complicated, but I'll try and explain.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I would like to see is a highly-interactive technical manual, meaning that the
    searching, categorizations and general feel is optimized for finding out what
    I want on a particular facet of OT. The Typowiki has a much rounder, more narrative
    feel, and is fully integrated as an accessory to the forums. The wiki results
    are returned with topic threads.\r\n\r\nI would like the OT wiki to be a neutral
    place. Building it inside the Typowiki would possibly force any contributors to
    feel like they had to be a 'part of the scene'. Or it might.\r\n\r\nI would like
    to see the data as open and as accessible as a Wikimedia Foundation project. In
    fact, more so than some of those are. I would like no one to 'own' the wiki, so
    to speak, and be able to fork it, archive it or whatever-they-like it.\r\n\r\nUptime.
    When Typophile is down is when I need the reference info the most, because I'm
    getting more work done! :)\r\n\r\nThere is some relational wiki technology that
    is not used here that I am considering, that would be particularly helpful to
    a spec-centric wiki, and I am intrigued by how that could help. In fact, most
    of it is still being developed, so I guess that is neither a pro or con.\r\n\r\n<A
