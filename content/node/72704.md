  and design agency starting with the logo. It's name is a composite of the german
  words 'netz' (means net) and 'elf' (means eleven and elf). Despite the latter has
  two meanings, 'elf' (the little guys with the long ears) is adequate.\r\n\r\nThinking
  about how to express an elf i only could find the ear as unique for it. As the sign
  will be used in very small sizes (12x12px) for icons and such it has to be quite
  simple. So heres my try (The tag line means 'agency for good image'):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_4404.png]\r\nAs
  this seems not \"eary\" enough to me i tried a little modification:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo4_3729.png]\r\nI
  would love to hear what you think of my attempts and if you like it :)\r\n\r\nDo
  you perhaps have some other ideas how to express an elf?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot,\r\nChristian"

  body: The nearness of the tz pair (and similarly the tu, ru in the subhead) is too
    tight. I appreciate that the spacing below is right, but I think you have to consider
    that those spots are distracting.

    blue flame of a gas stove. I'd assume that giving a quasi-monochrome pointy shape
    a striking resemblance to the tip of an elf's intricate ear is difficult if not
    impossible. What's probably true though is that pointy ears are what first comes
    to most peoples' mind first when thinking of elves.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can
    always go with the entire ear:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elfear_3978.png]\r\n\r\nHaha
    :P ... well at least I tried. I'll think hard and try to come up with something
    more useful.\r\n\r\nOne thing though: on my screen, the \"Agentur f\xFCr guten
    Eindruck\" looks flimsy at best. I don't mind the type, but screen display probably
    matters here, so maybe play around with that too."

  body: "Thanks for your comments :)\r\n\r\n@Miss Tiffany: Is it much to tight or
    just a bit? What you think of this a little more wide version (t<->z, t<->u, r<->u,
    t<->e)?:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo5_5626.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n@sebastian
    Thank you :) I asked around a lot what people see with that and - unfortunately
    - almost all did not see an ear (Mostly they thought it's a 1). But at least they
    saw the ear when they were told that it is one.\r\n\r\nThe problem with an entire
    isolated ear is that it's very hard to combine with an serious logo and it's shape
    is much more complex than just the tip what makes it complicated to optimize it
    for lower sizes. Also i don't have an idea of how to glue it togehther with the
    rest of the logo. BUT: When you have some fresh idea i would love to hear about
    it. \r\n\r\nThanks for your approach above - despite it might not yet be suitable
    for the logo i like it :)\r\n\r\nAbout the flimsyness of the tag line: Its font
    is the Continuum Light (The logo font is Continuum Medium with the right corner
    of the e rounded). I find the next weight Continuum Medium to fat (At least with
    it the elegance from the light one is lost):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo6_4049.png]\r\nAnd
    i'm not a very experienced type designer who could put just a little bit more
    weight on the light version without breaking it :("

  body: "The last version is better. A hair helped. And the bolder weight in the subhead
    helps, I think, as well. I might nudge 'tu' in 'Agentur' and 'gu' in 'guten' closer.
    And 'f\xFC' in 'f\xFCr' a little farther apart. Hmm... and the 'ru' in 'Eindruck'
    now feels a little loose. "
