body: "Here is a logo design I'm working on for a UK based clothing company \u2014
  <strong>Moti Bili</strong>. I'm told by the client that Moti Bili translate to <em>\"Fat
  Cat\"</em> (Arabic maybe?). Since it's a clothing company the symbol must be very
  simple as it will be printed at very small sizes (tags, etc...)\r\n\r\nI'm working
  on a few concepts at the moment, this one is probably the furthest along of any.
  I thought it would be a good time to get some feedback and suggestions. Right now
  I'm open to anything from what you see when you look at the symbol, to small tweaks
  (add to the <em>\"catness\"</em>), fonts, etc...\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!\r\nMike\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>UPDATED

    I think the space between the body and the tail is too little, and this makes
    the white space between not a good shape. I think the Gill is a good typeface
    for this."

    negative space looks like a highlight that would be on the glass \u2014 kind of
    like the kool-aid guy or something, haha.\r\n\r\nI also think the font needs some
    work, it wasn't necessarily slapped in there, but I didn't spend to much time
    perfecting it. I'm actually thinking of using something w/ a little bit more character...
    any suggestions? I wouldn't mind playing with the tracking and tightening it up
    a bit...\r\n\r\nOh, the font is Gotham by the way :)"

  body: "It's funny you made the kool-aid comment, that was the first thing that I
    saw. Well, not so much the kool-aid guy but a pitcher, with the space between
    the cat and the tail being a light spot. Maybe if the tail was to come out at
    the base of the logo, kind of like a backwards s? Maybe it's a personal thing
    for me, but although I love gotham, I feel it is used way to often. Maybe a slight
    tweak or one of the other suggestions would be a wise direction. Like I said though,
    maybe it's just me. I doubt the average consumer could tell gotham from any other
    geometric sans.\r\n\r\nI do have to say though, as soon as I saw the cat, I actually
    really liked the logo. I think tweaking the tail ill make it work."
