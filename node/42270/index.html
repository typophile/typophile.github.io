  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi there,
I'm doing a quick survey to ask, 'what was your first book about typography?' 
Particularly, which books were on your first year (freshman) university/college/apprenticeship reading list?  And which of these was the first that you bought, read, and referred to early on in your typographic education.

For me it was James Felici's Complete Manual of Typography.

No – understandably.

As a matter of interest, when you do offer the name of your first book, it would be great if, like Conor, you could offer a few words about its impact on you and your peers. 

Did many of your peers buy/read/borrow the same book? 
What was the general class consensus? 
Were you in a minority? 
Did it inspire you to read more? Or did it bring on a yawn?

		<div class="commentbody">I believe I bought both Bringhurst's <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em> and Craig's <em>Designing with Type</em> at the same time in the RISD bookstore, but I only take one with me wherever I go. Guess which one ;-) .

EDIT: Per Ryan's request, I'll make it more explicit. I had been into type for several months before buying Bringhurst, but as soon as I sat down with it, I knew I was passionate about what it detailed. Just one of those classics (if I can call it that after only two years). Craig was certainly not bad, but I read it after reading most of Bringhurst, and there wasn't too much new information in there. Some practical knowledge, though, and a better introduction to identifying common typefaces than Bringhurst.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In 1973, I had just gotten my journeyman's card as a hot-metal hand compositor. I had worked as an apprentice comp for 5 years. Though I had never read anything about "typography," I was excited about setting type for books. That summer I spent 5 weeks at the Vermont farm of the great type teacher Ray Nash. I read both volumes of Updike's "Printing Types" and talked with Ray and the handful of other students about what I had read.

When I had time I watched the Watergate hearings on TV.

Discovering the richness of typography in Updike made me go back to college, finish the final semester for a BA in English, and then commit to becoming a typographer. Here I yam, 35 years later.

I don't recall there being any typography books on the curriculum of my Foundation course or Dip.AD (Fine Art), in the early '70s in the UK. So "my" first book about typography actually belongs to my wife, who bought it when she was studying art at the University of Manitoba.

I've always been impressed with the asymmetric application of the price stickers, and their red bars which echo the bar on the dust jacket!

Since then, I've gotten a bunch from the library.  I'm still quite new to it all, though.


*I've loved type since I was a little kid - I'd pore over books from the library on "Circus Letters" and spend hours retraining my handwriting to be big or small or have two-story a's, etc.  But I didn't know other people liked this and kind of lost track of it until a few years ago.</div>

As a matter of interest: is anyone here still studying, or in some way in touch with current design students? Do you know what is being read Now by beginners? I spoke to a first year student last weekend who mentioned <cite>Type & Typography</cite>, by Baines & Haslam, <cite>About Face</cite> by David Jury and, obviously, one of Carson's books. 

<ul> <li>What are the main titles now being read by complete beginners?</li> <li>Perhaps <cite>Elements of Typographic Style</cite> is a bit heavy for a beginner, or do you disagree?</li> <li>Do you think many graphic design students read <cite>First Principles of Typography</cite> by Stanley Morison(?) or are such books now considered irrelevant by beginners?</li> </ul>

Back in the beginnings of my education, I always had the opinion that anything printed more than 10 years before wasn't worth reading!

It was a touchstone for me. When I was in school (not a very good design school) it was all backlash and '70s freedom. There was very little taught about classic geometry and structure. Everything was stagnant and the Mac was about to hit. Elements was the real deal—it had all the knowledge my teachers didn't have, which is exactly what I wanted. I think the book works as a read, but also a great reference. I still look things up in it all the time.</div>

It should be everyone’s first. Reading Kane cleared up all the confusion I was left with after reading the usual stuff. 

<cite>Perhaps Elements of Typographic Style is a bit heavy for a beginner, or do you disagree?</cite>

I tried reading it early on and was really confused as to why my professor wanted me reading all this pretentious nonsense that no editing department would ever go with. I often use it as a reference, particularly for terminology, but as a student I find the advice in it is usually too impractical to be of much real value. Professors who insist we read Bringhurst will usually see our work as boring, dated, or stuffy if we put the ideas into practice. And all three of my design jobs have explicitly stated not to follow Bringhurst.</div>

It was very interesting, but after that I needed something lighter - so my next was Stop Stealing Sheep.

Since then I have aquired and read quite a few books about Typography - some favourites:
Logo, Font & Lettering Bible - Leslie Cabarga
Counterpunch - Fred Smeijers
Designing Type - Karen Cheng

But the best bit is actually _working_ with fonts!

He's also the teacher who goes the most into logo conceptualization and design, so Cabarga's book was a big hit with him. He said he was contemplating using that book as the Design 101 textbook. I wouldn't have complained myself.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>EoTS</em> is definitely too heavy to just throw in a new student's lap. It should follow a more surface-level primer, so they at least have their footing first. That being said, when I did a brief bit of TA'ing and teaching, I recommended to my students that they sit down and read it, acknowledging that they would only understand about 50% of it, if that. Then, a year later, they should re-read it and they'd be surprised at how much more they understand and how much more they could analyze and consider the concepts. Every so often I return to Bringhurst (I've read it from front to back about 3 times, but dip into it regularly) as both a barometer and a refresher. I don't think I'll ever understand/use 100% of it, but I get more and more from it each time. This, to me, is what makes it such a valuable and practical tool.

Most of these books overlap with about 50% of their content, so I've found that finding the right book is often just as much as case of the quality of the text as it is the compatibility of the reader and the presentation.

Other books I've found useful are: Lupton's <em>Thinking With Type</em> and Felici's <em>Complete Manual of Typography</em>. Lupton delivers the message in a very digestible and skillful manner. She hits on the totality and reality of designing with type very well, whereas I like Felici's somewhat pedantic nature. It was great to have someone really get down to the nitty gritty and show blocks of type with different H&J settings (it's Quark 4.1-centric, which is now ironic, as it was published by Adobe). The further irony is that I really didn't like the typesetting in Felici's book. But I found the actual content to be very valuable at training my eye and mind to recognize subtle differences in set type.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Chris,
This is certainly not intended to sound rude, but it would be interesting to know just how many of your students <cite>really</cite> read <cite>'Elements'</cite> whilst still at university? And who fibbed and skipped to the end? 
Do you/have you ever encouraged self-expression in your typography classes?

A few years back, when I was at university, 'conventional' typography was seen as too academic and a lot of students -- myself included, initally -- just wanted to be creative without a planned, conventional approach (whoops!). 
I think my entire class wanted to be a Stanley Donwood, or a David Carson, rather than an unknown who communicated conventionally! 
However, maybe that was just my experience, and/or perhaps this has now changed – is rational fashionable?

Only after reading <em>Designing with Type</em> did I understand the major differences among different styles of type.

One of my friends recently expressed interest in typography after I critiqued her use of hyphens. I gave her <em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em> and <em>Thinking with Type</em>.

		<div class="commentbody">I suffered from poor craft skills during my Typography 1 course. Everything was done by hand there, and this caused me to severely dislike the course and the subject. 

Before I took my second semester of typography, I had a six-week course in stone-carving, for which the hand-lettering and carving was just more craft, which I did not excel at. However (God knows why…) I read <em>Elements</em> of my own accord concurrently. Bringhurst's prose (and his magical writing alone!) made me fall in love with type. I read the book quickly, in a feverish rush, from cover to cover (except for that weird chapter on page proportion). I was only 19.

I do not buy this rubbish that young students do not read. Those that do not I cannot take seriously! This is just the way it is… not everyone who studies graphic design is cut out for typography, which isn't a bad thing. I'm not particularly cut out for illustration myself either, for instance.

I know plenty of type and typography people who read. I've studied at four schools in three countries, and the students that were the most into type were always voracious readers. They read everything. In fact, we used to try to out do each other ("what, you read that? goddamit! what can I read next that'll be even more impressive?"). </div>

Maybe that's because typography and grids <strong>are</strong> pretty important. Typing, with fonts in a document, you are setting characters in a line. This line is spaced in relation to other lines. These multi-line blocks live in relation to their pages, and with other blocks, elements, images, etc.

Sounds like a grid to me ;-)</div>

Do you/have you ever encouraged self-expression in your typography classes?</em>

No offense taken, certainly. It's a good question. I imagine the number was low, as I was not the lead professor and was simply making a recommendation. <em>EoTS</em> was starting its first sweep through CMU's School of Design at the time. I was simultaneously TA'ing for a Graphic Design Fundamentals-style crash course and teaching 4 design apps in 4 weeks to incoming grad students. They were a very serious and committed bunch, though, so I'm sure most of them checked it out and those who did read it, really dug into it. Because it was simply my recommendation and not a real directive, I didn't bother to hold them to it in any way.

Because I've never really run my own type class in the full sense, I wasn't in a position to encourage self-expression. However, I strongly believe that it's far too easy to swing the pendulum to either side to the detriment of the other. Some of my favorite professors, Karen Berntsen and Karen Moyer (these are the two relevant to this topic, not my only favorites) had ingenious ways of encouraging creative problem solving over handing out stylistic specifics. CMU was very Swiss-centric when it came to style, but in many ways the onus for creativity and style was pretty much in the laps of the students. However, it was rock-solid for teaching problem solving and conceptual thinking.  If I were to teach, I would put students on three parallel paths, intersecting with a final project: 1) rules, conventions and standards; 2) free-form exploration and expression; 3) problem solving and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_thinking">lateral thinking</a>.

I think there's a way to emphasize all three approaches and keep students engaged. In the end, the professor needs to communicate a true passion for what they do, particularly because graphic design and typography are such a strange brew of pedantic rules and heady rule-breaking. This is why Lupton's book is a good first step, from my perspective. It's like a friendly conversation with a passionate practitioner, whereas reading Bringhurst is more like gaining access to the secret manuscripts of the Cult of Typography;* if you don't have some degree of passion and knowledge already, you'll quickly lose interest in the prose and minutiae and become overwhelmed. I'm sure this is why Bringhurst is not as appealing to longtime practitioners as well: much of that knowledge is not particularly novel to those who've experienced pre-digital type.

*Though they're certainly only secrets in the sense that most never think to seek them out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My first "type book" was <em>Le Ramat de la typographie</em> (sorry, no English translation, in a word, it's a technical book telling rules about where to place spaces and so on). Next followed Felici's <em>The Complete Manual of Typography</em>.

At University we were obligated to read Bringhurst's <em>The Elements of typography</em> (wich lead me to <em>A Short History of the Printed Word</em>) and Noordzij's <em>The Stroke</em> (wich lead me to <em>Letter Letter</em>). To be sure that we were reading them, our teacher asked us to do an oral presentation about the chapter of the week. I do like Bringhurst and do not find it difficult to read, but I must admit that I skipped <em>Appedix A:The Working Alphabet</em> (don't be rude to me, it's "just" a listing of glyphs!). 

Bringhurst and Noordzij are still in the corpus of the University.

Otherwise, I enjoyed <em>Making and breaking the grid</em>, <em>Grid Systems in Graphic Design</em>, <em>Dutch type</em>, <em>Couterpunch</em>, <em>Type now</em>, lots of Hyphen Press books and so on…</div>

Finland, but the books were bought in London. The school I went to had fairly limited amount of typography in its agenda, and we had our own material. There weren't a lot of books on type in Finnish then, not even now.
 
<cite>Did you find either of the books inspiring?
One more than the other?</cite>
I somehow found the Hudson a bit old fashioned (well, it was older), Type and Typography was more interesting. Getting really into typography took time, there were so many other aspects in design to learn, too.

<cite>Did you know what to look for in a book about typography after reading them?</cite>
Not really. I don't know if I should even admit this, but I only learned about Bringhurst from Typophile. After discovering this site my typografical library has grown a lot.

<cite>Sorry — so many questions.</cite>
That's ok :)</div>

That's quite acceptable that you learnt about Bringhurst's <cite> ‘Elements’</cite> on Typophile. I think the book is largely referenced in typographic circles, but I don't think I have ever seen it in a bookshop here in the UK. At least not since its original release. 

<strong>Chris</strong>
I agree, I think Lateral Thinking is absolutely crucial. Learning about past and current methodologies before using abstract concepts. I think students who have learnt convention in the first stages can't help being guided by it in the lateral thinking modules, because it makes sense. I think one benefit of lateral thinking, is that it serves to show the order and balance provided by well-practiced conventional design methods that the student has stepped away from (in the lateral thinking module).

<strong>Dan</strong>
I agree. Reading books/articles/other comes with the territory. Sure, not every graphic design student is cut out for studying typography, however, unfortunately, many of them want to practice it. I think if you sign up to design books, brochures, websites, newspapers, and visual identities or, in fact anything text-based it would be foolish to ignore the discoveries of the people who have laid the path for you -- to listen to what they have to say before you make your moves. 

This week I have seen two very worrying examples of typography. The first was a conversation with a student, who on the one hand told me he was a stickler for typography rules and on the other told me that kerning was no longer relevant to designers as “Indesign does it for you”, and past technologies (metal and photosetting) were ‘irrelevant to digital typography”.  I recommended <cite> ‘Elements’</cite>.

The second was a friend of a friend who sent us an 'e-catalogue' he'd just finished for his new employers. The catalogue was in flash, and when we zoomed-in the type at low resolution so it could not be distinguished, "but” he said, "the pages-turning effect is cool". 

Reading is not for everyone, but sometimes you have to just get on with it -- it will broaden your mind.

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding "First years", books on typography have their place but the instructor has the major role to play in how the class is presented and what gets emphasis. The students also have a role to play in either their demise or their success in typography. If a student does not have the desire to learn and is trying to maximize their beer drinking time by ignoring their studies, then they deserve to be the chaff which the wind driveth away. I am an old fart and there just were not many typography books available in 1962 when I was a freshmen in design school. We did not have a text book. We were required to purchase the ATF specimen card stack. Everything else we learned from the instructors and by hand-setting metal type. The jobstick is a cruel, unrelenting teacher. I wish I had all the books now available as a youngster back then but I think we were a dedicated lot of kids who took our work seriously. Students today may also be dedicated and those are the ones who will succeed. The party-timers will pass with the same exhale as their last beer burp and evaporate.

		<div class="commentbody">by now you've surmised from my semi-literate ranting that i never formally studied typography or graphic design. in school i was entirely focussed on painting and animation. i've had, nevertheless, a broad livelihood in motion graphics, a small percent of it involving typography informed primarily by my eyes, imagination, colleagues, memories, and clients.

the photo-lettering catalog was literally the first book relating strictly to typography that i opened. i was a teenager into circus type and it blew my mind from sheer variety. over the years i've picked up a few of the books mentioned in this thread: sheep, manual(s) of typog, designing with type, tschichold, emigre, and trendy anthologies : typography now, type club annuals, etc.

i was at mtv in the 90's when carson was mashing up print; everybody loved him, but i remembered saville's joy division, and i really liked steven gilmore's art for nettwerk. it's been an interesting process trying to reverse-educate myself back to foundation and classics. i am humbled, amazed, and educated by the posts on typophile.

i've derived a mandatory reading list from this thread. many real thanks.

It's fantastic that you've got some use from everyone's comments. 

As a 'bonus' book I would read (if you haven't already), <cite>A Short History of the Printed Word</cite> (Paperback) by Warren Chappell (Author), Robert Bringhurst (Editor). Chappell slipped-up on some of the dates and used <em>far too many</em> long words, but Bringhurst definitely made the new addition more accurate and accessible. 

<cite>'Short History'</cite> concerns the history of the theory and practice of type design and typography -- essential knowledge to typographic designers, despite the grumbles of some. Admittedly, I wasn't aware of the importance of heritage to typography whilst at university; however, the more books you read on the subject, the more you realise that, despite appearances, in many respects it's pretty much the same under the bonnet as it's always been.

No, honestly it might not be very valuable in terms of a How-To-handbook, but i still respect the man (and the book) for his uncompromising approach.

After that "Ausgewählte Aufsätze über Fragen der Gestalt des Buches und der Typographie" by Jan Tschicholdand then "Stop Stealing Sheep" as so many of you. After that I didn't own a book about typography until I bought "Thinking with Type" by Ellen Lupton last year. In art school we didn't read books at all (I think...).</div>

Not a book about typography, but generally about work ethics, work morale and related problems, and an attitude of doing something for the sake of itself (put very simply). I find it more enlightening and thought-provoking than 20 kgs of your average graphic design/typography books.</div>
