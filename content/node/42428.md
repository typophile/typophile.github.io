  anyone offer suggestions as to what the 2 or 3 main faces are in this? (\"Passiflora\"
  title, and \"Dodel \u2022 Port. Atlas.\") I'm most concerned about these two. Identifying
  the others would just be a bonus.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I don't know anything
  about it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wtf_is_this_4610.jpg]"

  body: "The whole page was done in lithography, which means that the separate colourplates
    were drawn on lithographic stones. Lettering was mostly done by hand, using samples
    or from heart. \r\nIn this case a special technique appears to have been used,
    where type was printed on special paper and offset on the stone. These typesamples
    could have been done/printed esp for the purpose, or words were comped out of
    sample sheets. \r\nAs you have probably noticed some of the glyphs in your image
    are reversed (upside down, like the two s'es in Passiflora).\r\nFor the inspiration/source
    you'll have to look into contemporary type (not the nicest period imho).\r\n\r\n.

  body: "Thanks Bert.\r\n\r\nThat makes a lot of sense. That being the case do you
    or anyone else have any idea what samples these might have been referencing?\r\n\r\nHere's
    the collection they come from:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.geheugenvannederland.nl/?/en/collecties/kennis_als_kunst:_botanische_onderwijsplaten_1870_-_1960
    \r\n\r\nSo is it safe to say the lithograph was done in the late 1800s?\r\n\r\n-B"
