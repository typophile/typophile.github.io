    as if the first Egyptians started their life as accompanying black weights of
    Modern text faces. In typography they served as black weights, but were they family
    members in the way we nowadays look at a family? What came first? Black modern
    weights or black egyptians?"

  body: "I\u2019d rather classify the typeface family as Modern. The light weight
    is a Modern Egyptian or Modern Slab Serif if you like. The black weight is a Modern
    typeface, so Modern is what they have in common. Instead of Modern one could also
    say Didonic. The trouble with most approaches to classifying typefaces is that
    they create a system with a fixed number of boxes with rather strict rules instead
    of describing the typefaces by formal principles. The latter would allow to work
    with as many \u2018boxes\u2019 as needed. Sometimes one only needs to distinguish
    between Sans and Serif, sometimes between Modern Slab Serif and Humanist Slab
    Serif, and occasionally one would like to distinguish between Venetian Serif and
    Humanist Serif, maybe even between Venetian Slab Serif and Humanist Slab Serif.
    Anyway, the main goal of classifying typefaces should be to enable designers to
    work with them and communicate their typographic and formal aspects, not putting
    them into boxes."

  body: "Of course the early Egyptians and Gothics were not part of any family. The
    very concept of the type family did not exist when those \u2018novelty\u2019 styles
    hit the type market\u2026 Those new, exotic, typefaces were meant for <em>combined</em>
    use with other styles, not by themselves: like capers or grenadine, they were
    natural born mixers. One could not even think of setting an entire book using
    black type\u2014Modern, Egyptian, or Gothic."
