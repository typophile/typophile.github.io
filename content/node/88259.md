  body: Each subtable of a GPOS table has a fixed size, so if your total kern feature
    exceeds this then it needs to be broken into multiple, smaller subtables. This
    used to be a manual process if one is using FontLab or another AFDKO based tool,
    involving entering subtable break codes into your kern feature syntax, and trying
    to figure out the best place to put these. Karsten Luecke has written a clever
    script, 'KLTF Make Kern Feature', that automatically calculates the optimum number
    of subtables for your kern data and how to divide them. I recommend reading the
    <a hreef="http://www.kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm"?>script manual</a> to confirm
    that this is what you need to resolve your issue. There is a $59 license fee for
    the script, but I reckon this is well worth it in terms of time saved.
