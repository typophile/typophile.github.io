  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I have posted several images below my long explanation!
I hope you guys can help me. I&rsquo;m a writer and have wandered into what seems a minefield regarding the legalities of using Fonts! 
I have several fonts which I need to identify. I also hope someone can give me some advice.</p>
<p>A friend who sadly passed away created several book covers for me  but the question of Fonts never came up back then, so I don&rsquo;t know what Fonts he used  Can you take a look at them and identify them for me Please.
To be sure I&rsquo;m doing the right thing, I need to know if it is LEGAL to use the fonts on a website as well as maybe as an e- book cover (and later print version). I have added the images below. Please please Help!
Advice&hellip;.
It is freaking me out, because some places say &ldquo;Free&rdquo; fonts&hellip;and I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s True.. but then there&rsquo;s something about &lsquo;copyright&rsquo;  and you need to credit the owner, which I want to do- It&rsquo;s probably me being dumb But it is Really difficult trying to Find the owners!
I need to know How and Where do I put the credits for them. Can anyone tell mehow to do this..eg if I use the images on a video?
David font&hellip;
One font I do know is named &ldquo;David&rdquo; and on many sites it is claimed to be Free.. but when I tried to find the owner..to ask permission as well as credit them, I could find Nothing! Does anyone know what I should do - if anything - regarding this?
Any help would be very much appreciated. Thanks. Nat.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>CHARLY is <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/victorian/' target='_blank'>Victorian</a> - manually made heavier. It&rsquo;s a good example to clarify how to use fonts commercially. If you purchase a copy of the font from a centralized seller like MyFonts or Fontshop - or directly from Linotype - it comes with a license that spells out how it may be used. On MyFonts, you can view the end user license before you pay for the font. With proof of payment and a license allowing commercial use (virtually all commercial fonts), you are good to go to use the font in your project. No need to credit anyone.</p>
<p>The vast majority of free font websites call themselves that because they are giving away fonts that youcan download without paying. thte often include lots of commercial fonts they have no right to give away. You could find Victorian on plenty of these sites, but using such an illicit download commercially would be a mistake. Lots of other fonts on these sites are ripoff clones of commercial fonts. Those too it would be inadvisable to use.</p>
<p>Oh, and then there are the legitimately free font creations out there. Those almost always had documentation with them that might spell out any usage limitations - but those free font sites rarely include that documentation.</p>
<p>How to know what&rsquo;s what? Ask us here! That&rsquo;s my nutshell version. Others will surely be able to expand and clarify.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mike, Thanks so much for everything you did - especially explaining things, it was very helpful.
I have taken out the Text on those images and am now looking for the genuine Free fonts.
I created an e-book cover - for everyone else it seems easy to do&hellip; for me, it was more like splitting the atom!!
so, I was very upset when I came across the Legal questions about using fonts.</p>
<p>So&hellip; may I ask Another question, please. I recently used software called Paint.net and they have text options on it.  Apparantly they purchased this software from Microsoft, if that helps.</p>
<p>Are those Fonts okay to use? The one I want to use is called DAVID - I posted and image of it on the previous posting. I have emailed Paint.net direct to ask them&hellip;but I don&rsquo;t know if they will reply, so I hope you guys will be able to tell me. Regards, Nat.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Mike. This is an excellent introduction of the issues of how a designer can use a font. A major question for designers is whether a font can be legitimately modified for logos artwork etc. I wonder if we have a FAQ that does or could include this type of info?
As for license documentation with free fonts, the best site I have seen is Font Squirrel. Dafont is part way there.

Perhaps the gurus in <a href="http://typophile.com/forum/7">http://typophile.com/forum/7</a> or <a href="http://typophile.com/forum/4">http://typophile.com/forum/4</a> could do a better job of answering them.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yikes - as Don said, this is going way beyond the scope of this forum.</p>
<p>I hope I made it clear above that you aren&rsquo;t going to find Victorian or Cascade as &ldquo;genuine Free fonts&rdquo; because they are commercial fonts you need to pay for to be licensed to use commercially (or even privately, for that matter).</p>
<p>Next, Paint.net was not purchased from MS. It was originally a college senior project that MS mentored, per the website (getpaint.net , if anyone else wants to check it out). I&rsquo;m not certain, but it sounds like the program simply uses the fonts that are already on your computer. Regarding the font David - if you know how to find David in your Fonts folder, right-click on it, choose Properties and see if you can find any copyright info on one of the tabs.</p>
<p>If you find copyright info, let us know what it is and we <em>might</em> be able to clarify the status of David. Beyond that, Don provided links to two forums that would be more appropriate for legal questions.</p>
