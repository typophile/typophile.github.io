  here (black): http://www.typophile.com/node/77840\r\n\r\nThe aim of Sensato SERIF
  is to be very legible at small sizes and still interesting on larger sizes. It has
  influences from Garamond, Calluna and Centro Serif, resulting in a fun mix between
  old comfort and modern crispness. I'm quite pleased with how it works in text. So
  much, that I have adjusted the colour of the Sans to fit with this, instead of the
  other way around. ALL feedback is much appreciated. It's only lowercase for now.
  I hope to include Caps soon. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nCheers, Jasper de Waard\r\n\r\nupdate
  3: The whole design has been adjusted towards a more modern, clean look. More like
  Calluna or Centro Serif now. I think it's much better now, hope you agree."

  body: "I like!\r\n\r\nA couple of observations:\r\n\r\n- the upper left diamond
    serif on letters like n and m is thinner than the stem. Is that on purpose?\r\n-
    the thick strokes of v, w and y get really thin really fast. I see the idea, but
    it's a bit too strong for me.\r\n- you increased the x-height -- a lot. This makes
    the face less formal, and allows for tighter lines, but right now I just feel
    that the ascenders are weak. Not more legible, just weak. Not too sure how to
    fix this one.\r\n- in the PDF, the letters stand relatively wide apart. I guess
    you haven't really done spacing yet (can't blame ya!), but maybe this influences
    my first impression too.\r\n- you castrated terminals everywhere, but haven't
    really turned them into anything yet. Everyone feels familiar with Garamond-ish
    fonts, and most people's eyes will stumble over those amputated pieces. If you're
    not a fan of the drops and tails, at least turn them into something more ... solid?
    Whatever you do, the stumps right now don't really work with the diamond serifs.
    \r\n\r\nThis looks really friendly to me, and I really think this has potential!
    Keep us posted!\r\n"

  body: "-Yes. that's on purpose, but it does look 'wrong' to me now, so I'll align
    them more closely. \r\n-You could well be right about that. I'll try a new version
    of v w y\r\n-Maybe that's because the diamonds are too small?\r\n-Yes. I used
    the inDesign 'optical' function and manually increased the spacing, because I
    like the feel of it. I might have exagerated it a bit however.\r\n-Castrated?
    I just took them from Sensato Sans, where nobody so far has had a problem with
    it. I still think they look fine. In other words: To me they don't look as if
    they don't belong there.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your feedback. I'll upload an
    update as soon as possible, but I'm also working on the Sans, so it might take
    longer than a week. Cheers!\r\n"

  body: "No doubt you have a good startpoint here. I see you did adopt these features:\r\n\r\n\u2013
    ascenders and descenders much shorter than AG;\r\n\u2013 x-height scaled-up;\r\n\u2013
    rounded terminals replaced by a smaller triangular shape;\r\n\u2013 straight serifs;\r\n\u2013
    ink traps; and\r\n\u2013 rounded corners.\r\n\r\nYour goal is to make the font
    more modern and as confortable as its reference. The question is: which elements
    would convert these adjectives into an articulate design?\r\n\r\nFrom the characteristics
    present, straight serifs help to give a more modern feel reducing the calligraphic
    influence. Ink traps help confort with sharper prints. Both work in the direction
    you aim.\r\n\r\nRounded corners are very nice, but will not cause big effect at
    text sizes. No influence on your goal, although a relevant feature for display
    sizes.\r\n\r\nYour ascenders and descenders are quite short, especially after
    the x-height was increased. <em>Here</em> you have a problem regarding the confort
    issue. Reading experience would be more confortable and fluid with ascenders and
    descenders taller \u2013not necessarily as much as AG, but surely bigger than
    this Sensato version.\r\n\r\nYou may search Typophile for in-depth discussion
    about excessively high x-heights and book fonts. I remember Hrant has some very
    good analysis on this. I was initially skeptical about short ascenders and descenders
    to be a bad choice for book fonts, but became convinced after extensive tests
    with my own font project.\r\n\r\nStill about asc/desc, Sebastian said they seem
    weak. I agree and think this is because they are short and doesn't have proeminent
    terminals/serifs/diamonds. You can observe most contemporary fonts with short
    asc/desc use to have strong serifs and terminals (v.g. Swift, Fedra, Greta or
    Centro). A strong finish compensates the small height of the stems.\r\n\r\nHence,
    my main suggestion is you to evaluate the basic proportion between x-height and
    asc/desc. To change this in a further stage would cause a huge amount of work.\r\n\r\nAbout
    terminals, I second Sebastian's opinion. You reduced their size and changed their
    shape. I think the problem is not with the shape, which appears in various glyphs
    in a consistent way. But they are lacking expression, what I believe can be solved
    with a bigger size. Note that a positive critique about this \u2013or any other
    feature\u2013 relative to Sensato Sans may not be equally valid for the serif
    companion.\r\n\r\nI also agree the stem variations in |v|w|y| are abrupt. Top
    detail of q is very small. Stress points of o are thicker than other stress points
    (as |b|d|p|q| curves). There are small vector bumps in g (upper bowl, conection
    at bottom), d (top curve), f (rounded right corner in bar), p (bottom curve) and
    v (internal serifs).\r\n\r\nHope some of this would be useful. Keep the good work!"

    but I'm trying to get insight into the subject and it's useful to try to understand
    the details.)\r\n\r\nTwo things I'm wondering slightly about:\r\n\r\n* Isn't the
    letter v placed a smidgen too low? Of course it goes below the baseline a little
    - as it should - but it's much more noticeable than with AG.\r\n\r\n* Isn't the
    colour slightly too dark on the o and the c? I haven't printed the PDF but reading
    on screen those letters stand out."

    what I did with the inner serifs in v w x y, for better legibilty on small sizes.
    Is it not disturbing at display sizes? I believe I fixed the issues sebastian
    and Freiberger pointed out to me, but let me know if you see anything that doesn't
    work for you. Hope you like it, enjoy! I didn't update the jpg picture btw, so

    Dutchman on the forums. :) And this looks like it'll be a nice typeface.\r\n\r\nI
    think that the ascenders en descenders are still a bit too short, at least if
    you want to achieve a Garamond-kind of feel. Also, the 'c' seems a bit out of
    character, and perhaps a bit too narrow and heavy? That doesn't look like a rendering
    issue, because it persists when I zoom in and out in the PDF. The 's' feels a
    bit on the light side. Perhaps you could add a bit more weight to the tail of
    the 'y'?\r\n\r\n(btw, just out of curiosity, is the 1996 an indication of your
    age?) :)"

  body: "Yep, I've only just turned 15. I don't think I want to achieve a Garamond
    feel (I've never been good at setting a goal and sticking to it). I want to achiev
    the same comfortable reading experience as garamond. I'm pleased with the ascenders
    and descenders now. Furthermore, I also have to take the Sans into account. It's
    ascenders/descenders would look rediculously long with Garamonds' proportions.
    The c is a bit of a personal thing. I always find 'normal' c a bit distracting
    as it creates a large gap in the word. I'll review the width/thickness again though.
    That s is a little light indeed, though I wouldn't know what to do about it (spine
    is already quite thick) and Garamonds s is also quite light. However, this will,
    just like the y, also be reviewed. One of the most important lessons I've learned
    so far is to never deny critique without having tried.\r\n\r\nBedankt Jelmar. "

    it. It probably only needs a minuscule amount of extra weight anyway. As for the
    ascenders and descenders, I think they're ok as they are, I just thought they
    were too short compared to Garamond. If you've let go of the Garamond-feel, then
    they are fine as they are.\r\n\r\nI think it's very cool that you're into type

  body: "Congrats! I really like the feel of the /y/! The /k/ is neat. I also like
    the Calluna-like serifs.\r\nSmall, rapid observations:\r\n- the bowl of the lowercase
    /a/ seems a bit loose. I like it's form, but perhaps lifting its stress point
    a little up (the thick-region) would help.\r\n- The form of the /s/ is <strong>s</strong>plendid,
    yet I think it is now too dark in comparison with the rest of the alphabet.\r\n-
    Most important, I think, is to notice that the overall contrast of the characters
    is too high. Specially if you look at the /r/, /n/, etcetera, their high contrast
    is alike to other fonts ment specifically for display sizes, but yours is ment
    for setting text.\r\n- I don't know if your /g/ shape is helpful in terms of legibility.
    It's loop stands out far to the right, making a \"sharp\" curve, which may look
    good, but will prevent you from kerning upright letters with serifs at the bottom
    (/l/, /h/, /n/,...) a bit tighter. For instance, look at the \"gh\". It's clear
    that there is a gap, but with the actual forms there aren't much things you could
    improve with just kerning...\r\n- I also think the head serifs (/r/) are too heavy
    compared to the rest of the serifs. (Perhaps that impression vanishes solving
    my last observation).\r\n- Finally, keep revising the flowing of the curves (ie.
    /a/) and think about consistency of terminals (/r/,/y/ || /a/,/c/,/f/)\r\nGood
    work; keep retouching it!"
