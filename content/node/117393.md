  body: Ryuk makes a good point - always shop around,  URW lets you buy individual

  body: "Looks like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/search/bodoni|Bodoni]] Bold to
    me. The [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/bodoni-bq|Berthold version]] could
    be the closest. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/urw-bodoni|URW]] is close too
    (and far cheaper ~15$).\r\n\r\nEDIT: Bob confirmed Berthold Bodoni Bold. I wish
    you had US$ 250 (only sold as complete family)..."
