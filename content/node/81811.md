body: "Hello, everyone! I'm on my first book layout project and I'm having trouble
  setting the baseline rhythm. The manuscript has a lot of blockquotes and footnotes.\r\n\r\nBody
  type is set in 11 pt Minion Pro.\r\n\r\nBlockquotes, footnotes and endnotes are
  also in Minion Pro, though at 9.5 pt. (I've made all three equal in size...is this
  sort of visual hierarchy advisable?)\r\n\r\nThese are what I hope to achieve:\r\n<ul><li>Leading
  for body type that is proportional to the one used for blockquotes, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Baselines
  that match up on both sides of the page (this is a developing country and we don't
  always have good quality paper)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nI've tried setting tiny baseline
  increments I can multiply later, for example, 2 or 3 pts. I don't mind the lines
  so much, and I'm able to maintain proportionate leading by tweaking font sizes.
  However, the baselines don't match up on both sides of the page.\r\n\r\nAny tips?
  I've looked through some threads about baselines in this forum, but so far I haven't
  encountered recommendations specifically for book design. "

    might want to consider upping the blockqoute, but this all depends on the style
    you are after. If they are more important than the notes they should get more
    attention. The New Yorker have smaller quotes in text, btw. It works quite nice
    for them.\r\n\r\nAre you using Minion\u2019s optical sizes?"

  body: Yes, definitely lock the main body text to the baseline grid. Don't drop the
    point size of block quotes. (I know this is very typical, but it's a Victorian
    custom with no real benefit; simply indent both sides of the quote to match the
    paragraph indents, or set in italics or sans serif or something; no need to drop
    the size.) If you disagree and do end up setting the block quotes smaller, incorporate
    a blank line as a "space before" option in the style, then manually baseline-shift
    the whole quote to visually center it between the line above and the line below,
    the position of which will be determined by the grid.

    is actually the first time I've heard of the term. How do I find out if I can
    use the optical sizes? \r\n\r\n@Frank Adebiaye: Thank you for the recommendation.
    That's definitely on my to-buy list.\r\n\r\n@Joshua Langman: I decided to set
    the quotes in the same size, though for future projects I'm trying out your other
    suggestion to see if I interpret your instructions correctly."

  body: "As you can see [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/minion/|here]] Minion
    comes with a multitude of versions. I\u2019m refering to Capt(ion), Disp(lay),
    Subh(eader). These are, in addition to the normal version the optical masters.
    Each version is intended to be used at a specific size. You\u2019ll have do some
    exploring yourself, but the idea is to have a page of even color across all sizes.
    A good optical size also take into consideration the typical needs for it\u2019s
    intended size. This might include changing the cap-height, x-height, ascenders
    or descenders length, spacing, width, weight, trapping, degree of openness, etc.
    One size does not really fit all, even though digital makes it possible."

    I''ve used them on past projects without knowing they were optical masters. Thanks
    for clarifying that for me!'

  body: 'Block quotes one point smaller than the main text and indented is a standard
    practice, and will look "normal" to readers. I''m not sure if it''s wise to have
    your baseline grid any finer than 1/2 your normal text line size (point size +
    leading). You want your bottom lines on facing pages to line up. When I did this
    recently, I didn''t lock the block quotes to the grid, but let them float, and
    made visually equal space before and after. Maybe there are better ways to do
    it, but that worked. '
