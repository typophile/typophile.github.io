What is the difference between "[[ampersand|&]]" and "and"_?

It may be a silly question but i really don't know where to use what. 
What is the main difference but_? I am working on a book publication and the title for that book is, "Design & System". Now how do i write it_? Which way would be better and why_?

		<div class="commentbody">& is a ligature for the French word et. Over time it became so popular that it spread into other languages; becoming a more general Latin language symbol. The difference is context - sometimes it just looks better to use & than it does to spell out the word and. It is a somewhat conservative symbol; contemporary designers have begun replacing it with + here in the US, particularly when used with Sans Serif type. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Satya, are you asking when the usage of one or the other is more appropriate?

The ampersand is more often used in business names or book titles, those that are comprised of a short list of product or proprietor names, such as "Dungeons & Dragons", "Dewey, Cheatham, & Howe, Accounting", or "An Jan Grain & Feed".

The ampersand is frowned upon in body text unless citing such a proper name that normally uses one. Your use of the ampersand for your book title is totally sane and appropriate, but entirely optional.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just a further historical note: & is a ligature (not an abbreviation) for e+t, long in use both for 'and' and as part of any other word, e.g. 'proph&a'. It first became usual in late Roman cursive (ca 3rd cent. AD), but it really became something special in 8th- to 12th-cent. Caroline minuscule, when the many other old ligatures in existence were discarded except for that one. It then disappeared from 13th-cent. gothic scripts, only to be restored in 15th-cent. humanistic writing. 
Yours &c.

		<div class="commentbody">PPS The same for Wikipedia (pardon, Thierry). I'm not sure I would consider the image on the left an ampersand at all, more like just e and t close together, or let's say it's a late adaptation, but with a completely different structure from the old Roman ligature. 

As for the 'italic ampersand' (on the right), it's something else altogether, and much more recent: an Italian Renaissance creation, inspired I think by Byzantine calligraphy. (That's why the e and t are easier to recognise in it.)

Not to mention the modern 'handwritten ampersand' illustrated which is obviously just a sloppy +.

PPPS Senza offesa Alessandro. Actually, although it was born as a ligature, it has now become an abbreviation. & buon app&ito 2 U.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On the other hand, since Latin doesn't have nearly enough symbols to begin with, it's much better if/when the ampersand doesn't look like E/e+t. Same with the @: the less the inside looks like an "a" the better.

BTW, that wiki says the ampersand sometimes appears (more like used to appear) as the last letter of the alphabet, and that reminds me to mention that in Armenian the "yev" (a ligation of yetch and hyoun - the latter often called "bzdig vuh" = "little v") which means "and" is quite often placed before the last two letters of our alphabet. There are two reasons for this: the last two letters (oh and feh) were added later (to better accomodate foreign names); and it makes the number of letters divisible by three, which makes reciting the alphabet sound better. The bad news is that this -along with the timeless facilitative advantages of ligatures, and the fact that the yev is indeed elementally letters- causes many people to use the yev as actual letters in words. Imagine "h&y" in English for comparison...  :-/

Brad, we use “è” as a verb ("he/she/it is"), "and" is "e", no accent——"pane e vino", but "pane & vino" sounds more tasty is those buddy stand alone. It's time for dinner here, in Turkish, "et" is meat, "ev" is "home", "ev&" is "yes", what a mèss, buon appetito.</div>

(Once worked with an architect on a museum exhibit who decided he was a graphic designer, and created the most useless piece of print I've ever seen in my life, and which was universally panned by the high-end graphics/ID firm who were donating their service for the project. The architect told me that he was much more "qualified" to do this than anyone else  because "I'm an architect, and I can design anything.")

		<div class="commentbody">To add to the +: 

Nicole d' Oresme (1323-1382) may have used a figure which looks like a plus symbol as an abbreviation for the Latin et (meaning "and") in Algorismus proportionum, believed to have been written between 1356 and 1361. The symbol appears in a manuscript of this work believed to have been written in the fourteenth century, but perhaps by a copyist and not Oresme himself. The symbol appears, for example, in the sentence: "Primi numeri sesquiterti sunt .4. et .3., et primi numeri sev termini sesquialtere sunt .3. et .2." [Dic Sonneveld].

The plus symbol as an abbreviation for the Latin et, though appearing with the downward stroke not quite vertical, was found in a manuscript dated 1417 (Florian Cajori).

The + and - symbols first appeared in print in Mercantile Arithmetic or Behende und hüpsche Rechenung auff allen Kauffmanschafft, by Johannes Widmann (born c. 1460), published in Leipzig in 1489. However, they referred not to addition or subtraction or to positive or negative numbers, but to surpluses and deficits in business problems (Cajori vol. 1, page 128).

Source:
http://members.aol.com/jeff570/mathsym.html


Of course, the 'and' and the symbol + is used as a mathematical operation in these examples.</div>

I agree. Satya, I was taught that the ampersand is ok to use if you're fighting for space in a title or headine that contains the word 'and'. The logic is that it's a contraction* so it takes up less (horizontal) space than three characters. In a body text situation, the convention is to spell words out in full, which is why Gill's using it throughout the text of the 'Essay on Typography' was so er, iconoclastic.

		<div class="commentbody">Never before have I heard someone call the ampersand punctuation (which may well be because I'm not really anglophone and because the meaning of <em>punctuation</em> is different from the German <em>Interpunktion</em>), but Google tells me that this interpretation isn't as abnormal as I would've thought.

I'd agree, though, that the ampersand isn't a word and shouldn't be used as such.

The ampersand is undoubtedly a ligature. A ligature without a surrounding word. Hence, I'd call it a standalone ligature.

In terms of where to use it properly, I'd spontaneously compare it (loosely) to a titling "The" with Th ligature: in many typefaces too uncommon looking a ligature, IMHO, to be appropriate for running text, but nice to have for titles and logos (or wherever type bears a strong graphic aspect).

In terms of intrinsic meaning, the ampersand is no substitute for an ordinary "and". I'd never use it like <em>"I was terribly jetlagged & slept for thirty hours"</em> (much like I'd never use the + sign in text context). Instead, the ampersand is a way to express that things or persons are strongly linked and form a unity; it's used mainly in formal, soigné or festive context. (Personally, I wouldn't be overly hesitating to use a beautiful ampersand in "Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year" if the words were set in a designed arrangement and not running text.)

When the ampersand is used in corporate names (<em>"... introduced us to Mr. Frederick Fine from Fine & Dandy..."</em>), it becomes, in my eyes, part of a (typo)graphic unit that shouldn't be disintegrated (into <em>"Frederick Fine from Fine and Dandy"</em>) without necessity.

Please note that this is my German point of view. In other languages, the use of the ampersand might be different (although I can't recall to have seen the ampersand used in contemporary English or French as an arbitrary substitute for the word "and").

>>>Pick up Eric Gill's An Essay on Typography. The ampersand is all over the place in place of and. Here's an example from page 21 of the most commonly available facsimile (sorry Godine publishers, I love your books, but this edition has a terrible cover.)

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gill_6653.jpg]

Gill: "The absurd rule that the ampersand (&) should only be used in 'business titles' must be rescinded, & there are many other contractions which a sane typographer should encourage."

I should also say that Gill didn't like to wear underwear and that the last chapter on his advocacy of phonography is a bit looney...

Geoffrey Dowding's Finer Points in the Spacing & Arrangement of Type also makes a very passionate argument for the use of the ampersand in the actual text body.  

Dowding gives as an example Manutius's Hypernerotmachia Poliphili:

Which is not to say there can only be one or even two ampersands in a font!
For one thing, accomodating different vertical alignments, like one matching
caps, another harmonizing with mixed-case text, yet another for smallcaps, etc.
can be very useful.

Which is particularly true in this case. With respect to Bleisetzer assumption that the "ct" ligature was an "Et" comes from where the type specimen placed it.

Why is the "ct" not listed with it's companions "ch", "ck" and "c-swash k"?
Since it is placed prior to the actual "et" and "&" it made it appear as if it truly was an ampersand.

Interesting... eh?

Hehe Linda, you have no idea how funny that strikes me at this particular moment. Aren't universities fun? .~ (to refer to another thread...)

Here, though, we prefer to ALWAYS spell out our "and"... even when it looks cleaner and makes more sense to use & ... 

I have also recently encountered the "I'm not a designer, but I think this would look better" administrative personnel. After a few days she stopped prefacing her comments with "I'm not a designer, but" and began simply dictating the details of the layout to me in emails that went along the lines of "what about if we moved this left, made that bold, centred that, put the fleurons on the other headers, and removed the "lines"?" Sure. No problem. (biting tongue to keep from saying those are paragraph rules, not lines.)
