  from a pre-digital dry transfer sheet used to make a font -- Mr. Black -- brought
  to my attention by Ryuk\r\nIt looks a lot like Helvetica Inserat but the J is different.\r\nI
  checked other pre-digital suspects but found nothing closer.\r\nAny suggestions?
  Did I miss a match?\r\nThanks.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thanks Bob. According to Identifont Rod McDonald designed this in 2000 based
    on influences from Compacta and Helvetica Condensed. I did check the digital outlines
    of Smart against those of Mr. Black and found that the bold weight is fairly close
    to the unknown pre-digital font used to make Mr. Black.\r\nStill searching. Perhaps
    it has not been digitized. Have no information as to the source of the dry transfer
    sheet used for Mr. Black other than it was used in Poland. Photolettering? Filmotype?
    European company? The mystery persists.\r\nDon"

  body: "At first glance, Folio Bold Condensed looks to have a few similarities but
    when I did an overlay the J and Q are very different, plus the N, M and W are
    much wider. Oh hum - just an observation. Variants of Akzindens may be worth looking
    at, as Helvetica, Univers and Folio are all part of the Swiss \"International
    Typographic Style\". \r\nGood hunting!"
