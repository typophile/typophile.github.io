    \ And should it be more reflective of Nairobi art and culture? \r\n\r\nI'm not
    sure why the C is rotated; does it symbolize something or is it just to emphasize
    the C?"

  body: Have you thought about what is going to happen when the logo is minimized?
    the fine lines of the square will completely disappear and the "ramoma collection"
    will be unlegible.

  body: You should work more on this. Look for other ideas which one should reveal
    the essence of the Museum.

  body: Agree with all of the above. There are many, many Museum of Contemporary Art
    ________s in the world. First thing I would do is look at every single museum
    identity that you can. Understand what is out there, why they are appropriate
    for their particular institution, location, time. How old are they? How have they
    aged or evolved? What is the collection of the museum, and how does that reflect
    the mission. How does this logo turn into a complete identity? What city is this
    in? Who will be the visitors? Does this museum EVEN NEED a logo? While this may
    seem counterintuitive, maybe the answer is no. And if the answer is yes, think
    about why that is? Perhaps it's the typeface which carries the weight of the identity.
    Another consideration is that while you don't want the logo to be totally generic
    and boring, you also don't want it to be so loud and complicated that it overshadows
    the artwork (i.e. the reason you are all doing what you do, the stars of the show).
    Find that balance. Museums are very special places, and are rare and great opportunities
    to design something truly wonderful. This is the first contemporary art gallery
    in the entire country. Why is this happening now, what is the character of the
    contemporary art world in that place. What is unique about this? Don't take that
    lightly. All the best.
