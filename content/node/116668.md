  body: "edited:\r\nOn closer examination, I would go with Titling Gothic Skyline
    Bold -- as suggested by R -- for the top line  and the date, and Titling Gothic
    Compressed Bold edited to be further compressed to 90% for the big letters in
    the second line. As shown in my previous post.\r\nDone"

    spacing has been tightened for all texts, but an overlay of the letters on the
    poster with the ones from the FontShop preview shows that they perfectly coincide."
