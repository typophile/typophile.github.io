body: "When too many coincidences pile up, I find myself disturbed\u2014which is no
  news to anyone, right? But\u2026\r\n\r\nThe last couple of days, my primary computer
  will not shut down completely, even when I command it to do so; instead, as I walk
  away, I am informed that some or another unspecified \u201Cbackground program\u201D
  is waiting to close. Okay, fine, I say: if that\u2019s the case, I can make sure
  no mischief is done by powering off the network router.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I try
  to unlock the computer, I get a cursor which is attempting to control\u2026absolutely
  nothing there. Okay, I say: if there ever was a time for suspicion to turn to paranoia,
  it might be time to consider that transition. Especially since AOL \u201Cimproved\u201D
  my mailbox by making it take longer to navigate\u2014thereby spend more time distracted\u2014which
  only became a little more uncomfortable when what might be interpreted as a temporary
  glitch looked suspiciously like a subliminal suggestion. To me. Quite disturbingly
  possibly.\r\n\r\nAs a favor to all, please prove me wrong at your earliest convenience.
  On a grandpa box: you folks who are constantly connected are on your own: if I am
  not wrong, I do not know how to prove or disprove my \u201Cqualms.\u201D OTOH, if
  you do not see an inherent problem with hi-res displays, Apple\u2019s recent acquisition
  of a fingerprint-scanning company, GPS, inside jobs, lack of a paper trail to prove
  otherwise\u2014especially since Google maps can, theoretically, place you walking
  out of a store in which you did not actually make a purchase but someone can prove
  that you were there (T\xE9! You ARE the man!)\u2014then, I have proven conclusively
  that I am deeply disturbed. Crazy boad? Crazy good?\r\n\r\nOn another hand, I am
  probably totally wrong that Hakim Bey\u2019s proposal for a Pirate Utopia (Google
  it while you can find it, and save) can, quite paradoxically, look like a new Digital
  Declaration of Independence, OR a swell, chapter-and-verse indictment for the most
  amazing fraud\u2014downside\u2014and incredible opportunity (we all gotta eat) that
  has even been squandered in human history.\r\n\r\nWhich, if I pray I am wrong, may
  well soon end as we know it\u2014if we can still breathe the air next year. Close
  the book and begin a new one, or not drink a beer (or drink an non-alcoholic beer:
  same thing, same words\u2014with the \u201Calcoholic\u201D left out. Believe me,
  you can have more fun with trying to get people to open a bottle and not drink a
  beer than you can imagine: so, please do try it at home. Or in public. If someone
  calls the cops, someone other than you will have to do the serious explaining: you
  can\u2019t take a joke if you don\u2019t know it\u2019s a joke; nonetheless, the
  joke can STILL be on you, and that is NOT funny.\r\n\r\nOne and done: my old, currently-completely-offline
  computer is mighty handy when I pray to God I am completely wrong. Because, if I
  have one shot and it disappears soon, that is the worst possible proof that I am
  not crazy. Still: someone owes me a beer\u2014AND\u2014I got a guy to deliver the
  rimshots. If anything is funny after this. Anyhow. I HAVE to check my email and
  see how font sales are doing. No news is good news, but good news is even better\u2026than
  none. Duh.\r\n\r\nP.S. Let the language professionals decoded the conditional clauses,
  because I might be in a subjunctive mood. P.S. Obama \u2022 McCain 2012; replaced
  Timid Tim with Mitt RIGHT NOW (he ought to be plenty pissed with every GOOD reason
  to fight the guys who set him up to get rough up). Sarah: Department of Interior.
  Ron Paul: Chairman of the Fed. Bonus: it is hard to misspell \u201CRon Paul\u201D
  in successive phishing emails. Sanity or insanity: this may be my last chance. For
  a free beer.\r\n"

  body: "Well, I am gratified for your vote of no-confidence in something. Which makes
    about as much sense as anything else today, including regaining control of my
    main computer, but only after the troubleshooter fixed some unspecified problem
    which, apparently, it had not either encountered, or which may not have previously
    existed. Either way: mystery unsolved...\r\n\r\nAnd I STILL don't have a firm
    offer for one stinking beer. What does a guy have to do to catch a break around
    here\u2026except do a cold shutdown and reboot in order to know exactly where
    I am pointing before I actually click? With as loony as my real life has been
    the past couple of weeks, I could be sending all of my retirement money to Adolf
    Hitler\u2026and, as long as the check went through ACH, as far as my bank\u2014and
    Hitler himself, for obvious by potentially impossible reasons (I hope to God)\u2014is
    or are concerned (depends on what I am really talking about, so\u2026), everything
    is hunky-dory\u2026except my bank balance. And my future.\r\n\r\nWhich is awfully
    dim, if I can't solve most of our immediate problems the only sensible way AND
    not get a free beer out of the deal. Boy! Talk about a TOUGH CROWD!\r\n\r\nOTOH,
    my weekly sales report appears to confirm that most\u2014but not all\u2014at least,
    not YET all\u2014of the world agrees that I am nuts. I guess I am: I have a simple
    problem that, surely, SOMEONE at Adobe may potentially be able to handle (hopefully),
    which would make a potential moneymaker (for me, mostly) and, IMHO, great design
    aid at an outrageously reasonable price (an actual plus for the uninformed buyers),
    and\u2014NOBODY in the type community has a clue as to how to recode a swatch
    and leave the 0,0 origin intact. How hard can it be? Apparently, almost impossible.
    I am not COMPLETELY sure.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell: I waste the opportunity for a
    load of free pan-European launch publicity, and turn all the freeloaders into
    beta testers. No free lunch, right? No free beer, for sure. PLUS: I may give the
    guys, gal and/or both who actually solve (or solves) THE problem which the company
    which peddles this product (for the big bucks, and which a cheap app makes more
    functional) star billing in the Document Info. AND\u2026I will buy them a free
    beer, no matter where they live or how much it reasonably (big qualifier) costs.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,
    since I honor my father, I may feel fiscally and friendlily compelled, at least,
    to suggest Schlitz\u2026"
