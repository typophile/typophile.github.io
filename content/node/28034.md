  only problem is that it seems like this Microsoft MSN Group is sort of \u201Ddead\u201D
  \u2013 and this is the ONLY place you gould get it (of course).\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
  this usual b*** \u2013 one applies for membership, and then the all mighty moderator,
  administrator or whatever she or he is called, is suppose to \u201Dapprove\u201D
  me, descide if I\u2019m worthy or not just by knowing my e-mail adress ;-)\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I guess this person is maybe on vacation on a small Island without an Internet connection,
  good for him \u2013 but wouldnt it be easier if Microsoft just put it on their website,
  since they do claim that they are there to support type delevopers.\r\n\r\nCould
  it be found some where else perhaps? :)"

    I'd suggest a new policy - email first, rant later. And yes, today is a holiday
    here in the US. Happy Labor Day! \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "Si,\r\n\r\nOh, I mailed Microsoft right after this topic, just to see if
    there was some other way of getting the Validator. I was however talking about
    the MSN Group (which I applied last week), and was not aware of that it\u2019s
    the same people behind the two. I thought these groups were run by non-officials,
    not the people of Microsoft. Sorry if my topic sounded harch or something (it\u2019s
    my bad english \u2013 it was supposed to sound humourous).\r\n\r\nNow I see however,
    that maybe my mail to Microsoft did it \u2013 I got approved for the groups :)\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks for that, and apologies."

    ago. I understand that Microsoft may want to keep track of who has the tool, but
    the way it''s presented is a bit odd. It sounds like one is being evaluated for
    worthyness or something. Really, MS should get it into the hands of anyone who
    knows what it''s for. '

  body: "Does anyone here know the current status of this tool?  We have a custom
    font that seems to be causing some problems and we'd like to check it out.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    \ I applied to join the MSN group three days ago and had no response thus far;
    \ which given the size of Microsoft is surprising.  I'm a little concerned that
    since the page hasn't been updated for over four years it may have dropped into
    disuse.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case;  can anyone recommend any other tools for
    checking the validity of a TrueType font?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for any help."

    weeks at least. Eventually I totally forgot about it, so the approval was a pleasant
    surprise.\r\n\r\nMind, it's a pretty useful tool. For my taste, it has a rather
    weird \"beginner's\" look, what with the drag-n-drop windows and lists, but the
    information is right on the spot."

    put it out for everyone, like the FDK? I mean it is free already. Can it do any
