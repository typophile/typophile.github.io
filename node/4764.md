body: Someone in another forum suggested to me that to find out a font name used in
  a particular pdf file, I could just select some text and from any &#34;context menu&#34;,
  see what the name of the font selected was.  Does anyone know what a context menu
  in Acrobat is, and if this guy was wrong, how do you find out the name of a particular
  font in a pdf document, such as the front page of a newspaper?

    here you can gather the names of all the fonts in a document -- from there it&#39;s
    up to you to attribute the names. as for selecting and identifying specific fonts,
    I&#39;ve never heard of such an option. '

  body: OK, I did exactly what you said, but I don&#39;t have a &#34;properties&#34;
    option when I right-click on the text.  It isn&#39;t even a grayed-out option.  I
    have a pre-release of Acrobat 6.0, could that be why?  Someone look at the front
    page of the Albuquerque Journal and see if it tells you what some of the text
    is.
