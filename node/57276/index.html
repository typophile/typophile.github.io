Although a mountain is cliché for climbing I wonder what other images might be more evocative and keep some of the mystery of the legend whole. Tracks are also a bit cliché but I wonder about other visual elements.</p>
<p>I also wonder about Nepalese flavor, as you see in the Sherpa brand.</p>

I would also think about using a different typeface, its appropriate, but is used a lot and theres more then one freeware lookalikes. Perhaps try drawing a stylized backpack for the border, you might need to draw the top of the yetis shoulders, but I think that would work good.</p>

<p>I agree that the approach might be quiet direct, but i wanted to give kinda a hardcore fun side to the climbing, rather then an old style serious one. All the climbing brands I have looked are mainly badly done or too serious, unlike skate boarding and snowboarding brands who have a really fun universe around them.  For the Nepalese flavor, its a climbing group in Belgium&hellip; and I don&rsquo;t think they even know that the yeti is a legend from Nepal. I will keep your advice in mind and try to think about maybe a softer visual element.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for comment.</p>
<p>Jeo324
I&rsquo;m definitely going to try out what you said. The backpack idea is really great. Thanks !</p>

[[http://www.core77.com/blog/book_reviews/book_review_new_skateboard_graphics_by_j_namdev_hardisty_13032.asp|Skate design]], at this late stage, is very diverse. Maybe there is a way to do something that doesn&rsquo;t feel old but also doesn&rsquo;t look as bold as a package for beef jerky.</p>
<p>Also consider the usage situation. Logos for climbing gear brands often are incorporated into zipper pulls, at the base of a neck on a jacket, etc. and are sometimes embroidered.</p>
<p>My quick take on authentic but also fun FWIW.</p>

Seriously, what&rsquo;s the target audience on this? (Except for Belgian.)</p>
<p>It is extremely literal, and I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the best thing to do.
FWIW, I keep seeing a huge footprint in snow, kinda like on the cover of the Tintin in Tibet book. IIRC there&rsquo;s an even better picture of it inside the book. That might make for a bit of a Jack Wolfskin parody though :)</p>

<p>@jupiterboy:  I agree (if i understood correctly) that there might be too much detail on the yeti for a logo.. but when i put it in small the details are less seen but its still understood that its a yeti (i think).  I did think about what it would look like on clothes and in packaging and thats why i went in this direction too, i thought i might be able to have more fun with it .. Skate style but i might be wrong. Thanks again for your advice and your little trial :)</p>
<p>@evanbron: Hey thanks for your comment number three might be the right way to go. And for the borders I&rsquo;m trying out some things at the moment. I&rsquo;ll post them later it would be great if you could let me know what you think about them once they are up!</p>
<p>@altaira:  This is a project for my final year jury. So its not actually going to be done unless the company wants to buy it off me. The group that created this brand are 4 quite young flemish guys that are all about the outdoor. They actually kinda look like the yeti :) same attitude at least. Also with the &ldquo;mean&rdquo; yeti I&rsquo;m trying to pass the idea of toughness. The group do events as well&hellip; like climbing the Mont Blanc.. its not for anybody. The age group is between 17 till late 30&rsquo;s and older if your still fit enough.<br>
I tired a few things with a yeti foot. But it was even more literal that doing a yeti&hellip; and gave off less attitude.  The foot prints from Tintin are to cartoon like I find, but I am working on a yeti version more like the yeti in that comic. Thanks for the comments!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One problem with rendering a Yeti is that no one has seen one, or at least the general publics’ impression is the backside of a lumbering ape creature. What you have has an infant like proportion (baby head), like a young orangutan that has an angry or maybe pouting expression.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of what is required to survive at high altitudes, which isn’t so much toughness or anger as good decision making skills under extreme stress. I still believe there is a self-reliance angle that is being missed.</p>
<p>Most productive logo crit threads start out with four or five distinct ideas. You have versions of the same idea with minor changes.</p>

But this isn&rsquo;t an illustration forum, it&rsquo;s a type forum, so let&rsquo;s talk about type. The cameo around the Yeti dictates a centered layout, but when the type is mechanically centered, <strong>OUTDOOR</strong> looks wrong because of the shape of the. <strong>Y</strong>, so you ended up moving <strong>OUTDOOR</strong> to the right.
Maybe you could replace the cameo with a border around the whole logo? 
<img src="/images/old-images/YETI_5598.jpg" alt="">
The border draws the eye away from the shape of the <strong>Y</strong>, so <strong>OUTDOOR</strong> can be centered and still look right.</div>

What if you take away the white eye? It looks a little zombie to me, and wouldn&rsquo;t show if it was in shadow.</p>

What about a shield? Would have a mountain connotation. I like the head busting out of the top as above.</p>

<p>but maybe with the layout in tact , there needs to be no border , leaving it all open also giving alternative layout options.</p>
<p>example you might just used the yeti face for stickers, and also have the version with the text aligned to the right of the face for those pesky situations in which the logo needs a more landscape format to sit nicely in a given composition.</p>

<p>You could also incorporate a more organic/nature-y feel by turing the frame into a branch, perhaps? A suggestion of a leaf or two could go a long way.</p>
<p>I played with it a bit, just to hopefully spark some direction.</p>

I have taken into consideration most of the comments but I have to say I do personally favor the mean looking character out of all the other ones I have done.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m usually a lurker here&hellip;..but I climb (alot), so I thought I might weigh in a little on your logo.  A comment was made about the type of design being used in climbing (bad or too serious) and I agree to a point (Mammut&rsquo;s logo is great).  The bouldering scene (one form of climbing) leans towards the skate style, and sport climbing is getting there, traditional climbing is a little more/over serious.  I guess I am trying to say that there are 3 major divisions in climbing and they are each marketed very differently.  Ive also noticed a difference between companies that make gear (hardware) and companies that make colthes (software).</p>
<p>I like the mean yeti, number three in particular.  I agree that it could probably use something else containing it, rectangle or a shield, but I think it works and could work cross &ldquo;genre&rdquo;? if handled well.</p>
<p>Nice Logo.</p>
