I&rsquo;m seeking for ideas and opinions on allusive typography. I&rsquo;m creating a book on the history of ballet and thought about using a Typeface from the Romantic period. So I chose Bodoni, an Italian Type with Romantic characteritics. This would be for the body of the text. Then I was really thinking in using titles in Baskerville, even though it&rsquo;s a Baroque and English Typeface. You see, to my eyes they would match but I&rsquo;m thinking if my boss would find it too bold.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you think that they were more inspired by the entirety of the work he was doing as opposed to his typefaces, per se? I mean Baskervilled was exploring the new paper that could hold the sharper serif. Perhaps they, Bodoni and Didot, were more interested in that fact than the typefaces. Yes, I&rsquo;m speculating. But it seems to me they had in their minds something different which would take advantage of the advances which  Baskerville was making in paper technology.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember the story. So, I could be wrong, but it seems to me that either Bodoni went on a trip toward meeting Baskerville or one of the Didots. But, they became sick and had to return. This ring any bells?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re repressing the memory.  ;-)
It was Bodoni. He was in awe of Baskerville, and decided to go to him. He got sick on the way, before he even left Italy. Who knows what might [not] have happened if he had made it?</p>

<p>I think relative to his society he was actually much more bullish.
Note how he was ostracized by his peers, while the continentals were not.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Just my personal thoughts, but I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest placing two serifed faces together on a design for the simple fact that they are too close (design-wise) to one another. There wouldn&rsquo;t be enough constrast between the two faces to look intentional. Both faces, in my opinion, are gorgeous and you could achieve that traditional, romantic, classical look that it seems you are going for, but placing them together would look like a mistake. Perhaps using different weights of the same font, i.e. regular with an italic, or just using a serif with a clean, sophisticated sans serif. One that comes to mind is Helvetica Nueue.</div>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to put some of my thoughts here too, but please, bare in mind that I may say some really newbie-dumbish things.</p>
<p>Considering it&rsquo;s a book about the history of ballet, which inevitably will be associated with &lsquo;classics&rsquo; (music, art, whatever), I can understand the choice for a romantic type&hellip; and serifs.</p>
<p>Mixing serif with sans-serif seem a little like breaking the &lsquo;classic&rsquo; mood of the book.</p>
<p>I always associated sans-serif with realist, modernist and post.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m too stuck with Robert Bringhurst saying something like a perfect type would be &lsquo;invisible&rsquo;&hellip; would just &lsquo;honor the text&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, maybe serif and sans would bring too much attention to the type&hellip; a little too much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not arguing, complaining, accusing or anything like that&hellip; I&rsquo;m just trying to broad my mind&hellip; a little.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My view, Lucien, is that the Bringhurst/Noordzij view of Bodoni as a typographic Romantic, his forms whimsically calligraphic, is not only unhelpful but willfully paradoxical. Firstly, Bodoni&rsquo;s mature letterforms are duller than all contemporary forms excepting the Didots'. One need only examine any competent writing or engraving of the period to confirm this. Secondly, the larval Bodoni followed first the slaphead clumsiness of the rationalist, deist (not Baroque) Baskerville, who, unable to make type himself, could not learn even to judge it: his lc a is too fat, and his patronising disparagement of Caslon absurd. Thirdly, Bodoni cut punches for specific uses, making his work more like lettering than our ideal of infinitely combinable type. That his text sizes were not so specifically varied is irrelevant, because Bodoni famously sought only magnificence and knew nothing of sweetness in the mass. His texts were faulty and his whitespace unfunctional; he was not a typographer so much as a graphic designer. This matters because Romanticism is, when successful, the mode of the mobile consciousness, and the progessing sentence: the paragraph, or book, rather than the title page. Bodoni cared more for titles than for text. The most genuinely Romantic type designs are those like Deepdene, the letters of which are perhaps too dramatic taken individually, but which combine to very subtle effect.</p>

<p>Although your points against Baskerville are suspect: maybe his &ldquo;a&rdquo; was a bit chunky*, but there are worse things; and Caslon was indeed a hack. The only real problem in Baskerville&rsquo;s type is that the italic is completely botched - and nobody has managed to really make it work&hellip; yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>The &ldquo;a&rdquo; in the Monotype revival being unfairly horsey.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Baskerville&rsquo;s italic is indeed pretty pointless, his spaced italic caps doubly so. But it&rsquo;s the gradual loss of understanding of relative proportions within a font from Baskerville to Bodoni that really saddens me, along with the ascendancy of high contrast presswork. Fournier&rsquo;s type is much better, but I don&rsquo;t know whether there&rsquo;s a good digital Fournier out there. Is there?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve thickened the ear on g - thanks - and there are more letters in need of criticism, should anyone wish to turn the tables on my intemperance, <a href="http://typophile.com/node/15249">here</a></p>

		<div class="commentbody">In my humble&hellip;Whatever, Baskerville and Bodoni are, and no matter who got sick, if used at grossly different sizes, like ¡24 and 9.6!, and as long as they are &ldquo;proper&rdquo; &ldquo;text&rdquo; and &ldquo;display&rdquo; versions, and as long as there&rsquo;s practically nothing else but dancers, they should be FINE together. Brilliant even, sans and dance not being terribly appeti zing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As David says, proper text and display versions, but it would also be good to have some idea that connects the two.</p>
<p>For instance, Holiday magazine in the 1950s used to have heads in Bauer Bodoni, and text in Times, both of which had a similar quality of contrast and sharpness.</p>
<p>So a way of making the combo work might be to match up different versions of the text Bodoni and display Baskerville, and see if any interesting relationships appear. Of course that does depend on having printed specimens &ndash; the FontBook is useful. And I don&rsquo;t know if you have any particular cuts of the two faces you&rsquo;re committed to working with, Lucien.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I really like Hrant&rsquo;s idea of using the Bodoni (a display cut, of course) for titling. But I&rsquo;m not sure what the text should be. You could experiment a bit with some different faces, and you could always come back to Bodoni for text. Then again, you may want to try something French for a book on the history of ballet. Seems appropriate, but I do like Bodoni for this kind of project.</div>
