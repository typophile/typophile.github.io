  I am having some problems.\r\n\r\n1. when I check the feature in FontLab 4.6, it
  raises all the glyphs following the one I want raised.\r\nfeature vkrn {  pos \\uni053B
  \\uni055E 120;} vkrn; should raise one \\uni055E when it is after \\uni053B, but
  everything that comes after it is also raised.\r\n\r\n2. I cannot get it to work
  outside FontLab. The feature should be on by default, but I don't know how to do
  it.\r\n\r\nAnyone knows how to resolve these problems?\r\n"

    this:\r\n<code>pos \\uni053B \\uni055E &lt;0 120 0 0&gt;;</code>\r\n\r\nhttp://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#2.e.iv"

  body: "The <vkrn> feature is intended for use in vertical setting of East Asian
    scripts. It is not intended for raising or lowering glyphs in the context of horizontal
    text. The feature is not applied by any applications outside of vertical setting
    of East Asian text, e.g. in the Japanese version of InDesign.\r\n\r\nIf you want
    to contextually raise or lower glyphs in horizontal text, you should use the normal
    <kern> feature. I'm not sure if you can do this with FontLab, though, because
    of the limitation that you encoutered. You can do it with the MS VOLT tool."

  body: "Thanks John.\r\n\r\nBut I have a problem. First, I am creating OT-CFF fonts.
    MS VOLT says it is for TT fonts.\r\nSecond, I am using a Mac not a PC, and MS
    VOLT is a PC app.\r\n\r\nIs there a Mac app. that will work with CFF fonts? Maybe
    from Adobe?"

    current OT generation is built on the Adobe FDK code.\r\n\r\nYou can run VOLT
    under Windows emulation on the Mac.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use VOLT to develop
    CFF fonts. See my old Typophile post No.510 in this thread: http://typophile.com/node/13042#comment-75498\r\n\r\n{link
