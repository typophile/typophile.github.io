  body: I can attest that his book is worth the purchase. I bought a copy last year
    and read it in one sitting. Very entertaining. I think it could even be used--for
    the most part--as a way to educate the young typophile. :^&#41; Thanks for sharing

  body: I bought the book about a month ago and read it right after finishing &#34;Alpha
    Beta&#34; &#40;a contrast in style&#41;.  Alessio&#39;s book is a scream yet very
    good information.  It is a very quick read and will make your day with a broad
    smile.  It is sort of like having Father Guido Sarducci &#40;old SNL character&#41;
    teaching history of letterforms.  Alessio is a guy I just have to meet.  I at
    least owe him an email for writing such a fun book. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    it from Alessio&#39;s site listed at the top. &#40;buymyfonts.com&#41;

  body: Definitly buy it from Alessio.  You get a personal note from him which is
    worth a chuckle alone.
