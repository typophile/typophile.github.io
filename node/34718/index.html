<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello, I'm a new individual font designer. I'm creating new writing systems, new "alphabets" if you will, and want to create an easy to use font that will allow people to write with those new alphabets by simply installing the font on their computer.
Here's what happened, I drew the glyphs in Adobe Illustrator CS2, and I need to draw them in that software and not in a font-editing/making software because the glyphs in question have to be very accurate and well-drawn which would take forever using the limited tools in font-creating software. So I drew them in Illustrator, but when I try to import them into Font Creator 5 or Fontographer 4.1, they distort the vector art or rasterize it. I tried everything, importing it as EPS in Fontographer (but it causes the program to crash)...
How can I import or copy-paste a vector drawing/glyph into a font creating program without it distorting the vector art? What font program should I use? Should I get Font Creator Pro or maybe something else? Is there a free font editing program that can do this?
Thank you very much in advance guys. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Fontographer could always easily import Illustrator files as long as they were measured correctly, each letter being the same height. A good easy intro on how to do this is <a href=http://www.chank.com/howto/index.php>here</a> Chank was one of the original guys who introduced fonts to the Internet world and is still working. There are of course many other places to look for info. If I were you I would, if you haven't already, download from FontLab the manuals and or demo programs for Fontographer or FontLab or better yet, for the beginner, TypeTool 3, also from FontLab, an inexpensive yet very powerful program. Without seeing an example of the font you are attempting to create it is difficult to understand where the problem is but I suspect that the outlines of the glyphs are very complex, which can cause problems. If you can, put up a gif or pdf file of the work you are doing so readers can get an idea of what is going on. Not familiar with Font Creator 5. And given the tools available in the font creation programs I use, TypeTool 3, Fontog, FontLab Studio I don't see why you couldn't create the fonts directly in those programs. But for clarity the contributors to Typophle probably need to see something.
Good luck

<div class=commentbody>FontLab and Fontographer are both much more accurate than Illustrator.
BTW, maybe we see your invented alphabet(s)?

<div class=commentbody>More accurate* in getting the glyph in the font in your head into beziers.

Hmmmmm. :) I assume you don't mean "numerically"... what do you mean exactly?
To the OP: "VERY IMPORTANT PLEASE HELP!!" is a really really bad subject line for a post. You'll get a better response if you summarise what you are really asking. I can't speak for others, but I don't normally read any post that doesn't give a clue to itself in the subject line (it's almost always a waste of time, obviously).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ah OK. I recently re-read the <a href=/node/33531>thread</a> on Raph's prototype Cornu editor (weird, searching for 'cornu' does not find anything). Is anyone doing anything with it?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Here it is, handwritten. If you see it on its actual size, it's very well-written but the zoom magnifies the inevitable errors made during handwriting. Needless to say, as a font it needs to be 100% accurate. This is even more the case when the writing system has it's letters/glyphs connected to each other.

I have found on the Fontlab Studio page that it supports importing Illustrator data (.ai and .eps), I have tried the demo version: the import worked succesfully. I am currently downloading Fontlab Studio retail. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Your examples are so small it's hard to see much of anything. But, it looks like you found the answer as far as software is concerned.</div>
