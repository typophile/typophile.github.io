  Vinyl Fonts is happy to introduce Darlena!\r\n\r\nDarlena is a swashed typeface
  that is perfect for grabbing attention. Influenced by Italian calligraphy from the
  late 1500\u2019s, with modern serifs thrown in.\r\n\r\nAvailable here:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/darlena/\r\nhttp://www.fontspring.com/fonts/blue-vinyl-fonts/darlena"

    drawing plain caps and going bonkers with OpenType substitution.
