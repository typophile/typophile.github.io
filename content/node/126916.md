  body: "Looks very familiar, but your sample is too low res to get a decent ID through
    font recognition software.\r\n\r\nIf this is screen capped from a website, can
    you provide the base URL? (No deep links to any personal information, please.)
    \ If the typeface is used widely on the site, I can look at the code and tell
    you what it is."
