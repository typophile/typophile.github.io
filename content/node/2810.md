body: 'This topic has come up before but... I&#39;m still confused. <BR> <BR>I have
  a font with six weights: <BR>Stratum-Thin <BR>Stratum-Light <BR>Stratum-Regular
  <BR>Stratum-Medium <BR>Stratum-Bold <BR>Stratum-Black <BR> <BR>How do I make them
  appear under one menu name <BR>and also be completely cross platform compatible?
  <BR> <BR>I know I need to style link them but... <BR>I&#39;m unclear as how to do
  it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve studied Brioso Pro and Warnock Pro <BR>but I&#39;ve only come
  up dry. I understand <BR>FDK is at work but it should be possible <BR>with FL right?
  <BR> <BR>Any help would be great appreciated. <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Eric O.'

  body: AFAIK, in FL&#39;s Font Info window, in the &#39;OpenType-specific font names&#39;
    window, you need to enter &#39;Stratum&#39; as the &#39;Family Name&#39;, and
    the requisite style as the &#39;Style Name&#39;. The info in the &#39;Basic set
    of font names&#39; window should be entered as usual. &#40;I.e., with four weights
    per family.&#41; This has always worked in Photoshop, InDesign, etc. for me.

  body: Thanks for posting this John. <BR>Unfortunately, I&#39;m still not finding
    sucess. <BR> <BR>Curiously I&#39;m able to get the fonts to work under <BR>Word
    but not the usually forgiving Adobe apps.  <BR>Very strange. <BR>

    both platforms under all programs including <BR>the nasty ones like Word.

  body: You see the funny thing is... <BR>I&#39;m not really sure what I did. <BR>
    <BR>I followed Adam&#39;s instructions but used <BR>the Style Name &#34;Regular&#34;
    for the first <BR>four weights and the Style Name &#34;Bold&#34;  <BR>for the
    next two weights. It works fine but <BR>I wonder how this would work in a more
    <BR>in depth family with say 20 variations? <BR> <BR>My fonts all show up with
    the specified  <BR>names and organize themselves in the <BR>menus nicely. I should
    add that the <BR>third window &#34;Additional OpenType Names&#34; <BR>is pretty
    important and seems to be part <BR>of the OpenType naming puzzle. Again, <BR>I
    followed Adam&#39;s instructions for this  <BR>window and everything is working
    fine. <BR> <BR>I hope this makes some sense... <BR> <BR>I would love to hear how
    others do this.
