  body: "Brandon Grotesque.\r\n\r\n(Tip: It's easier for us if you always link to
    websites you need font ID:s from. Not necessarily needed \u2013 in this case for
    instance Brandon is one of the top-selling indie fonts in the world and pops up
    often enough here \u2013 but often it's extremely helpful because it allows us
    to look in the source code or use plugins to find the font on the page.)"
