And even then, you can never catch the Concorde. So, in the end, it's really a labor of love. And I mean that in the best possible way. I have bills too, but I always try to remember that they're evil. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, Stephen, is the Bitstream deal perpetual?

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I must admit, I did my research on font publisher's payments a few years ago when I was submitting designs. (I was only successfull once - selling Eastwood to ITC: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=1X7VX1BE6C8S9KPC544DAL9CEE500439&amp;amp;sku=ITC2126">http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.asp?sid=1X7VX1BE6C8S9KPC544DAL9CEE500439&amp;amp;sku=ITC2126</a><!-- raw HTML omitted -->) (If anyone wants to know the story of the font, how long it took to make and how much money it has made so far then by all means email me.) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Perhaps I had, by then, learnt to attune my design submissions to ITC's sensibilities. But also, by that time I was tired of my work falling on deaf ears - so to speak - and I gave up.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I could come out with a new font once a month then $2500 or $2000 might be attractive. We all know though that this work rate is unrealistic.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also, like every other type designer who ever lived I was self-taught and had to learn everything the hard way, including the commercial side of the profession. Unfortunately I found that all too often, other type designers were simply coy about the commercial aspect of their work and would never get into conversations on the nitty gritty details about how much they were paid for particular fonts and how long the work took. This secrecy seems to continue today, and it remains a mystery to me how online font publishers such as Chank, Larabie et al make enough money to justify the work. I'm quite certain that font design is subsidized by the other professional work such graphic designers do, and is not really a viable economic concern in and of itself. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sorry that the discussion has gone off topic. I'm new to this forum and just took the opportunity to bring up this subject.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, every case is different, and people mean different things by &quot;living&quot; in &quot;earn a living&quot;&hellip; But I think you've hit the nail on the head about &quot;subsidizing&quot;: Chank for example sells paintings on e-bay for a lot of money. In my case, I'm a Macromedia Director developer, and even with the crappy economy my de facto hourly rate (as opposed to the rate I quote my clients) is pretty high.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant! - You're right. I think these designers are effectively their own &quot;patrons&quot; or &quot;sponsors&quot;. They have a real income from other sources which subsidizes the labor of love that is type design.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The number of type designers in the world that make enough money to call it their sole profession (that's not the best definition, but hopefully you understand what I mean) is probably less than twenty. (And if we put our heads together we could probably come up with a list of exactly who those people are.)  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would be willing to bet that they can only say that because they are the sort of elite graphic designer who gets commisioned for a new font for a magazine or newspaper - NOT because they make so much money on retail sales of their fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(By the way, I am not referring to lettering artists. Strictly designers of fonts available to buy retail.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This can get interesting. But let's clarify <!-- raw HTML omitted -->things a bit. Am I correct in assuming that: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. The List contains those who make *most* of their living from their own type designs (not lettering, not anything else), be it custom or retail. (I think we can all agree that virtually nobody can survive on just retail). <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Fame has nothing to do with it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If so, Black and Spiekermann I don't think are on there. Zapf is hard to tell these days. Licko is probably that side of the border (she was commissioned -using the term somewhat loosely- for Journal, I think). Shinn is unlikely (as much as I like his stuff). Unger is a strong contender (but note that he teaches). Tankard definitely. Quay I don't think. Also, Miles Newlyn might be a possibility, but I don't know what he's up to lately. And Tobias Frere-Jones is probably in there. David Berlow might be, if he doesn't make too much money outside his own type designs. And don't forget the Dutch Twins (even though they bend the definition of &quot;type&quot; - good for them). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->BTW, another great on-line source for designers (and others in related fields) is: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Person">http://www.myfonts.com/Person</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You can also search by &quot;Activity&quot;, like: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Activity1.html">http://www.myfonts.com/Activity1.html</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So here's my &quot;cut&quot;: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Matthew Carter <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tobias Frere-Jones <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jonathan Hoefler <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jean-François Porchez <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeremy Tankard <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Erik van Blokland <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just van Rossum <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gerard Unger <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sorry for not really growing it&hellip;  :-/ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If we're lucky, I'm wrong.

Maybe he does commissions too. So there's a tentative yes. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Zapf at, what is it, 85 could still walk into most any big corporation and they'd hire him as a  consultant.

		<div class="commentbody">Stephen: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think we shouldn't go hypothetical - it's too distracting. As for the &quot;corporation&quot; aspect you bring up, that's definitely something to consider, but only case-by-case. I have to agree with Martin, and restate that -to me at least- the most useful question to [try to] answer here is: who makes most of their living from sales of their own designs? In the case of FB, it's difficult to say who gets how much of what (I'm sure some of you know, though); in the case of Emigre, it's clearer (see below); and in the case of HTF, although it's getting less clear, it's still relatively very clear: Hoefler's library is mostly his - he's the one who worked on  the bulk of the designs, and he's the one who gets most of the cash. TFJ is his partner now (but an equal partner?), so that makes it trickier, but I don't think HTF is really a &quot;font house&quot;, so I suspect TFJ gets most of the money from his own designs. Insiders please correct me if I'm wrong. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the case of Emigre, I have to ask: fonts designed by *whom*? In the past three years Licko has designed one new font family. And surely RvL doesn't live off of Suburban&hellip; Like most font houses, Emigre gives between 10-20% royalties to its designers, and the rest could be enough to make a living (although less and less with each passing day), but to me that's really beside the point: we're talking about investing time designing type, not leveraging a powerful brand to profit from the design work of others, as smart as that is (or at least used to be). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>
