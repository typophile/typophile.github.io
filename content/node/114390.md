  from the 1950s are available digitally.\r\n\r\nAny info as to whether they have
  been, and by who gratefully received.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nMike"

    metal ornaments, but nothing spoke of digital versions. Sounds like a great project
    for a designer with time on their hands and specimens of the originals.\r\n\r\n-
