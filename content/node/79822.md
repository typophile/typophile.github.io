body: "Can some one help identify this Font, I need to get as close as possible for
  a picky client.\r\n\r\nIts not Vag Rounded, Arial Rounded or Helvetica Rounded,
  All have been rejected as well as a few free fonts like Plump and Franks Reg.\r\n\r\nSorry
  about the wafty picture, the sample is foil blocked and my phone camera doesn't
  \ like the reflection. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"
