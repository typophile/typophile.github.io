  body: "Thank you for this beautiful holiday surprise!\r\n\r\nI'd like to make a
    small suggestion - the files (specimen and opentype/character pdf's)  that are
    uniquely associated with a font file should be uniquely named. For example, in
    this case, ALOTGutenbergASpec.pdf and ALOTGutenbergAchar.pdf. In that way, people
    who choose to keep multiple fonts and related files in a folder will not have
    name conflicts, and would be able to see at a glance what the asociated files
    refer to.\r\n\r\nThank you again.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    year.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/al_logo_5019.png]\r\nP.S.: I have
    followed HVB's suggestion regarding PDF file names for every released font, and
    (as time permits) I will implement it for sample image files (JPG/PNG) too. Thanks
    again."
