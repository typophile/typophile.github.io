  body: "As Butthead would say: \"Hey, you're paying attention.\"  :-)\r\n\r\nIt's
    nice to see an effort like this. But know that it's hard to pull off, not least
    in terms of getting it into an actual font as opposed to Photoshop images...\r\n\r\nTwo-pixel
    stems seem to make sense above 14-15 ppem. You're at 16, but your x-height is
    pretty small, so you're pushing it a little bit, and some people will think it's
    too dark. On the other hand, some people will object to somewhat dark fonts all
    the time, so... The good news is that at that ppem (and even with a smallish x-height)
    you want 2 pixels of interletter spacing* and that will open things up. You might
    end up making a one-pixel weight as a companion (and it could actually serve for
    emphasis the way an italic does in print) but don't easily give up the darkness.\r\n\r\n*
    BTW, in bitmap fonts the spacing is very deeply woven into the black forms, so
    you really have to mind both in parallel, perhaps even more so than in outline
    fonts. In that way (and maybe otherwise, such as freeing the mind as to what's
    possible) starting off in type design on the bitmap side might actually be beneficial...\r\n\r\nYour
    lc structures are sound (the \"y\" is quite nice) and your vertical proportions
    are very good for text. Try to make your \"v\" and \"w\" narrower - maybe by making
    their bases two pixels. Your caps and your application of grays I would work on
    though. Concerning the former, I would try making the caps wider; concerning the
    latter: avoid \"hanging\" light grays - they might seem clever, but mostly they
    just add blur; try to have a lighter touch in places, like the bottom of the \"g\";
    and don't be afraid of using more shades - eight is a decent palette. I do see
    you're trying to lighten things up by making half of the stems a lighter black!
    I've experimented with that, and I do think it can work (although your lighter
    black is a bit too dark) but since you say you're just starting I'd be more conservative
    and just make things solid for now. In fact I can tell you're trying to apply
    every single idea you've had (I know because I suffer from the same temptation)
    but such a utopian approach always backfires in type design...\r\n\r\nBTW, some
    people will tell you (sometimes through their silence...) that you're wasting
    your time making something like this. But to me, especially since OSX has gone
    the What<em>ever</em> route of font rendering something like this makes even more
    sense than before.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I don't see the point (probably not the only one). Unless it's something that's
    going to be used on some custom device burned inside an EPROM and used on matrix
    display.\r\n\r\nIt's not sensible these days (however you look at it) to do this
    kind of stuff for computers. But I may be just so way off everything that I don't
    really understand where OSX is going as hrant says... <cite>(since I'm a Windows
    user)</cite>"

  body: but hrant... Sorry for not knowing this, but I assumed that OSX also uses
    some sort of ClearType font-rendering technology? Or are you maybe talking about
    MacOS that really still is here and probably does still have bitmap fonts?
