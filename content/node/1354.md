    <BR> <BR>We had this one quite recently on the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/7876.html?1064077824"

  body: Uh oh. I&#39;m way off again. Well it&#39;s 6.00pm now and not so great for
    type id-ing too, I guess. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Neuland either.

  body: It&#39;s not exactly that, but Neuland certainly was the  <BR>source material
    to develop the movie&#39;s title. Check  <BR>which different versions/digitizations
    exist. The  <BR>one by <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/jungle-fever-nf/jungle-fever-nf/testdrive.html?s=Jurassic%20Park&amp;p=48"

  body: Nonono, you&#39;ve got it back to front, David. If  <BR>anything the Jurassic
    Park logo was first. It&#39;s not  <BR>uncommon that <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/15918.html?1063247603"
    target="_blank"> knock-off fonts based on movie</a> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/15918.html?1063247603"
    target="_blank">  logos</a> pop up whenever such movies get popular.  <BR>Furthermore
    the <i>African</i> font looks like a rip-off of  <BR><i>Neuland Inline</i>, not
    of the Jurassic Park logo.

    is</a>. Though, as it seems, they now only provide an ID when it&#39;s a commercial
    font. <BR>Nice move on their part &#40;though I have to say I think some foundry
    must have sent them the standard cease-and-desist&#41;.

    more condensed than the sample above. See for yourself :D <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16793.gif"
