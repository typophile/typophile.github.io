  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I often want to comment on the type in movies on my blog, but Apple's OS screen capturing won't work when iDVD is playing, and I don't like giving long descriptions when a single image will do much better. Can anyone suggest any apps (the cheaper the better, but I'm willing to pay for it) that will ignore this restriction and allow me to capture stills from DVDs I'm playing on my mac?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">it has to do with how the video is being played at the system level so the capture program isn't the issue. Also, when you say iDVD I assume you mean DVD Player...

You need to use a different player, try VLC, it is free and it plays almost every format, and you can take standard screenshots while watching vids.

Rob, Yes, I meant DVD player. It's become a habit to append 'i's on Apple iProducts. See? I can't stop. I've actually already got VLC for AVIs, so I'll give that a try, too. Though what I'm really interested in is a screen capture app with no restrictions.

Thanks!</div>

I hadn't tried taking a screen capture with dvd player on 10.4 yet. I didn't realize that it actually inhibited you from taking the picture. I remember, back in the day, being able to make a capture, but the dvd window would be black— that was probably a limitation of the video card in my powerbook though.

In any case, snapz pro does work and so does this free dashboard widget.

As for the copyright issue, for review/analysis purposes, you're fine with the law. As to whether your fine with MPAA 7-figured-salaried-lawyer-hounds, who knows? ;o)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Snapz Pro can do it. That's what I've been using lately. 

The ones in my Typecasting series were done over several years. The earliest ones were done with a VCR hooked up to an AV-input-equiped Mac and the Apple Video Player (pre OS X) with which you could use command-C (Copy) to grab a frame. Most of the later ones were done with VLC. It works okay, but navigation was kind of tricky (maybe it's better now--I haven't tried the latest version recently). Snapz Pro lets you get frames from the Apple DVD Player, which I prefer because performance and navigation are better than VLC (assuming it hasn't gotten better since the last time I used it). Even so, the video card may prevent it in some models. (I think it has to support Quartz Extreme or something.)</div>
