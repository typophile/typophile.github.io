  body: I think it's pretty sweet! Plus it is maybe not too late to sell to 1000's
    of design studios not wanting to be utterly me too with a VAG rounded 'web two
    point oh' look. Nick! You had better get your rounded font out now before the
    fashion trend is over. ;-) The one thing that is wacky is the way the character
    changes with the caps & lc. I don't quite know what I think about that. Stephen
    your right Burin Sans is sweet too. But those tasty CAPs on Bryant are still my
    fave.

  body: This might well be genius. VAG, AG Rounded, Helvetica Rounded, etc. get their
    most of their personality from the round corners, so none really stands out to
    anyone who isn't a fan of German cars. Gotham Rounded is going to look SO much
    cooler.

    is the slab serif version coming out? ;-)

    by [[Joshua Darden]]. \r\n\r\n[Edit: That didn't really answer your question,
    Stephen. I'd say that based on the popularity of Gotham it could be very popular.
    However, the fact that the rounded (aka Web 2.0, as you mentioned) look has been
    around for a while perhaps it won't be quite as hot as the parent. I like how
    you identify it as a draftsman alphabet, it is very straight forward and perhaps
    that will be one thing it has over the other rounded sans available. Either way,
    the market is saturated, IMHO, and perhaps this completes it. (Although I see
    Nick has something coming out so perhaps I should hold my tongue.)]"

  body: i'm afraid Gotham Rounded will just give the already-prevalent rounded sans
    trend a boost. I've wanted to do a small article for you on this trend, but i've
    been too busy walking the talk to write anything, sorry. :(
