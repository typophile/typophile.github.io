    definitely <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/coronet-rr/bold/testdrive.html?s=T%2B%2BW%2BC&amp;p=96">Coronet
    Bold</a> caps, but you could try something common like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/park-avenue/park-avenue/testdrive.html?s=T%2BW%2BC&amp;p=96">Park
    Avenue</a> if you&#39;re simply trying to approximate the feel.'

  body: Grant, I think he might be right about the &#39;C&#39;. I don&#39;t  <BR>have
    time to double-check, but it&#39;s possibly not Coronet.
