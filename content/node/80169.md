  body: "> frode frank\r\n\r\nWhen I meant \"pointy all the way\" I meant the tip
    of the \"N\" & tops of the \"A\" stays at a sharp point even in the heavier weights.
    Sorry if that was confusing! \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks so much for both of your suggestions!
    Very kind of you to reply! I will look into those immidiately!\r\n\r\nIn the mean
    time if anyone thinks of anything else I am definitely open to as much help as
    I can get, so a big thank you to those who take the time to read & reply!"

    btw?

  body: If you are familiar with vector drawing, making a pointy N is not a lot of
    work. If just for the logo.

  body: ">Frode Frank\r\n\r\nI would love to go with Brandon Grotesque! But it doesn't
    have small caps and they are so set on that. I think I'm going to come up with
    some alternatives though because i don't think the small caps look right... \r\n\r\nYou
    are right however that constructing the pointy N would be fine, but we wanted
    to have the font available for multiple uses in different weights and I wanted
    it to all look consistent.\r\n\r\nThanks again for all your tips and suggestions!
    You have no idea how much I've appreciated it."

  body: If criteria is for sharp pointed "A" and "N", take a look at my [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeinnovations/contax-pro/|Contax
    Pro]] sans serif font family. It also has real small caps.

    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/relay_ot/?affid=99346">Relay</a>
    have enough weights that you might be able to emulate small caps by using a heavier
    font for the smaller letters. Just have to match it right.
