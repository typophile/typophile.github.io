  known as a beak serif ...but I've been wrong before.\r\n\r\nTiffany is as close

    mentioned in a previous post that you had a print shop with old type. Is this
    image from a digital font of our era, or a print from old metal type?\r\nIf it's
    digital, some digging could turn up your font. Perhaps by a Polish foundry? http://luc.devroye.org/poland-index.html\r\nDon"
