body: I&#39;m working on a project right now that is in a very conceptual stage, and
  very abstract, so I&#39;m trying to get some input to steer  this in an appropriate
  direction. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working to build what I&#39;m calling &#34;beatmaps&#34;
  right now.  It is to be a linear transcription of music &#40;mainly experimental
  electronic or electro acoustics&#41; presenting harmony, dissonance, meter, and
  syncopation with only punctuation and letter forms.  It isn&#39;t to be readable...the
  letters are only to represent sound through their visual presence.  Color choices
  will also be a large issue in defining the melodic atmosphere. <BR> <BR>Think about
  it like looking at sheet music, but instead of seeing black and white dot and flag
  characters, you find colorful typographic fragments arranged so you SEE the music
  as plainly as you would hear it. <BR> <BR>Vague, I know.  Abstract, I know.  I&#39;m
  only typing this little bit of info so we can think about the wide possibilities
  here.  If your musically attuned I&#39;d really appreciate any things you can give
  me to consider, any visual ideas, or good references. <BR> <BR>-JT

  body: 'Robert Bringhurst has an abiding interest in what he calls typographic polyphony,
    i.e. the representation of multiple, simultaneous or contrapuntal voices in type.
    It is difficult to do convincingly, as Robert is the first to admit, largely because
    reading is an isolating process. Polyphonic texts are appreciated only as wholes:
    as soon as one starts to read the polyphony stops, as when one tries to pick out
    a particular instrument or voice in polyphonic music. That said, poly-typographic
    compositions can be visually very dramatic and exciting. One of my favourite such
    images, which Robert shows in some of his illustrated lectures, is of a heavily
    graffiti&#39;d highway underpass in LA, in which multiple layers of tagging interact.
    <BR> <BR>All this is a lengthy pre-amble to my suggestion that, in your attempt
    to represent music typographically, you may have an easier and more direct route
    to the kind of visual polyphony that interests Robert than the more common attempt
    to represent text musically.'

  body: Thanks John, <BR> <BR>I certainly haven&#39;t looked into Bringhurst&#39;s
    writing enough, and I didn&#39;t realize he treated music.  It makes sense, with
    his poetic experience.  I&#39;m not finding much online about his though...just
    links to his books, and one interview that didn&#39;t get too interesting.  Any
    info online you know of? <BR> <BR>It might be a trip to the library for me.

  body: 'I&#39;m not aware of any written work by Robert that really deals with the
    &#39;typographic polyphony&#39; topic, although there are some examples of his
    attempts to produce such work, e.g. his poem for several voices <i>The blue roofs
    of Japan</i> and the more recent <a href="http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/item.asp?N=35&amp;R=1559107&amp;act=A03&amp;Item=978189403166&amp;Section=books&amp;Catalog=Books&amp;Lang=en&amp;mscssid=XV4TWKKWJNRQ9K58LTL93AW2R1XF2W0C&amp;WSID=130497E96690691842A2A72FDFB184E370153120"><i>Ursa

    anything online.'
