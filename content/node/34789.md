  body: "PBS was designed by Ed Benguiat.\r\nThe sample looks like it may be a page
    from an old U&Lc\r\n\r\nand therefore...perhaps a Benguiat piece in itself...\r\n\r\nJust
    a thought.\r\n\r\n(You know, U&Lc - Upper & Lower case newspaper owned by ITC
    - International Typeface Co. -- and all those ties to Photolettering - home to
    many greats - like Benguiat and Lubalin."
