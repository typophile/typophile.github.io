body: I&#39;ve been seeing different versions of Futura Medium; some with very tall
  ascenders, and some with not so tall ascenders. This goes back to metal versions
  and continues into the digital realm. Which is what Renner intended? Does the Renner
  book address this? <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s tall one <BR><A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/P_046/F_FUTU-10005000.html"

    is better &#40;I should <BR>say less bad&#41; since it&#39;s a display face anyway.

  body: ' Chris&#39; &#40;Burke&#41; book has an entire chapter dedicated to the design
    of Futura. There are original drawings as well. You might find your information
    there. <BR> <BR>Also, I enjoy the spicy remark Hrant. I agree with you, but so
    many people still use Futura for body. Wouldn&#39;t the tall ascenders assist
    the reader more than short? I mean if someone insists upon using Futura as body? '

  body: ' I guess so. But what are the chances that somebody who insists on setting
    text in Futura would go for the tall one?... On the other hand, it could conceivably
    be a good compromise solution: in a two-man team with a &#34;visual&#34; designer
    and a &#34;textual&#34; designer, Futura-tall could prevent a war. But still.

  body: ' Hah. This thread is pretty funny. It&#39;s like fighting the resurgence
    of bellbottoms for men--which are much uglier than any cut of Futura. <BR> <BR>I
    recently saw a current annual report designed by Cahan &amp; Associates that used
    Futura &#42;gasp&#42; for body copy. I was very surprised and disappointed. But
    with an objective consideration, it&#39;s actually quite well done. &#40;I am
    going to have to find out if it&#39;s the tall or short variety. Heh.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>So, by talking about it so much, are we predicting a new popularization of
    Futura? I hope not. As anyone who&#39;s ever worked with a design system based
    around Futura may agree, it&#39;s a very boring font after a considerable length
    of time. <BR> <BR>//joe '
