  body: The Shu Uemura logo is the magnificent vintage wide grotesque <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=brazilia&x=14&y=6&sample_text=shu%20uemura&sample_size=36">PL
    Brazilia Three</a>. Once you've seen it you won't want to use Helvetica Extended
    or Akzidenz-Grotek Extended ever again. ;^)
