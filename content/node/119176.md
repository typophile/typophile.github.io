    (like this one)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letter-opener-22534472120_4576.jpg]\r\nand
    then modified the shape to make the different letterforms."

  body: "Very insightful Victor. BTW your letter opener looks like the head from a
    whale :)\r\nAll I can do is also speculate. Looks like patterns for cut-out templates
    that could be used to trace letters. Seems they all started out with the same
    outline, like _I_, and portions were cut out to simulate the letters. What would
    be the difference between _A_, which is shown, and _R_? _Z_ would fall apart.
    _M_ is wider. Presumably you turn it upside down to make _W_. Actually, I have
    no idea...\r\nDon"
