  criteria:\r\n- overall letter shapes similar to FB Stainless Extended Light\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/stainless/ext-light/\r\n-
  but and this is crucial have some contrast in stroke weight (think an extended Sweet
  Gothic)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSeb"

    family. It\u2019s a high-contrast sans with some roots in early 20th century Art-Deco
    influenced gothic styles, so shares some small heritage perhaps with the Sweet
    family.\r\n\r\nDJR works a lot with Cyrus, so while Condor isn\u2019t quite as
    quirky and angular as Stainless, some general Highsmith influence has undoubtedly
    rubbed off.\r\n\r\nAnd there are both Wide and Extended widths of Condor.\r\n\r\nIs
    this along the lines you\u2019re thinking?"
