  body: 'I guess the question is: How to reconstruct the styles and sizes used from
    a page of bits? First, you can answer the question, how tall is the EM either
    by typing an H and a return and an H with 0 leading, or count pixels from baseline
    to baseline any way you can. If you are working on the Mac, (72 dpi), your pixel
    count is the same as your point size, (or close enough). If not, your formula
    is: Pixels per Em = resolution/72 X points and you can rearrange it several ways
    depending on the variable you''re seeking...but because Nearly all fonts on all
    Windows driven screens are fractional point sizes, type is only approximately
    a point size there.'

  body: "The question, and answers so far, seem to ignore the fact that web text generally
    isn't, and shouldn't be, specified in points, which are a \"real world\" physical
    measure.\r\n\r\nThe actual size of text you see is affected by your own display
    resolution (72dpi is a bit of a myth by the way) and your browser view settings.\r\n\r\nIf
    you need to specify web text size absolutely, rather than relative to the user's
    base size (em), you're better off doing it in pixels (px). "

  body: "If it is a web page, view the page as code (source).  If you are lucky and
    they have inline formatting, you might see a size but it will not relate to points
    very well.  If they use a style sheet as they should, it may not even be available
    to you.\r\nThe big wiz is that browsers, monitors, video cards,  and system configurations
    vary all over the place.  Typographic point size is meaningless on the web. The
    best you can do is count pixels and that only works for one set-up.  Set your
    monitor to a higher rez and it is out the window.  This is why controlling typography
    on web sites is such a royal pain to attempt.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: I am not sure yiou can reconstruct perfectly it without testing - but if you
    want to know the answer for sure & quickly and you have access to the site you
    can look up their CSS and see exactly what was used.

    looking at the screen capture and is certain. Whereas pixel counting is less precise/sure.\r\n\r\nOr
    you could just look at the capture & dink with your CSS until you get the same
    result."

  body: "\" (72dpi is a bit of a myth by the way)\"\r\nYes. All screen resolution,
    and point size(s) there put, is/are a bit of a myth, but there are always ways
    of turning the mythical sizes into a number of actual pixels, and, unless there
    is a .5000000 remainder no longer in evidence, actual pixels can be turned into
    mythical points, through the mythical resolution, be it Mac or WinTel.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to blow away the myths, you *just* need to measure, with a ruler, the
    actual area occupied by a screen's full capacity, then use the \"Displays\" control
    panel or its kin, to get the pixels displayed across and down, e.g. 1600 x 1024,
    dividing that into the measure you just made and you have the actual dpi. THEN,
    you need to know the dpi being used by the OS, and the number of points the OS
    thinks there is in an inch, and then you can figure out, depending on whether
    you're looking for pixels or points, what's what, including, if you can, specifying
    a fractional point size that wil get you an ACTUAL, e.g. 12 pt.\r\n\r\nThe part(s)
    that cause(s) the mythic shroud is that the OS does not know the actual size of
    the screen(s)'s writable area(s), and the device manufacturers lie about resolution.
    This issue was almost solvable at Apple until another choice was made, and MS,
    (where the myth of point size is additionally murked by a resolution guaranteed
    to leave remainders, and as unruly a herd of device makers as is possible), was
    lobbied to improve this in Longhorn coming, but they only got to 1/2 of it. \r\n\r\nThe
    results of this are a sad lack of truth to the terms \"actual size\" and \"100%\",
    not to mention, 10 point, but 'eh', you can't have it all..."

  body: "Quark is the only graphics application I know in which you can tell the app
    what your actual screen resolution is to get real 100% views (any others?). Should
    be more common - Acrobat particularly should have this. I know a few browsers,
    like Firefox, allow you to switch between the 72dpi Mac and 96dpi Windows standards.
    (I guess strictly rather than dpi the measure is pixels per nominal text inch)\r\n\r\nIt
    will be much more of an issue when display resolution increases significantly.\r\n\r\nWhen
    I said 72dpi was a myth I had in mind 2 issues:\r\n\r\n(1) it's too often used
    when it really isn't relevant, for example the old chestnut of scanning an image
    at 72dpi because it's for on screen use\r\n\r\n(2) all the displays I've used
    in the last few years have been closer to 90dpi anyway.\r\n"
