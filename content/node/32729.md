    certainly more interesting than rubbish old Myriad.

  body: Ahh, good point, Nigella. Font Bureau created a custom version of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=venus">Venus
    </a> for Macromedia called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990508164024/www.fontbureau.com/custom/">Vonnes</a>.
    That link goes to an archive.org cache. Sadly, no images remain. But the exclusivity
    contract with Macromedia was supposed to expire in 2005. Write Font Bureau and
    ask.

    I believe that wraps this one up!"
