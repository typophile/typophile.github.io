  section.\r\n\r\nI was wondering what size should be my document in illustrator when
  you design a glyph so when you take it to FontLab it is proportional to the rest
  of the glyphs that are already there (Having started from a already existing font).\r\n\r\nMy
  first research made me use the UPM and set it to 1000 and then my illustrator file
  was set in points to 1000 by 1250 pt.\r\nThen i had to see the descenders size and
  set guides in illustrator to draw my glyph there but then I stopped.\r\n\r\nI have
  no idea what size should my glyph be because even when i have the guides drawn and
  all i still have missing values.\r\nI also checked the do not scale when importing
  .eps\r\n\r\nThats about all i know till now about importing from illustrator.\r\nIf
  anyone can explain to me the logic behind the whole process and how to do it in
  the future without having to memorize without knowing the why's behind every step.\r\n\r\nThanks
  everyone.\r\nTyler."

  body: This is a big help Dan, as I've been mucking about in font design over the
    past couple days. Although I don't have access to or own Font Lab so my efforts
    are purely for self satisfaction or lack there of ;). I'm gonna go put all my
    glyphs in diff files like it seems you're supposed to.
