body: If one wants to alter and make smaller just the x-height of a typeface, (z-height
  = 446 > 407) and keep the Cap height the same, which other letters besides the numerals
  and the Capitals should stay the same?

  body: "Depends on the character set of the typeface which other characters need
    to be held the same.\r\n\r\nNote that even with lining numerals, they are not
    always the exact same size as the caps. Sometimes they are slightly smaller. Look
    at for instance Helvetica, or most any of Robert Slimbach's typefaces. (Though
    even then they are close to cap height, and need not be reduced if you're changing
    the x-height.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thank you very much Thomas.\r\nI will just reduce the x-height glyphs and
    then I will see if I have to do any readjustments to the Cap height glyphs, the
    ascenders and descenders.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n"

  i.e.  numerals and Capitals?
