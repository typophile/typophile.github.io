  styled type of fonts, with probably my all time favorite being WTF New Strike, which
  has become more main stream of late and I am now looking to find some new high end,
  high quality typefaces in this kind of style.\r\n\r\nAnything that gives a futuristic
  / technology feel.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately New Strike was created and held at http://www.twice2.ch/news2.htm\r\nbut
  they no longer promote the fonts they created.\r\n\r\nSomething similar to it is
  http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=sevil_alias_esra_li\r\n\r\nBut obviously being
  a free font it doesn't quite have the quality finish that New Strike has.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be great"

  body: This raises the question of what constitutes "futuristic" in this modern age.
    Is it still the squared-sans, variants of which have been popular since the 1960s,
    or is there an emerging trend with less connection to the past?

    seriously thought about the future and wanted to make it happen.

  body: "I think what we're discussing in this thread are techno fonts. Techno fonts
    grew up alongside high tech electronics and industrial equipment. It's a term
    that's less likely to show its age than futuristic. 10,000 years from now, the
    technological revolution will still be traced back to the late 20th century. Whereas
    the term futuristic will always be vague.\r\n\r\nFutureman: \"What do you mean
    futuristic? Like 8060's futuristic or more of a 9040's look?\"\r\n\r\nWhen I classifying
    techno I think it's important to define the distinction between industrial and
    techno. It's similar to the difference between hard rock and metal. Many consider
    the first metal  album to be Judas Priest's British Steel. Judas Priest deliberately
    shed all blues influences from rock and the metal line was drawn. <-read aloud
    in a booming voice. Techno fonts deliberately shed art deco influences. I think
    the original techno font was Microgramma. It has mechanical, industrial forms
    but deliberately kicks off all Art Deco leanings: no crossbars that pass through
    the stem, varying crossbars. From that point in time, you can trace the lines
    of indostrial and techno. The industrial line continued through the 1950 and died
    in the early 1960s. Think of the joined line automotive scripts, gas pipe square
    fonts with aligned crossbars and Huxley. By the 1960s industrial was out of fashion.
    The techno line didn't expand much until the 1970s. Between Microgramma, Stop,
    Data '70 and Handel Gothic, there wasn't much happening. When I look at an early
    1970s Photo Lettering catalog or there's not much that I'd classify as techno.
    Many of the square fonts were too cute or expressive to be techno. In the 1970s
    you had Japanese companies using techno style for logo design, particularly for
    electronics. The industrial style was old fashioned and would have looked out
    of place with high tech electronics. That's around the time of the Nasa worm logo
    (1975), Digital Sans, China etc. Around 1990s, industrial made a retro comeback
    with fonts like Industria and Bodega. At the same time the Designer Republic was
    bringing back early techno.\r\n\r\nI hate to see techno thrown into the futuristic
    basket. Let's just leave Futura, Bayer and a few others in that one.\r\n\r\n"
