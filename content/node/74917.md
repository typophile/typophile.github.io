body: "Hello! I'm doing a research and probably a project which the final \"product\"
  (only for academic purposes, I emphatize) would be a magazine in which design would
  be the main subject. I was thinking something in a similar square format as the
  new Creative Review (after the redesign).\r\n\r\nI've looked typefaces such as Apex
  New, which is one of my favourite \"squarish\" sans-serifs. Chester Jenkins did
  an awesome job on that! The typeface is beautiful and it seems to work nicely on
  body text. (Klavika is beautiful, but I want to see something a little bit different
  and yet, with some \"squarish\" proportions)\r\n\r\nThe other one that seems to
  fit is \"Leitura Sans\", by Dino dos Santos for titles and body text.\r\n\r\nI also
  thought about something that could reference something \"art-decoish\", but then
  again, Leitura Sans and Apex New have nothing \"art-decoish\" about them, right?
  (it seems that Estilo and Camera (althught Camera by Flat-It is beautiful as well,
  it lacks in variety of styles) could fill this nicely, but then, it would be moving
  away from the squarish sans-serifs).\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n1-Is Leitura a
  squarish sans-serif in the same way that Apex New is? Or is it something of a completely
  different approach?\r\n\r\n2-What typefaces mix well with Leitura?\r\n\r\n3-Is there
  a typeface that could be a \"squarish sans-serif\" and \"art-d\xE9co\" at the same
  time? Or are these completely different worlds?\r\n\r\nI'm sorry that I ask so many
  things and have so many doubts, but I'm only trying to learn more about typefaces,
  styles and magazine/editorial design. And yes, I have the wonderful book/bible by
  Robert Bringhurst! :-)\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your attention and support!\r\n\r\nAll
  the best!"

    look particularly squarish to begin with to me.\r\n\r\n2. For what purpose? Display,
    or a contrasting, text-size face?\r\n\r\n3. Art deco I don't know, but you might
    look at the two squarish sans faces mentioned in [[http://typophile.com/node/74897|this
    thread]], Allumi and Forza.\r\n\r\nZach"
