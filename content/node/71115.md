  body: "CONNER seems close to Bank Gothic, but I do not know of a unicase version,
    as this seems to be.\r\n\r\nThe blue script has three letters that needed to be
    found together: non-looping h, closed p, and this style 'r'. The font I found
    that was closest was <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/\">Ballantines
    Script</a>, but it needs connectors.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    I answered it, it shows no posts, and is still way down in the list.\r\n\r\n-
