  body: "Filip, I have the Compatil brochure, and can take photos for you.\r\nHow
    close-up? What res? The sans by itself or within the system?\r\n\r\nFor Legato,
    the best photo I've seen is here: http://typophile.com/node/29064 _\r\n(Thanks
    a bunch to Stephen for tracking that down for me.)\r\nBut I guess you'd need a
    higher-res version.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n\r\n"

    Legato, UCLA has the book, and I'd been planning another trip there... But your
    deadline might be a bit tight for me... Let me know.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
