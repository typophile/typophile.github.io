  body: ' I agree with Hrant. <BR> <BR>I wonder if you could have some ligature fun
    with the idea of &#34;fusion&#34; which means the act of fusing or melding things
    together. <BR> <BR>G Fusions sounds like a line of gangsta clothes, a la Fubu. '

  body: i think i will scrap this idea and explore the &#34;fused&#34; idea. makes
    too much sense not to. i will try not to make it look too much like the digital
    vision fusion logo which is pretty tight btw... <BR><A HREF="http://www.eyewire.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/View.woa/wa/viewProduct?product=233968"

    <BR>and check out the somewhat recently redesigned http://www.fuszion.com logo.
    these guys kick ass. <BR>i think the gfusions name was born because of domain
    availability. its a g thing.
