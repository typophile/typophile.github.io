    I would guess your nearest decent library in this subject is at <a href=\"http://creative.massey.ac.nz/massey/depart/creative-arts/design/qualifications/bachelor-of-design/visual-communication-design/visual-communication-design_home.cfm\">
    Massey</a> \u2013 unless Wanganui got its own collection of Emigre magazine back
    issues. In case you miss Stephen's generous prompt, there is also http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=101"
