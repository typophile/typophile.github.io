    --- but if you have the budget for it you could look at royalty free or rights

  body: '&#62;<i>Like the ArtRoom type of clip art...</i> <BR> <BR>Carole, I used
    to work for Image Club and EyeWire. I have several &#39;lightly-used&#39; copies
    of the ArtRoom, and other clip art CDs that I would be willing to sell out of
    my archives. Contact me directly and I&#39;ll let you know what I have available.'
