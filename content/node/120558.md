    the same weight as specimen image. _O_ is a fair match but the other letters are
    narrower. I has serifs. Inline effect is thinner.\r\nDon"

  body: "I suppose the little balls at the end of the lines are supposed to represent
    match heads.\r\nThere is a font which is a fairly close match to the specimen
    weight and letterforms, and like the specimen has slightly rounded corners. Consider
    Eveleth Clean Regular \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EvelethCleanRegAsTINDERBOX_3951.jpg]\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/eveleth/\r\nSimply
    add the inline effect and the differences from your specimen are not noticeable
    to the casual viewer.\r\nDon "
