  body: "The large type at the top (EPICERIE..) looks like \"Campanili\" shown on
    P.10 of the Solotype Catalog. I have not looked for the others, but this suggests
    typefaces from the late 1800's. I could not find a digital version of Campanili,
    although often names are changed when reviving typefaces from old designs.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Mike - Campanili is actually Campanile. There are digital versions out there
    from Aridi, on Dovers 24 Victorian Fonts CD and Dieter Steffmann offers one (the
    latter of questionable origin). A Web search will find them, Pascale.\r\n\r\nTo
    me, this appears to be hand lettered mimicking Campanile. There are even stencil
    spaces in some places.\r\n\r\nThe number 27 looks Campaniley, too."

  body: "The sign's lettering of EPICERIE is a fair rendition of Campanile, a font
    patented by William W. Jackson as D11161 on April 15, 1879 and sold by MacKellar
    Smith's Jordan, and later by other foundries, under that name.\r\nDan X. Solo
    made a digital version, 1998,  in the CD sold with the Dover book Victorian Display
    Fonts. Other independent digitizationas are by Aridi, as Aridi 70., and by Walden
    as Jugend. There is also an OPTI version which MAY be original, and a version
    by Deiter Steffmann which is most likely a rip of one of the other versions. No
    legitimate digital that I can show as a link.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
