  body: "When this was first posted I did some searches, and it seems like this lower
    case is quite different from any 'stock' Bodoni or Didot. There are VOGUE magazines
    in most developed countries, and each has a little flavor, or touch, that makes
    them a little different, but the VOGUE lettering must be a corporate custom font.
    I'm sure we've talked about Vogue before (more than once), and I seem to recall
    that 'custom'. From the 1930's to at least the 70's I think Vogue used a sans
    serif type designed for them, and I expect they have continued to want something
    that is uniquely theirs.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
