body: "Hello people,\r\n\r\nI need some crit on a logo that I am doing for a personal
  project (don't they seem like the hardest ones?), it's a website that is basically
  a web zine. The topic is vegan/vegetarian/DIY/indie subculture with accent on recipes
  and basically food and drink, but what's more important--education of people here
  (Serbia) on the topic of veganism/vegetarianism, because when you tell someone you
  don't eat meat here you look like a freak. So I want it to be very appealing visually,
  I am not looking for \"deep meaning and clever\" here, just plain sweet and mild,
  therefore the ferlauf (sorry--gradients). :)\r\n\r\nThe concept is that I took the
  word \"herbivore\" and played around with it resulting in \"herbiv.org\" for both
  the internet adress (obviously) and the mag name, it's in the pronounceation where
  you'll find the most similarity between those two. :)\r\nIt's shorter than herbivore.org
  and I think more clever and memorable, at least for me, <strong>but I'm interested
  what do you guys think?</strong>\r\n\r\nAs far as the logo itself is concerned,
  I just made the \"g\" nibble on the leaf--as the last logo says itself.\r\n\r\n(For
  claricication <a href=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y38/TheJay/herbivorg.png\">here
  are the logo versions</a> (213kB) and <a href=\"http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y38/TheJay/herbivorg_colors_and_favorite.png\">here
  is the direction I have decided to go along with the color versions</a> (518kB),
  the last bigger one is my current pick.) "

    built the url into the word as opposed to extend the word to the url.\r\n\r\nLogo:
    glad you didnt go with the 213kb versions - it was quite illegible on first impressions.
    Your current pick is the best of them so far imho.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I prefer the Clarendon version (that maybe that I'm into Clarendon at the
    moment), although it will have an advantage over the didone at small sizes. I'm
    not sure that the leaf really explains/elaborates on vegetarianism, maybe a more
    distinctive vegetable would work. Your strapline will need adjusting for size
    and seems a bit close to the main body of the logo.\r\nTim"

  body: "Thanx for the comments guys, I appreceate it very much.\r\n\r\n@ Tim:\r\nI
    was planning to ditch the \"strapline\" (I had to look this one up! :)) on everything
    but the header or something along those lines, I don't think it's that necessary
    (to be on every aplication of the logo).\r\n\r\nYou may have a point on the plain
    leaf thing, can you maybe suggest something that I can't think of or haven't taken
    in concern yet?\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n> \"I was planning to ditch the \u201Cstrapline\u201D
    (I had to look this one up! :)) on everything but the header...\"\r\nI was referring
    to the website header. :)\r\n\r\nPS\r\n\r\nThat Clarendon sure is sexy now that
    I look at it. It grew on me actually, since it is the original idea (it was in
    the first iteration of the logo).\r\n_______________________________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dnevnikeklektika.com\">Dnevnik

    kind of hoping you wouldn't ask that because nothing leapt to mind, maybe you
    could use an abstract green square/cube or a cabbage/cauliflower/lettuce or a
    mushroom.\r\nTim"
