The subject of the exhibition Material of the Future will revolve around the evolution of materials considered to be the future - from plastic (first bakelites, tomofon, the first biodegradable materials, laminates AbetPrint) towards ecology, nanotechnologies, and hybrid composites. The exhibition will present works and projects of Polish and foreign designers interested in the issue of using new materials in 3d design.

The call addresses designers specializing in design using innovative materials, as well as those who, for the purpose of the exhibition, will create experimental projects using new technologies and materials.

The exhibition will present completed 3d objects, prototypes, concept sketches, photographs, advertising materials, and educational boards. 

The exhibition will be on display in the "Solvay" Center for Contemporary Art in Cracow during 1st international festival Design Attack. CCA "Solvay" is a cultural institution whose mission is to promote contemporary art, including interdisciplinary projects  combining visual arts, music and performance. The works and their authors will be also presented in the Design Attack Festival Catalogue and on the festival website. 
 
Call for submission is open for all participants. Deadline for submissions is August 31st, 2010. Submissions can only be made online at www.designattack.pl, and send to the Organiser.
