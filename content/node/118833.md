  gauges. I remember them most fondly from a Lancia Fulvia, but Ferrari Dinos used
  gauges with the same font. It's been suggested that the numerals and text are not
  the same font, I'm not sure if that's true.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in the labels
  and numerals, not the small \"Veglia Borletti\" wordmark.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.i-firme.fr/WebRoot/ce_fr3/Shops/236444/4E30/7CDF/28D0/7901/5177/C0A8/8008/349E/jauge_essence_veglia_borletti_innocenti_mini_.JPG|Fuel

    numerals and expand the letters in some instances to match your samples) is Radiant:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/font/elsner-flake/ef-radiant/text-medium\r\n\r\n(Originally
    designed by Robert Hunter Middleton for the Ludlow Foundry in 1938.)\r\n\r\nURW
    Imperial is also similar:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/imperial/\r\n\r\nAs
