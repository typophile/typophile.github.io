  versions of historical English sans serif typefaces.\r\n\r\nAlong the lines of:
  Caslon Sans, Figgins, Johnston etc.\r\n\r\nI've been trawling the forums and it
  seems like Caslon Sans is difficult to get hold of/has a strange license (I might
  be wrong). The one I've seen which I really like is John Morgan's version.\r\n\r\nI've
  looked at Figgins, and as beautiful as it is, it is a little 'bulky', for want of
  a better word, for my use.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of type history is patchy and ill-informed
  at best so forgive my vagueness!\r\n\r\nI'm looking for something along the lines
  of a sans serif that could have been used on an English shop from an unspecified
  time 'back in the day', with a bit of quirk and character.\r\n\r\nEnglish designed
  and digitised would be ideal but willing to look at other digitised versions of
  typefaces based on grotesque's if need be, such as Klim's Founders Grotesk: https://klim.co.nz/blog/founders-grotesk-design-information/
  which is as close a one I can find. It is a lovely font!"

    with a bit of quirk and character.\r\n---end quote---\r\nIt would be very helpful
    if you could clarify what you mean by \"back in the day.\" 1850? 1900? 1930? 1970?\r\nThe
    term grotesque was first applied to an early sans serif by the English foundry
    Thorowgood in 1832. \r\nEnglish shops used hand lettered signage up until very
    recently. Some were clumsy, some were elegant.\r\nIf you are looking for grotesque
    typefaces that might have influenced sign makers you might start with  something
    like Monotype Grotesque of 1926, available as a digital font http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/monotype-grotesque/
    \ \r\nA list of headline grotesque fonts http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/angloamerican_headline_grotesque/\r\nFor
    interesting variations google \"wooden type\" \"grotesque.\"\r\nCharacteristics
    of the English grotesque, as compared to other sans may include a vertical spur
    on the G and a square M. Also check the design of a, e, g and t in fonts known
    to be grotesque.\r\nDon\r\n"
