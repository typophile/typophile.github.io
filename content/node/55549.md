    you tried using the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]]? This sample only has 4 of the 12 Key letters used by the Guide
    (a, e, y and M; others are g, E, J, K, M, R, U and W), but if you have a few others
    the Guide should help.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "The image is a bit hard to read, but here is a sample set in Cooper Light.
    The n looks like it could be a bit wider in your sample, but that could be due
    to the angle. Otherwise it appears close. \r\n\r\nSorry if I botched the attachment
    file size, I could not find where it says the dimensions your file has to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MoneyCreatesTaste_6207.gif]"
