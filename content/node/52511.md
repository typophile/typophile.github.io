    The scalable bar for the samples is nice too.

    I would be ecstatic. As it is I'm merely a very happy man. I mean, they've come
    up to speed with their technology and visitor experience, but the brand experience
    still lacks somewhat in \"want it\" vibes. Notwith-standing I'm giving the new
    site a top rating.\r\n\r\nHave you guys tried out the OT feature switching palette?
    It's facking great! You can turn on and off all three levels of ligation in my
    new <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/jabberwub/fonts/\">Jabberwub font</a>.
    Click the \"ff\" lig Advanced typography widget then try checking and unchecking
    LIGA, DLIG, CALT, SALT, HIST and FRAC. Of course this thingy works for other fonts
    with OT features ;^)\r\n\r\n<em>Not just a huge improvement over MyFonts, but

    many websites are so similar, and at a resolution of not much more than 100 dots

    about as far as you can get from surprizing and it isn't hard to understand why

    what?\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\nNo new website without it?\r\nLet's assume you mean
    only font websites. Fontshop site doesn't have OT features display, neither does
    Phil's Fonts. I'm not going to fonts.com to find out they don't have it either.
    Don't make me visit fonts.com\r\n\r\n<em>Selecting \u2019terminal forms\u2019

    you honestly expect, a fully developed web application with all the bugs knocked
    out of it ryte off the bat?\r\n\r\nI think the purpose of the type tester is to
    show font buyers what a font has under the hood. I don't think it's meant to show
    OT features working in context the way they would in a desktop application. If
    it was meant to do that Myfonts would give font buyers the ability to choose paper
    color and font ink color, surely. Yes I think so. I'm pretty shure about that.\r\n\r\nYou
    know, if you give it some thought before you start typing you can figure out the

  body: I love the new site. It really shows off the fonts. It's neat how, when you
    are scrolling through a list of search results, it automatically loads new ones
    at the bottom as you scroll up. The first version I saw (at TypeCon) didn't have
    that yet--it had a "load more results" link at the bottom instead. The new way
    is much nicer and an efficient use of bandwidth since it doesn't load more results
    than necessary.

  body: I love the new ways fonts can be viewed, but I found the scroll down auto
    loading feature problematic. If you click on one of the more common tags like
    "handwriting" the number of loads seems too much for even faster connections.
    I would scroll down near them bottom and then get stuck as it loaded another batch.
    I think a 100 or so samples per page would be more stable when you've got thousands
    of samples to load.

  body: My internet connection is fairly fast (17-20 Mbps down), so the samples "below
    the fold" are usually there by the time I scroll to see them. With a slower connection
    I guess it might not be so seamless. FWIW, I don't think it's pre-loading more
    than a screen-full at a time, so even if there are hundreds, they aren't all being
    loaded at once.
