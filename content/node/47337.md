body: "I downloaded Acrobat Reader 9.0 yesterday, to test a file for a colleague.
  I already have Acrobat professional 8.12 installed. I use InDesign CS2 and manage
  my fonts with Suitcase. \r\nSince installing Acrobat Reader 9 some fonts appear
  to be missing, even though they are active in Suitcase. I suspect a font conflict
  with a font installed by Acrobat 9. Does anyone have a list of the fonts AR9 installs?
  Or a set of uninstall instructions for AR9?\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated..."

    following Extensis Best Practices guide to the letter - all seems to be working
    fine now!
