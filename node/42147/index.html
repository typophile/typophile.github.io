<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi,
I'm designing my first web site in flash and was hoping you would all know of a good sans serif font to use for it.
The site is a portfolio and needs to be professional looking. The contents include graphic design work, artwork, resume, and contact info. The font is dark gray and active page links are orange with size ranging from headlines (30 pt?) to body text like the resume (10 or 12 pt?). The site has a faded picture of the sky as the background (which I may add animated film grain/static to later) and the site has a very light feel to it.
I'm thinking something similar to Futura, but find Futura medium doesn't look right. GeoSans Light is nice but is too light- wish they had a book or medium version. Not sure about which fonts are best for use on the web that would fit the feel of the site.
Please let me know your recommendations!
Thanks in advance!!!

<div class=commentbody>There aren't very many good typefaces built for screen, at least not for text sizes. Verdana or Arial comes to mind. The new Vista-fonts (those five starting with a c) are also especially designed for on screen reading, I think.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I just read that Avenir Next is hinted for on screen use! It is a wonderful typeface. I'm guessing there are others out there as well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You're right, the new Vista fonts are really pretty. I'm a Mac user, and I tend to disregard anything Microsoft does, because it's usually a poorly done copy of something Apple did years ago, but I have to hand it to them on their new font family.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for your responses!
I've looked into the fonts you both mentioned and like the Avenir Book or the Corbel Regular (a vista font). I don't have access to either one of them to see how they'll look on the web site I'm doing. Before purchasing, I am concerned about whether they will look right in the context of the site.
I really like Geo Sans Light for the feel of the site but also know it's too light in weight. I've pasted it below.
Do you know if there is a font that very similar to Geo Sans Light but that is a book, medium or regular weight? (Wasn't sure whether Avenir Book or Corbel Regular were similar to Geo Sans Light in this way but thought maybe there's something even more similar?)
