  children with learning disabilities, and I was wondering if any of you could direct
  me to (or has any knowledge of) studies on typography for these specific subject.
  \r\nI was thinking that the most appropriate would be the use of a clear and simple
  \"ductus\" but I've never done anything like this and all the help you could give
  me would be great! \r\nThank you so much!"

  body: "Firstly, when you talk about printed material for children you need to be
    clear about the separation of typefaces to read in, and typefaces that may be
    used as models for writing from. \r\nSecondly, there is a lot of research in this
    field. Start by looking up people like Rosemary Sassoon (has a number of books
    published, and a PhD, on related matters), Sue Walker's [[http://kidstype.org|Kidstype
    project]], the work of researchers like Myra Thiessen, Ann Bessemans, and others.
    There are also studies by designers developing specifically with writing system
    acquisition in mind (e.g. Hans Eduard Meier's Schulschrift). Florian Hardwig (with
    Rosemary's contributions) hs done interesting work on this side of things. This
    stuff is off the top of my head, there's much more around.\r\n\r\nOne more thing:
    I'd be very careful with any claims any designer makes about their typeface being
    better for readers with this need or that special condition. Typeface like Mencap,
    Teiresias, Read, Sylexiad (and others whose names escape me) make -- to different
    degrees -- all sorts of claims that they are research-based. Even if there is
    some research behind them (because some are just based on \"designer's intuition\")
    it is often pretty straightforward to see that the research is looking at the
    wrong thing, or making fundamental assumptions to facilitate the experiment which
    in reality invalidate the results. In most cases researchers investigate what
    is most accessible to measurement, rather than what is relevant. Very few at all
    look into the design of documents at the level of the spread, rather than the
    letter -- and even fewer combine research into typography and research into the
    language used.\r\n\r\nAaaanyways, opinions are like the proverbial, so what do
    I know? But do look into this seriously, there's a lot of material around. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Gerry is right, the research that designers of faces for the reading-challenged
    do is really just product development. It's useful up to a point, but AFAIK, none
    of these faces have been tested against popular and well-established faces such
    as Futura, Frutiger, Verdana, Arial, Clearface, or Comic Sans. Yes, Comic Sans;
    I doubt any serious researcher, or typographer, would consider it a prime candidate
    for a \"readability\" face, on account of its name and reputation, and yet why
    not?--theoretically it checks off a lot of boxes for a readability face. Clearview
    has been the most rigorously tested of faces (for highway signage), but do those
    results translate for small text?\r\n\r\nAt least FS Me (for Mencap) has been
    designed by an established type designer (usually these faces are amateurish clunkers),
    and it's interesting that Jason Smith has given it a contemporary look -- not
    just for purposes of branding, but to facilitate readability \"at the level of
    the spread\".\r\n\r\nMany of the typeface readability research results that are
    bandied about use the RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) method. Ask yourself
    how much relevance that has to reading a book.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Dear Gerry and Mr. Shinn, thank you for your answers. The first text I read
    was that of Kevin Larson (from Microsoft I believe), and he talks about the \"poor\"
    importance of word shape recognition in comparison with serial letter and parallel
    letter recognition theories... then I found a number of papers about the subject
    but none seemed to me to be of great seriousness, that's why your references are
    important (if you don't know where to look, the web won't tell you... ). My job
    is to find a typeface that will be used to help children learn to read with exercises/games
    (there's no long text reading involved), children with learning disabilities,
    and as far as I've searched there is no real study on this, even for dyslexia
    experts seem to differ a bit too much on their studies.  \r\nMy first thoughts
    are those of intuitiveness, but there are so many opinions about this that I can't
    find an answer... I'll \"dig\" into the names you've given me now and hope to
    see some light... \r\nThank you*"

  body: "<cite> to help children learn to read with exercises/games (there's no long
    text reading involved)</cite>\r\n\r\nI think that the design of the games and
    exercises is the most important thing, then the use of illustrations and non-representational
    elements (e.g. arrows) in combination with the layout. Typefaces are not that
    important in this context. For example, do your images show nouns, verbs, or abstracts?
    Do the children read the image before the text, and how much can they infer? And
    so on. \r\n\r\nApart from Myra's work, which is directly relevant, I am reminded
    of research done by Guille Noel in Edmonton and Parma on games to help recovering
    patients with aphasia.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Dear Mr. Gerry and Mr. Shinn, the project was finally presented and approved!
    I am very happy with it, but there is still a lot of work to do.\r\nIt consisted
    on packaging layout, mascots for each area being treated, designing the interiors
    (cards, game boards, etc.) and marketing products. Now we'll start developing
    the entire line of games.\r\nWe decided to go with Sassoon, it looks great and
    it's very versatile, and the psychologists liked it too! Thank you so much for
    your help, as soon as it is on market I'll show it here... :)\r\n\r\nBest regards*"

  body: "Dear Mr. Shinn, thank you!\r\nThere is a story behind every character, and
    when you buy it you can read about it: The red heart is called MO (from eMOtional),
    she carries all the little emotions. The blue shutter box is called GU (from lanGUage),
    he can't stop talking. The orange bunny is called MI (from autonoMI), he's the
    tallest, oldest and most helpfull.  The cloud is called CI (from soCIal), she's
    fluffy and warm and loves hugs.\r\n\r\nThere were a number of reasons for using
    Sassoon, just as an example it has the 7 (seven) with the horizontal bar in the
    middle and that's the way we write it... And those exit strokes you talked about
    are very close to the way our primary teachers write and teach to write! ohh and
    it looks great with different kerning adjustments!\r\n\r\nFor know there is no
    digital version, and it is only sold in Portugal and Spain. It would take a while
    to put it in other languages because this involves linguistics and reading/writing
    therapists... \r\nThe best seller is the Sound Safari... kids love animals...
