body: "I recently received an email from Filip inviting me to look at his intriguing
  online project.\r\n\r\nFilip says:\r\n\"I have finally created the first public
  on-line version of the [[Diacritics project]]. Its aim is to build a free on-line
  database of knowledge and experience - how to design correct diacritics (what size,
  shape and position an accent should have). Text concerning the history, use, languages,
  and also some technical information is related to each diacritical mark. The project
  is on-line at http://diacritics.typo.cz. \r\n\r\nI would be very happy if you could
  check it and if you would like to edit the text, simply Register and Login - every
  page can be edited, corrected or enhanced with pictures by anyone (Wikipedia model).\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  think Filip has done a commendable job and thought many of you would like to see
  his work.  Take a look at his site at  http://diacritics.typo.cz\r\n\r\nChris Lozos\r\n"
