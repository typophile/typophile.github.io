  body: This facility seems to be built in but not used. When making a post, now,
    the refreshed page jumps to what you've just written with the url <code>http://typophile.com/node/66589#comment-390973</code>.
    I've thought that would be handy to use more.

    number after the fact, you have to View Source. People are requesting easier,
    more direct access. '

  body: As the unique identifiers are indeed already in existence, it must surely
    be possible to provide access to it into the UI?

  body: If adding an extra element to every post (like a little permalink icon) would
    be prohibitive for some reason, one convention that we could adapt from e.g. Wordpress
    blogs would be to turn the timestamp to the left into a link to the individual
    entry.

  body: "> on this site, it doesn't really seem to be necessary\r\n\r\nBuild up, not
    down: there's a feature request -that I've made- which might justify Flash: implement
    a sophisticated font crit tool. So instead of saying \"we don't need electricity
    because everything we have is made of wood\", make stuff that leverages the electricity
    that's already flowing through the system.\r\n\r\nThe real reason that Flash bashing
    is hip now among designers is that most of them have an iOS device and anybody
    with a gadget he's emotionally attached to (which is pretty pathetic) wants it
    to do more, wants the hills flattened. But they're preaching in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nClaus,
    that feature is actually in there, but it's time-triggered.  ;-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    you need Flash to do that.* (Someone with knowledge of the Canvas element & such,
    please correct me if I'm wrong.)\r\n\r\nHTML has been growing up Hrant. The capabilities
    of HTML 5 and CSS 3 are much more of a reason to \xABbash Flash\xBB \u2013 it's
    simply not necessary any more for most of the stuff it's been used for, and HTML
    is far superior in its lean-ness and its open-ness. Remember how back in the day,
    many people thought we \xABneed\xBB Java applets? :)\r\n\r\n(* All that said:
    To me using Flash for isolated tasks where it adds functionality that you can't
    have with HTML \u2013as long as it degrades gracefully for people who can't view
    Flash\u2013 would be open for debate on a case-by-case basis. But that's really
    something else than having a site's core infrastructure and basic navigation rely
    on Flash to the extent that it does here.)"
