  Had a look at the charmap, to see how complete the typeface was, when something
  caught my eye\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wundes/sprouts/regular/charmap.html\r\n\r\nCorrect
  me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a abuse of copyright to have those digital images
  of \"The Scream\" in the font ?\r\n"

  body: I don't know if this is a international law but in Sweden the copyright lasts
    for 70 years after the creators death. Since Edvard Munch died in 1944 the copyright
    will belong to Munch until year 2014. But the picture in Sprout isn't a copy of
    "The Scream", it's just a interpretation of the painting and then I think there
    are other laws that applies?
