body: I am looking to get the Stuyvesant Volume for use on windows and am wondering
  if i should get postscript or truetype, don't think they have it in opentype. So
  I am wondering which format i should purchase? And if there are any good places
  to buy the volume (discounts, coupons, etc?) Thanks!

  body: Myfonts and Fontshop both sell the OpenType version. I don't know of any way
    to get it discounted, but at $25 it's not an expensive typeface.

  body: Fonts from the big boys are rarely discounted. As jpad says, $24.75 is at
    the low end of the price scale. Get the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=BT.122458.0.0">OT
    version</a>, cross-platform and one-file simplicity at the same cost as the legacy
    formats.

    pdf, right!"

    Why even chance it. \r\n\r\nEvery press running in north america for the last
    decades use postcript rips and postcript fonts just work right. Postcript 3 rips

    down to this:\r\n\r\n1) get truetype or opentype and some printers can handle
    it...some can't will fix it for you by using a truetype rasterizer or use their
    own postcript version. And some will send the job back or call you!\r\n\r\n2)
    Get postcript and every printer will be happy!\r\n\r\nYou choose!"
