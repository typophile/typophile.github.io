  identities of the companies behind the scandinavian design also feels scandinavian.
  \r\nWe are having a hard time finding logotypes that feels like they represent the
  products and would like to know what logotypes that you think feels scandinavian?\r\n\r\n//Petter"

  body: "Well, the Finnish design companies seem to agree on sans, Futura or Avant
    Garde especially. Marimekko with their typewriter style is an exception. The clean
    lines suit the usually simple design of their products. It is possible, though,
    that I'm so used to seeing these logos, that I can't imagine anything more decorative
    in their place.\r\n\r\nThe Fiskars logo has changed a bit over the years, but
    it's still recognisable.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.artek.fi/fi/index.html\r\nhttp://www.arabia.fi/web/Arabiawww.nsf/en/home\r\nhttp://www.hackman.fi/web/hackmanwww.nsf/fi/etusivu\r\nhttp://www.iittala.fi/web/Iittalaweb.nsf/fi/etusivu\r\nhttp://www.marimekko.fi/\r\nhttp://www3.fiskars.com/"

  body: Thank you for your examples and input. All very clean but to me they feel
    cold and I don't see scandinavian design as cold, more refined and reduced but
    with caring thought. Fiskars reflects this I think, with its slightly rounded
    style.

    hold their work for DSB (Danish Rail) to be their best and most 'Danish', especially
    because of their contemporary interpretation of the letterforms historically used
    by DSB (the open 'danish g') and the works of danish early 20th century architects,
    the so called 'humanist modernist' [[http://www.kontrapunkt.com/en/cases/dsb/]]\r\n"
