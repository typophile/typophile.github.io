body: "Hello,\r\nI have found several references here and there to a seemingly interesting
  PhD dissertation written by Anthony Cahalan (aka http://www.dr-type.com ) titled
  \"Type, trends and fashion: A Study of the Late Twentieth Century Proliferation
  of Typefaces\". It has been published in 2008 by the publisher Mark Batty (NY).
  \r\nHowever, the problem is that I couldn't find a single copy anywhere in London:
  I tried Amazon (both US and UK), other online bookstores, local booksellers, the
  catalogues of all University of London libraries, including the Department of Typography
  in Reading (UK), and even the British Library... (as for the St. Bride's Library,
  it seems it's currently closed to the public).\r\nWell, the publisher is actually
  selling the book for 65 $ + international shipping fees, however at the moment I
  don't know if I'm willing to spend so much without first being able to have a glance
  at the content.\r\nIf any of you have read Cahalan\u2019s book, would you recommend
  it?\r\nAnd does anybody here maybe have a second-hand copy of the book which would
  like to sell or exchange? \r\nOr do you know where else I can find it? \r\nThank
  you in advance,\r\nCheers!"

    Cahalan has a similarly-titled article in the 2005 issue of the journal Hyphen.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Thanks @hrant!\r\nI guess you mean this article:\r\n\r\nCahalan, A. 2005.
      \u201CFonts and fashion: Typefaces as artefacts\u201D. Hyphen: Greek Typography
      Journal 5(1): 15-20.\r\nhttp://researchoutput.csu.edu.au/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=13634&local_base=GEN01-CSU01\r\n\r\nThe
      page redirects to a broken url, under \u201COther link:\u201D, so I crawled
      the Internet Archive and found the following snapshot:\r\n\r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20090914124019/http://www.acuads.com.au/conf2004/papers/cahalan.pdf\r\n\r\nThe
      title of the paper is slightly different from the one published in the Hyphen
      journal, but I hope the content is the same.\r\n\r\nI have also contacted the
      author <acahalan@csu.edu.au> to let him know about the difficulty in finding
      his book in the UK\u2014I hope he\u2019ll reply.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n(by
      the way, I love Typophile! ;)"
