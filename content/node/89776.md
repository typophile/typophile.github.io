  While it's simple enough, I still wonder what are the other methods out there? Are
  there any? I've searched the forum and haven't found anything concrete.\r\n\r\nAnother
  question, the Briem's method is so schematic that it got me thinking that it must
  be possible to be translated into a script. Has anyone taken a shot at it? The needed
  curve compensation is in direct relation to the angle of the slant and the curve,
  maybe this could be calculated? In the next version of RMX Tools?\r\n\r\nI know,
  as always the final answer is \"trust&train your eyes\". But with the help of automation,
  getting to even the halfway of things would really speed up the process and leave
  the monotonic parts for the machines."

    a solution that is not universal would still save designers plenty of time. And
    that leaves more time for the tough glyphs like S and 3."

  body: "Before I found Briem's technique, I used a different method. I don't think
    it's as reliable, but the results weren't terrible. Also, I don't think it would
    lend itself to some sort of script. That said, here's what I did:\r\n\r\n1. Slant
    the glyphs <em>twice</em> the target angle. For example, if the italic slant is
    to be 11 degrees, slant the glyphs 22 degrees.\r\n2. Visually correct the glyphs
    until they don't look distorted. (This is the tricky part since it depends on
    your visual judgment, which may not be as good as you think it is.)\r\n3. Interpolate
    with the original upright glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that in the twice-slanted
    glyphs the distortions will be easier to see and fix, and, if your corrections
    are not perfect, the imperfections will be reduced in the interpolated glyphs.
    I prefer Briem's method mainly because it's more mechanical and less dependent
    on subjective judgments, plus I'm happier with the results."

  body: "<cite>Seriously, gentle slants are generally better anyway.</cite>\r\n\r\nI'd
    be interested in hearing a rational for that. Particularly with sans faces, I
    find that the less the angle on the oblique, the harder it is to distinguish the
    oblique from the upright; there is insufficient contrast.  Although I like setting
    text in sans serif (although I'm seldom allowed the opportunity in book design)
    I dislike the use of obliques instead of a built italic just for that reason.
    Italics are often used to provide emphasis, and I think you need to be able to
    readily distinguish the italic from the roman for that to work.\r\n"

  body: "Well, there's gentle, and then there's gentle. I agree with\r\nyour concern,
    and that's why I'm no fan of \"upright italics\".\r\nI also think you have a point
    about the sans issue, although\r\nwhen an Italic has too fewer serifs than the
    Roman that's a\r\nproblem too (in terms of \"skewing\" the voice of the Roman\r\ntoo
    much - not being a good subordinate style).\r\n\r\nThe slant certainly has to
    be sufficient. And that depends\r\non a number of factors, for example the repro
    quality, which\r\ncan be hard to predict. However one thing it also depends on\r\nis
    other attributes of the design - the Italic can deviate from\r\nthe Roman in various
    ways beside slant, such that the slant\r\ncan be in the single digits and still
    work. Look at the Italic in\r\nFF-Ernestine*; it's only ~3.6 degrees, but works
    like a charm.\r\n\r\n* http://ernestinefont.com/\r\n\r\nBut why avoid steep slants
    anyway? Readability. The patterns\r\nestablished by the more significant Roman
    (and Roman<strong>s</strong>) are\r\nincreasingly violated with increasing slant.
    This BTW is also\r\nwhy a descending \"f\" in an Italic is a bad idea.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
