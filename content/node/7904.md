body: I was wondering if anyone out there can think of an italic that has the same
  feel of Eidetic Neo. I love Eidetic, but I&#39;m not in love with the cursive lc
  &#34;s&#34;. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: Brian <BR> <BR>I would simply buy the Eidetic Modern set and use the lower
    case &#34;s&#34; from there. That one is more &#34;traditional&#34;. I bet you&#39;ll
    even get a good price from Rodrigo since you bought the Neo set and explain your
    situation. I&#39;ve done a similar twisted &#34;s&#34; myself in the &#34;Oxtail&#34;
    family, but also added a &#34;normal&#34; one, just in case some picky designer
    like you think otherwise ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>Good luck, cheers/SH
