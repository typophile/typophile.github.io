  website project as well as print. Can anyone suggest something that looks similar,
  that I could use as a webfont?\r\n\r\nThere's something about it which is in equal
  parts typewriter, console, but still looks modern and clear."

  body: Ok so on further thinking, I've realised that what I love about it is that
    it is a monospaced font (which seems very fashionable at the moment). So, what
    I'm looking for is actually something that looks like a monospaced font but actually
    isn't, because that seems very impractical and a little dated.

    of the characters still seem pretty odd.

    odd. Where are my manners?\r\n\r\nI merely thought I had been tricked into someone
    setting a monospaced font with 'Optical' spacing and putting egg on my face."
