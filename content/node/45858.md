    rearrange him: just click and drag. Cool, eh?\r\n\r\n"

  body: David Moore, a local Buffalo designer and rock star, did that [[http://www.typecon.com|guy
    with the mustache & monocle]]. There are 6 other different character lock-ups
    as well, look for for them all on other media. I don't think we have named them
    yet... how about "punkts"?

    friends that also can rock the house.\r\n\r\nA note on the conference hotel -
    it's filling faster than in any other year. We are just about out of double rooms,
    so if you want to share, you need to call the hotel directly to book and see if
    they have some left. If you plan to share, please hurry. We still have some kings
    left, and suites for you high rollers."
