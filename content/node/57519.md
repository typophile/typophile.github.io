  body: "Regarding the Open Forum poster:\r\n\r\nI don't really understand the purpose
    of the background image (except perhaps in relation to \"Saving the Earth?\").
    Would it be more appropriate to use an image that is closer to the thrust of the
    event? I think you could simply use the image on the bottom.  \r\n\r\nI don't
    know if this is a personal preference but I think the multiple alignments is jarring
    and I get stuck in the all over cluster in the middle. \r\n\r\nThe type looks
    amateurish to me (a cousin to comic sans?). \r\n\r\n\"realy\" is spelled \"really\"\r\n\r\nThe
    y of Everyone is falling into the t of Invited.\r\n\r\nAre the prospective attendants
    of this event subject to censorship? While I think forums like these are a staple
    of democracy, I think it is a mistake to invoke quasi-revolutionary rhetoric in
    a country where freedom of speech rules the day (for the most part). \r\n\r\nHope
    others will disagree with me.\r\n\r\n"
