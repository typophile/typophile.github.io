  body: 'Aha, well, as Hannes Famira is a Typedesigner and the PDF shows the embedded
    typefaces as InterPol-Book, -SemiBold, -BookSc, -Medium; InterSerif-BoldSC, -LightSC,
    -BlackItalic and -Medium I''d say this is a custom typeface, maybe the InterSerif
    BlackItalic. Unfortunately their fontsite is down for rethinking. What me puzzles
    is that I was sure I''ve seen the typeface before, but you know, can''t remember
    ... and don''t know if I am mistaken. Wait, please, until the experts show up. '
