body: "Here is a problem I keep running into. I try to move a bezier handle, either
  manually or using arrow keys, and the handle on the opposite side of the node is
  affected. Here is an example: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontlab_edit_5851.gif]\r\n\r\nOn
  the left, I have selected the bezier handle. The result is on the right. I doesn't
  matter which direction I move it, I get the same result. I would love to find out
  what I'm doing wrong. Thanks for any help you can give me."

  body: ">You may have 2 nodes in close proximity and be choosing the wrong one\r\n\r\nYou
    can detect if you have one node on top of another or almost on top by clicking,
    and then moving the node eg ten units (shift + arrow). The two will then separate,
    and you can delete one. Also look out if your node is a start point, as it can
    limit what you do. You can always change the start point (from the contextual
    menu) if you are having trouble. "
