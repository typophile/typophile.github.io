  fonts. I produced some fonts a while back that were released with some sales. I'm
  considering updating them to the opentype format, but while doing this I've realised
  that I could improve them with better outlines (redrawing some glyphs) and fuller
  character sets. \r\n\r\nBasically I think the fonts have merit but could be better
  drawen.\r\n\r\nR"

  body: "If it's to add OT features (or in general to accomodate a new technology)
    it's often a\r\ngood idea. But if not, spend your time on an update only if there's
    a strong demand\r\nfor it; otherwise just make new, better fonts.\r\n\r\nAnd don't
    follow the Mrs Eaves model: arrogantly refusing to fix an obvious\r\nand serious
    flaw (in that case horrible spacing) during an upgrade to OT.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "But updating to the opentype format with outlines that I know could improve
    with little effort seems like half doing the job. I think part of my question
    should be, If I was going to update a font should I rename it accordingly, if
    the font was \"Myfont\", should the update be Myfont 2 or Myfont new.\r\n\r\nRr"

  body: if you think the work is worth doing, do it. i don't think you need to name
    the font something different, if it's not a major overhaul. maybe send out an
    email to past licensees of the font letting them know that it's been updated and
    change the version string in the font would be sufficient, i would think.

    made substantial improvements/refinements and released the face under a different

  body: "Yes, as long as you're doing an upgrade for OT anyway, and the improvement
    for the time spent would be very high, go ahead. But do add a suffix, otherwise
    you'll just confuse people (and probably yourself too).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I agree with the above comments. If it has new features, give it a new name.
    Appending \"New\", \"Neue\", \"Next\", \"Pro\" are all good ideas. It's also useful
    from a practical standpoint to make sure the font has a unique PostScript and
    menu name. I don't use \"Helvetica\", I use \"HelveticaLT-Std\". That's a bad
    example though, because I don't actually ever use Helvetica. \r\n\r\nThis really
    is a build topic, because different fonts with the same PostScript name cause
    end-users a lot of confusion and grief. "

  body: Face it, fonts are software and software needs to be updated from time to
    time. Make sure you change the version string in the font header to reflect that
    it is a new font. I agree that you should also change the family name slightly
    to avoid confusion. We just released major upgrades to our <a href="http://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/sets/?CID=7">Giacomo</a>
    and <a href="http://www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/sets/?CID=8">Rawlinson</a> families,
    and we renamed them using a 2.0 suffix. Personally I think the suffix Pro should
    either be abandoned or made to stand for a very specific set of features. As it
    is now it is pretty useless.

  body: "I'm {slowly} updating my back catalog of PostScript Type1/TrueType fonts
    to OpenType.\r\n\r\nI've made the decision to add the suffix \"Pro\", to distinguish
    them, as I have made some changes, hopefully improvements. Tweaking a character
    here and there isn't a big deal, but messing with the metrics is definitely a
    no-no if you keep the same name, as it could cause documents to re-flow. So \"Pro\"
    goes a way to avoiding that kind of \"version conflict\" problem.\r\n\r\nAnother
    decision I've made is to not release what Adobe would term \"Standard\" Opentype
    versions, but to make my \"Pro\" fonts include OT features such as small caps
    and alternate figures. It's not possible for the Pro designation to have much
    uniform meaning from one foundry to another, as James notes, but I think it's
    OK for one foundry to use it to designate a (more or less) consistent feature
    set within its own catalog."
