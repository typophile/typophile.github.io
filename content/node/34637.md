    is way over what I'll ever be capable of. I'm not even considering it.\r\n\r\nBut
    all in all: These two fonts are VERY nice, readable, usable and have just enough
    harmony. I simply love'em. Seriously!\r\n\r\n- Robert"

  body: "Thanks Terry, although I doubt I'll be seeing it everywhere in the UK; it's
    a different market to the USA. I think script fonts sell far more in the States
    than here. They are too 'expressive' for us repressed Brits :^) although there
    is a lot of amateurish looking hand done type now.\r\n\r\nIf anybody has any photos
    of it I'd be happy to see them.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: really? i found olicana through the main type page at veer... that was last
    night... needless to say i was hooked straight away... so i convinced my boss
    to get it today... i'm an in-house designer for the salvos in melbourne, australia,
    buying fonts is not something they are used to... they usually just stick to freebies
    and system fonts... which is rather limiting after a while... but i'm worken on
    em... i can see olicana being used a lot by me... thanks again it's great! - sye
