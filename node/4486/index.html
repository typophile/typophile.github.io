		<div class="commentbody">Overall, I think an important issue is whether you want this to be a text type. If you do see how the curves and spurs and relative widths are affected by being 12 pt and below. I think if you put readability at small sizes as your goal, it will help decide what direction you want to go with it, and get one font design.  <BR> <BR>On the other hand if you go for a maybe different or related display type, you will be more free to be expressive and innovative. <BR> <BR>Generally your letters are really beautiful, but it is said that a text type is 'not a collection of beautiful letters but a beautiful collection of letters' (Walter Tracy?) So if you go in the text direction, the main issue will be making everything fit and read well. I'm sure you will keep them elegant.  <BR> <BR>On the question of the original sharp terminal on the a, you might compare Kent Lew's Whitman, at FontBureau and his own site kentlew.com. I don't like the sharp a terminal on Perpetua, but Kent Lew made it work beautifully on his Whitman. It is sheared off rather than totally pointed though and the c s and r are also sharp in different ways. <BR> <BR>Your original had this kind of race car look and excitement about it, which would be a pity to lose at least for a display type&hellip; <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

Yes with the sharp version, no with this version <BR>R: The leg may want to extend a bit farther below the baseline. Right now it's looking raised off. <BR>X: Consider moving the lower whole left leg a bit to the left. It will better balance, and optically allign them. <BR>C: A little narrow? <BR>f: Not sure about the bracketing on the bottom left of the crossbar. <BR> <BR>There are a few places where the flowing bracketing (which I like) seems dark to me:  <BR>The join in the T, <BR>The inside of the E and F (more like the B,P) <BR> <BR>Like the italic very much! Only thought there is to make sure the dots on the i and j are fare enough from the accute accent. <BR> <BR>Congratulations. This is nice! <BR> <BR>Randy</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am just now doing my first face, a text face, and you are now at a point where the mysteries - to me - of spacing, relative widths, and thick thin contract become very important. One thing I have found is that the thickness of the horizontal part of round letters is very important, and that the thins get visually get thinner faster than the fats as you print out in text size. Thus for text faces the horzontals in my opinion shouldn't be too thin.  <BR> <BR>I would try reducing the contrast, and see how it looks in text sizes.  <BR> <BR>Also, I think the spacing needs work. It looks tight to me, but this might just be some letters. Also to me 9 point and 12 point are different animals. I believe that at 8 point the Adobe opticals 'caption size' generally are wider, looser and bolder.  <BR> <BR>The subtlety of the soft curves you have drawn get lost in small sizes, but this isn't necessarily a disaster, as people will see them more clearly in titles.  <BR> <BR>Also, I would say with the problems you say you are having with the sharp version, to try also reducing the contrast. This will mean changing the look of the terminals, but you might find a good solution.  <BR> <BR>One more issue that I don't understand is whether you have to do hinting first to get a decent read on the print out at 1200 dpi on a laser printer. Are you PDF's hinted? Are PDFs in general hinted?   <BR> <BR>Oh also the italic is great.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;a bit rude  <BR> <BR>No, of course not. But the reason for not more commentary is probably that it is not very clear where you want go with this.  <BR> <BR>I went last week for the first time to a type event, the 'Making Faces' seminar in New York. The two from House Industries, Font Bureau's David Berlow, Matthew Carter, and Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones.  <BR> <BR>What I was really struck by in these folks who are producing and selling a lot of fonts is that the 'brief' for the font was critical. In the case of House Industries, it was more aesthetic: they wanted to take lettering they admired, and make functional type from it. For the others, it was producing fonts for specific purposes within a publication.  <BR> <BR>You have a lot of good ideas here and elsewhere, and a gift for elegant shapes, but I think you may be helped by a more clear brief for these fonts - either your own, or some one else's. For example, with your 'Eliza', you had a clear brief, and just produced the thing.  <BR> <BR>The scientist Michael Faraday kept a slip of paper in his top desk drawer. It said 'work, finish, publish.' I wish I always took this advice, but I think it's good. You will have chances to revisit old ideas once you do them for one purpose.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">(Caveat: there is no &quot;Proof&quot; of the following. Its only merit is making sense.) <BR> <BR>The monocular form is too modular with respect to the rest of the alphabet. It is very legible, but does not contribute much divergence to boumas. The conventional, closed binocular form is richly divergent, but it's way too complex - it violates the &quot;rules of belonging&quot; of the Latin alpahabet too strongly. Topologically only the &quot;B&quot; (which is way less frequent, and bowl-adjacent) is equal to it, and then there's the ear on top of that! Giving it an open bottom -especially with a diagonal join that swells- ties it nicely into shapes like the &quot;s&quot;, while reducing &quot;alien&quot; complexity. The best example of this form is B&amp;R#2/Oxford/Monticello; another good example is Patria. <BR> <BR>That said, there might very well be other structures that nobody's even thought of yet (or at least that haven't been promulgated adequately) that are even better than the open binocular. I just haven't been able to think of any do far. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Hrant that the binocular g is the most out-of-place character in the alphabet, but I don't buy the binocular g with open loop being necessarily better.  <BR> <BR>Among classic faces, Baskerville has it, but the loop is nearly closed. The slightly open loop - as in your face above also - I think is fine, but I find when faces try to open it more, it most often looks awkward. For example, the open binocular g I think mars Meta, which is otherwise great. I notice that in Unit, Spiekerman has the closed loop. <BR> <BR>I also do agree with Hrant that it is a letter where there is scope for new ideas. I just don't usually find the binocular loop opened a lot works well. The monocular g you have been experimenting with here is very interesting, for example, though I think it is not fully solved yet.   <BR> <BR>By the way, Kabel is one of the few that has a really different g that works well.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;sounds like a lot to start with <BR> <BR>At the 'Making Faces' seminar a few weeks ago in New York, when someone asked about the proliferation of styles and weights in type face families, David Berlow of the Font Bureau said &quot;You know, we didn't start this.&quot; In other words, the demand came from clients.  <BR> <BR>I really think that having a variety of weights and styles, as well as optical variations, as Adobe has done, gives a face an edge over others for designers, as it becomes so adaptable to different challenges. So I think the variety you talk about is a good idea. <BR> <BR>Also by all means complete and include your display version, which you have already. Having this for subtitles to titles and even 'poster' is great, and gives you an edge, particularly because the display is so good.  <BR> <BR>As to what to do first, and how to market it, I think this is something that a font publisher can tell you best, because they know the market. Maybe the best thing is to approach them with what you've got, and see what they suggest. <BR> <BR>I agree with Aaron about the top of the g being slightly too heavy, but not about the k. When I printed it out (1200 dpi laser printer), the gap actually closed in the text size, and in any case it harmonizes with your other opened letters, bpq.</div>

I have loosened the spacing overall, redesigned some of the caps: K, R revised some of the lc, especially k, x. The numerals have been redesigned, some ampersands added, and the small caps fixed. This version is for text/reading, 12pt and below. All of the weirdness that used to be in it has been saved and juiced up for the display version. I am yet to finish the display, as well as the italics and bold.

They might be those old ones you can't use anymore, or be like 1 yens which aren't really worth anything. Yeah. <BR> <BR>anywya, looking good bro.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>People can get used to anything. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t affect them. I&rsquo;m used to the traditional closed-bottom binocular &ldquo;g&rdquo; myself, and didn&rsquo;t realize there was anything wrong with it until I started seriously thinking about the Latin alphabet. But just look at it. It&rsquo;s almost an oriental logograph. Formally, I would point out that its topology is way more complex than any other lc letter; and in the entire alphanumerics only the &ldquo;B&rdquo; matches it, and at least the &ldquo;B&rdquo; has the two counters abutting - the &ldquo;g&rdquo; has a link on top of everything. Anecdotally, I would point out that this &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; complexity is what makes it so hard to draw well, with many competent designers failing when they come to it (eg Matrix). It&rsquo;s especially hard to get a double-&ldquo;g&rdquo; not to form too strong a pattern that ruins the texture (affecting immersive reading). So it&rsquo;s not a legibility issue (almost anything is legible) it&rsquo;s an issue of standing out too much, and by itself. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think complexity is da bomb - but it has to be balanced - and I feel that the open-bottom binocular form is the ideal (general) balance.</p>
