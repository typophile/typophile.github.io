    Let's hope you get lucky and somebody recognises it straight away.

  body: "Your best bet would have been if this was one of the 300 Handwritten Fonts
    that came from the orignal ClickArt CD (and are now part of a Broderbund ClickArt
    fonts collection). Bad news -- I looked through them all, and though some are
    close (especially Wolf), I didn't find a match. \r\n\r\nAs Yves said, there are
    'a gazillion' of these things. You can see about 500+ of them in <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html\"
    target=\"new\">Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide</a>. Your best  option if you
    don't see it, is to find the closest and go with that. This is one of those times
    when it's really not worth an extended search. These fonts can be made by <em>anyone</em>
    for almost no money.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
