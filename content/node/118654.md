body: "What is the thinking behind the name \"counter\" in type anatomy?\r\n\r\nI'm
  recently pondering over the translation of some typography glossary. We all use
  \"counter\" to describe the space enclosed or half enclosed in a letter, but how
  did this name come into being? \r\n\r\nSimply, which meaning of the word \"counter\"
  did they employ to refer to that part of the letter? Some people just relate the
  image of a cashier counter to this meaning but I don't think it fits...\r\n\r\n(Sorry
  if this is a stupid question, I'm not a native speaker of English language. If someone
  can even provide some historical reference it would be much appreciated.)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "You may know, in the days of hand-crafting metal types, that an engraver
    would carve a positive letter shape onto a metal rod called a punch and then strike
    that into softer metal to make the mold (\"matrix\") used to cast type. An engraver
    could relatively easily carve the outside shapes of that letter on the end of
    the punch, but it isn't easy to get into the interior spaces with the carving
    tool. So the punchcutter would make an additional punch of the negative shape,
    and strike that, head to head, into the punch first, then carve the rest. That
    additional punch for the negative space was called a counter punch (since the
    direction it was struck was counter to the way the punch proper was used). So
    interior spaces on the punch were achieved with the counterpunch tool, and the
    spaces in the resulting types were consequently called counters.\r\nIf you're
    interested in this nitty gritty, Fred Smeijers' /Counterpunch/ is a fantastic
    read."

    body: "That helps a lot! And such a good reference for further digging, a thousand
      thanks to you, eliason!\r\n\r\nMany translation versions are wrongly related
      to the noun form of \"counter\" instead of indicating the type cutting origin.
      So it really helps to clarify the myth."

    body: But what did people call it before type cutting came into being? Does "counter"
      comes before or after "counterpunch"? Can it be that people also called it counter
      in the past, because it is a negative space in a letter?

    or \u2018opposite\u2019. Which should explain the meaning of counterpunch\u2026\r\n\r\nIt
    stands to reason that before type was made in a semi-industrial process with a
    punch, the term \u2018counter\u2019 was not used; the counter being the <em>result</em>
    of the use of a counterpunch."
