  body: indesign open wordfiles easily. Nothing special to do, only to import the
    file, and it will come nice. <BR>And in other cases, you need word to open a word
    file, and in the same way the mac version of the soft who produced the file you
    have. Simple.

    files or as Word97 files instead.
