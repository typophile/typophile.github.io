  for hours to no avail so this is kinda my last resort...\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I'm trying
  to identify the font that was used in Nike's \"Challenge Court\" line of clothing
  logo back in the 90's (it was Andre Agassi's stuff).\r\n\r\nHere's a reference picture
  from one of my tees:\r\n\r\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/4688/challengecourtfont.png\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ChallengeCourtfont_5536.PNG]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  font is approximately from 1991~1992 and looks an awful lot like the \"Silhouette
  LP\" one, however the \"R\" and \"N\" don't quite match seeing as the former's gotten
  a sort of upper-left serif and the latter is completely different."
