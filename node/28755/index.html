  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Its for a company called Mixed Economy Group (MEG) who helps universities get funding from the government to support colleges with both FE (further ed) and HE (higher education). So they are the core of it all if you know what i mean. these colleges would not get funded and would not run without them.
I want to give it a sense of belonging. I tried representing different coloured circles to represent different colleges but evolving round MEG because MEG is the foundation of it all. They are the core for those colleges/universities. how can i make it better? what typeface would be better suited for this. any ideas well come! thanks.
PS This is only the beginning of my logo. i am still in the process of making it work.i will keep updating it every now and then.<img src="/images/old-images/logo1_6588.png" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">what if i had one colour but different opacity for each ring then it can work in black and white but then it wont represent the colleges on their own as an individual institution but i can turn the meaning around and say they are all under MEG and they on in thier catogory because there is another company like them (who are thier competitors) who only focus on HE and another company who focuses on only FE so i can say we are all of the same company by using opacity of same colour. what do you think? good or bad? thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I kind of liked the concentrated arrangement of rings that you originally had. All I meant was that I&rsquo;d like to see them go in front of and behind each other, linked together instead of being simply stacked. I think that interconnected rings would convey the overall shape better instead of existing as individual rings.</p>
<p>I would have tried to simulate it with your logo, but the large version of the logo seems to be missing. So I&rsquo;ll try to illustrate what I mean in a poorly-rendered two second photoshop sketch:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/rings_6593.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The left represents what you had, and the right represents what I meant&hellip;kind of. But now, seeing your logo at small sizes, I don&rsquo;t know if that will really make a difference. So take it or leave it.</p>
<p>I like what you&rsquo;ve been doing with the type, and prefer it within the rings instead of without. The all blue solutions do give you a better sense of the overall shape, and would definitely help with the black and white issue.</p>
<p>Hope this helps,
David</p>

<p>Yes, in school I was taught the same thing. If the logo/mark doesn&rsquo;t work in black and white only it can&rsquo;t be a very good logo. But, when you have the budget to control something, as the Olympics does, they never have to worry about there logo being in black and white. (ehe. Maybe they regret that sometimes.) The fact that you are going to great lengths to make sure your mark works in different ways is good. I think the single line weight as opposed to several is probably a safer bet. You might consider the line weight at different sizes. Are there fewer lines when it gets smaller?</p>

Especially in this instance, as I think the logotype greatly detracts from the mark&rsquo;, did you mean that the &lsquo;meg&rsquo; in the logo is different to the type on the side (the other variations i have done on the right hand side). is that what you meant? do you think taht because its wrong and shouldn&rsquo;t be there. tehre should just be 1 thing saying Meg not twice. is taht wrong or no0t good? i&rsquo;d like your thought on that please. do you think that the circles with the &lsquo;meg&rsquo; in is itself a logo and does not need the type Mixed Economy Group. is that what you meant? thanks</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer this in a single colour with tints, the solid colour rings cancel each other out rather and give almost a spirograph impression, wheras the lighter colours in the other version are obscured and also draw comparisons with the Olympics as has been noted. I would, for most uses, include the full name, however that needs to work with the text in the circles, by which I mean that it should align to some aspect of the type. The bottom two on the left of your latest post especially would benefit from this, it will also make the circles more dynamic by emphasising the eccentric position of meg. You could also try ranged right text under the circles ranging on the right of meg.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>hi giggles, 
I liked the colored circle ones, but i think you should explore little more. To me the combiation of these three letters(MEG/meg) seems very interesting&hellip;have two, three or four cup of coffee and do some doodeling in the notebook, ..am sure u&rsquo;ll come up with some interesting ideas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll show you the doodles of meg I did while reading your post. Can&rsquo;t scan them right now as I&rsquo;ve my jury tomorrow :(</p>
<p>All the best

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This was the first idea came in my mind while seeing your solutions. I&rsquo;ll say explore a bit more, there are lots of possibilities in your identity. And yeah&hellip;must keep your concept in mind while playing (for whatever purpose you&rsquo;re making your logo..coz i didn&rsquo;t as i dunno much..what its all about)..</p>
<p>Right now in both of my attempts, there lots of problems, like the second logotype will reads a &lsquo;mpg&rsquo; and not meg&hellip;but these are challeges which makes things more interesting.</p>
<p>G&rsquo;Luck</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I liked your this idea a lot&hellip;you can work on this further. because according to me its going with your concept and the company for you&rsquo;re making this logo. But these rings wouldn&rsquo;t look good in B/W or grayscale.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The comment about multiple line weights &ndash; When I first viewed the last logos you posted, Giggles, it looked as if some of the lines were different weights. I see now that it was simply the colors tricking the eye.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the acronym <strong>meg</strong> should be touching the circles. I also question the use of lowercase and wonder if this wouldn&rsquo;t be a good time to use a unicase of some sort. Maybe?</p>
