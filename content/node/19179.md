  bought a used Apple Powerbook G4 with 1000 fonts <cite>already</cite> installed.
  Who owns the font licence now? Is it the previous owner\u2019s or my friend\u2019s
  responsibility to delete the fonts from the hard drive? \r\n\r\nHow do you <cite>usually</cite>
  transfer a licence? Is there a common ground here?\r\n\r\nI had a quick look through
  some of the EULAs on disk and I admit I was perplexed by the legal-lingo and general
  lack of standardisation regarding licence transfer.\r\n"

    the permission to use</strong> the fonts, but doesn't actually <em>own</em> them.
    Common logic tells us you can't transfer what you don't own. If another end user
    wants to use those same fonts, he needs to purchase his own license.\r\n\r\nIt
    was the previous owner's responsiblity to delete the copies of the fonts from
    his hard drive before selling the computer to your friend. But it's your friend's
    responsibility <em>not</em> to use said copies of fonts -- if he does, he is liable
    for prosecution.\r\n\r\nAnyone, correct me if I'm wrong."

    however some of the EULAs had transfer clauses such as the example below.\r\n\r\nExample;
    <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/Legal/MI-EULA.htm\">Monotype</a> \r\n\"You may
    transfer all your rights to use the Font Software to another person or legal entity
    provided that (i) the transferee accepts and agrees to be bound by all the terms
    and conditions of the Agreement, and (ii) you destroy all copies of the Font Software,
    including all copies stored in the memory of a hardware device.\"\r\n\r\nI'm no
    lawyer, I could be misinterpreting all this. :^)\r\n"

    do a fresh install of OS X  thus losing all previous font data but it did raise
    the question on how licence transfers occur."

    The seller was the real licensee of the fonts on his computer before he sold the
    machine.\r\n2. The seller deletes all other copies of the fonts he has, including

    Other foundries and other fonts might have differnt EULA restrictions regarding
    license transfers. You friend must check up after all 1000 of the fonts."

    them as we are not absolutely sure if the seller had really licenced them, for
    all we could know he/she could've downloaded them illegally online. This was basically
    the reason why I told my friend he should just reformat.\r\n\r\nThanks for the

    on ebay, clean it. Forget it. If you bought the computer from a colleague or close
    friend, just ask if the font licenses were included in the selling price.\r\n\r\n(Of
    course, it isn't simple at all in the buyer's sense\u2026 if the fonts are legit,
    he still has to look at the EULAs for each foundry to see whether or not he can
    even have possibly purchased the license from the orginal owner or not.)"
