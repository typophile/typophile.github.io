body: "I like to lurk around on these boards a lot, but this is my first actual post.
  \ Don't cringe, but I am actually a real estate agent who is infatuated with fonts
  & design.  I always laugh when I read a post about a design one of you has made
  for a real estate agent and the comments that follow, such as this from cuttlefish:\r\n\r\n\"Lots
  of real estate brokers want their portraits all over everything too. Majorly cringeworthy!
  The only people who should have headshots on their business cards are performers
  and prostitutes, IMHO.\"\r\n\r\nI can't agree more!  What's with that???  At any
  rate, I am working on designing a logo & would love to hear feedback.  This company
  is located in a very small town in the midwest.  If you want a feel for the audience,
  I think an email I once receieved says it best: \"you know you're from Wisconsin
  when...you think Madison is exotic.\"  We're talking pretty conservative, very \"inside
  the box\" kind of thinking here.\r\n\r\nI hope the final design will portray not
  only experience (by using a commonly known, not-new phrase for the name) but also
  that the company is tech-savvy & modern.  I hope it will feel fun without losing
  any professionalism.  The logo will be used for cards, letterhead, etc as well as
  for yard signs.  My original design was the blue/yellow, but I would love to incorporate
  one, maybe two, other colors just so we have some choices when it comes to web design
  and things like that.  I used Myraid Pro because it always feels neat/clean/simple/uncluttered
  to me, but I am open for suggestions on any and/or all of it!\r\n\r\nI hope it isn't
  taboo for me to post here since I am not a designer...maybe in my next life I'll
  be lucky enough to join your ranks!"

    in black and white and get the form the way you want it and then worry about the
    colors?\r\n\r\nI think you will find that degree is going to suffer when this
    logo is shrunken down (think business card size).\r\n\r\nYou're off to a good
    start.\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: "You're off to a good start, but cut back to black-and-white for now. Also,
    be careful how you use the two circles; when they abut it can create some nasty
    visual problems. For example, in the second example the alignment of the little
    circle makes the area around it vibrate as it seems to warp the edges of the inner
    and outer circle. In the third example, because the circles are different colors,
    distracting little points are created where the circles abut. \r\n\r\nLast, don't
    use red and green together. They're complementary colors and buzz against each
    other, which tends to irritate people."

    getting a lot of flack on the circle under the \"th\"...what do you think?"

- body: "The little circle is redundant and visually distracting. \r\n\r\nIt's a symbol
    we read -- unlike a comma, we actually say \"degree\" when a circle follows a
    number.  Therefore, your company name reads \"nth degree degree\".   \r\nI say
    it needs to go. \r\n\r\nThe rest is getting better.  I'm bothered by the shift
    in weights between the \"n\" and \"th\"  --  the font sizes are too close for
    these two elements to have different stem weights, it looks odd.   Try scaling
    down the \"th\" or scaling up the \"n\".  Perhaps the \"n\" can drift out of the
    box like the circle does?\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts.  Overall, a great start for
    a non-designer design! Well done."

    process.\r\n\r\nTry it small, on a business card, and large, on a lawn sign, and
    see how it looks in the hand, or driving by.\r\n\r\nThat way you will be able
    to tell whether your combination of colors and type weights are working, and whether
    the design elements will scale nicely."

  body: When I look at your second version, I read "N-O-T-H" rather than Nth Degree...That's
    just the order in which my eyes naturally read it, so I percieved the degree symbol
    as an O

  body: First, I think you have overall good and effective  design going and shouldn't
    stray if you like it, but I have to agree w/ the above. Take it back to mono/black
    & white. That way you can see the "design" element a little better. The large
    circle is nice, but the smaller degree symbol is distracting and is a bit confusing
    at first glance. I think the larger circle stands alone as representing the"degree"
    and I think is the strongest part of the design... Etc and so on , just keep tweeking
    the Nth part and maybe rethink the color scheme and you have a winner. Good luck.

  body: "I can't say thanks enough for the feedback.  \r\n\r\nI see what you mean
    about the stem weights of the \"n\" and the \"th\" and I also experimented with
    the \"nth\" being out of the box like the degree symbol...is this what you meant?\r\n\r\nSabre...any
    suggestions on a color scheme?  My counterpart would have it  primary red/blue/yellow
    if she had it her way - bleh.  This was a bit of a compromise, as she is worried
    no one will see it driving down the street.  I argue that people take a second
    look at something because they find it visually pleasing, and not because it might
    look bright.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the image you see here is the yard sign, 24x36.\r\n\r\nhttp://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m132/slvonb/?action=view&current=takethreesigncopy.jpg\r\n\r\ngrayscale:\r\nhttp://s103.photobucket.com/albums/m132/slvonb/?action=view&current=grayscale.jpg"

  body: "In the large version, I only see 'nth real estate', no degree (the circle
    becomes too big to be identifiable).\r\n\r\nAlso, a black and white version should
    be just that, black and white (nothing in between).  It needs to be able to work
    at that low a level (think fax machine).\r\n\r\nwhat if it was simple: nth\xBA
    real estate \r\n\r\nOne problem you are running into is that 'th' should be superscript,
    but that conflicts with the \xBA sign.  What about enth\xBA?"

- body: Why not try using another font that balances the superscript better? Also,
    I'm attaching 2 versions in B&W using Univers condensed - notice how the fonts
    appear "fatter" in white on black background?  It's exactly the same size font.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/taketwo_4595.jpg]This
    is just one of the reasons I always work in B&W first; all logos end up black
    and white eventually - faxes, photocopies, newspapers - and I need to know if
    my logo will survive the plethora of office machines.  Nobody wants to look fat,
    even a logo :)
