body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Foundries]] : Scangraphic</strong>\r\n\r\nFounded in
  1980. Mannesmann AG, one of the largest organizations in Germany, acquired Scangraphic
  in 1989 from the Dr. B\xF6ger Group, which was owned primarily by Knut Smeidel and
  Bernd Holthusen. [[elsnerflake|Elsner and Flake]] acquired the Scangraphic font
  collection in 2004 and relaunched the fonts in digital formats, with newly designed
  Euro and @ symbols.\r\n\r\n<strong>SB vs. SH</strong>\r\nScangraphic offers fonts
  in two formats called \u201CBodytext\u201D and \u201CHeadline\u201D.\r\n\r\n<em>Scangraphic
  Bodytext (\u201CSB\u201D)</em> faces are ideal for text in small point sizes. The
  hairlines and serifs of the Bodytext faces are thicker than normal hairlines and
  serifs to make them more legible in fine print. In addition to this, they have a
  special ink-traps incorporated in the font design to prevent blurring and loss of
  print quality.\r\n\r\n<em>Scangraphic Headline (\u201CSH\u201D)</em> faces are made
  for text in large point sizes. Scangraphic optimized the Headline fonts specifically
  for this purpose, for example, by narrowing the spacing of the fonts and re-designing
  the umlauts in order to make them work better aesthetically with the overall design.\r\n\r\nScangraphic
  recommends 4.5 mm capital height (18 pt) as the largest size at which Bodytypes
  should be used, this should also be the smallest size for Supertype.\r\n\r\n<strong>Links</strong>\r\n<a
