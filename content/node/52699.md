    Swarte did a nice expos\xE9 about it, circa 1978. Only in Ducth, and extremely
    rare now.\r\n\r\nThree main techniques:\r\n1. Using preprinted transparent screens
    that are applied (pasted on) to overlays (C, M and Y) on top of lineart print
    (=K). Takes great craftmanship.\r\n2. Using chemically prepared illustrationboard
    on which line art is bluelined and a limited range of screenvalues can be highlighted
    with specific fluid(s), as well as full value with india ink. Limited usabilitu,
    used for cheap comics.\r\n3. Using fixed screens to superimpose on repro film,
    using rubilith masks. Very elaborate, used for high-value stuff.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert

    with crayons or oil pastel of some kind, possibly augmented with some watercolor
    tinting.\r\n\r\nCoquille board is a kind of <cite>drawing board that comes in
    a variety of roughened surfaces that break up crayon or brush strokes into texture
