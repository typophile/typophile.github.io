  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm designing labels for a line of soaps.  One woman makes the soap, uses a lot of organic and natural ingredients.  She was using clip art before this.  I'm doing this freelance and I've really only had a couple design jobs before, so feel free to tear it apart.  Just looking for a general critique. Thanks:

		<div class="commentbody">I like the layout of the small text and the images of the herbs and flowers. That part looks simple and clear, but I don't think the gothic-revival "herbal soaps" and the sort-of Art Nouveau frame work with it. The "flavours" (if that is the right term) are too small, and in a fairly illegible face. If you want to keep that frame you're not really using the space in it properly. For example, the third one down. It's orange & what?

Below is an example of taking away everything that I think gives it too much of a homemade, slighty botched-together look. Find something equally clean and clear to say "Rosemary". Perhaps put "Rosemary (etc.) Soap" so you don't need to have the "herbal soaps" line.

		<div class="commentbody">The vignette/frame really doesn't work and the text describing the scents is completely illegible. I agree with the previous poster that the "herbal soaps" line doesn't work, it's one ornate font too many, plus it's slightly superfluous information, as the previous line already says "herbal" I'd go for a single descriptive text for each scent saying "Mint and Comfrey Soap" or "Mint and Comfrey Herbal Soap" in one clear and easy to read font, maybe a different colour for each scent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are many issues with the labels but here is a simple way to improve your labels

Purchase some handmade looking soaps that have relatively the same bar size as your clients soap. Choose examples with labels that look professionally designed. Purchase some regular soaps as well...now, measure the size of the type for the brand, fragrance, weight, description, ingredients, make a comparative list side by side to see what size your type should be for each application. 

You should also be looking at soap in stores and recording what you like about the various labels and choose ways in which your soap will stand out from the rest in a positive way.

Make sure that your label is readable from a shop-able distance from the shelf.
