  font for a site. i figured you might be able to help me.\r\n\r\nWhat i want is a
  font that is creative and interesting abut still has a serious-profesionall look
  about it. something that says, we are creative but we're also very serious in what
  we do.  and i hope it's free :)\r\n\r\nIf anyone can think of anything,thank you
  very much. i'll be around here regularly.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your ideas,rayne."

    even some larger corporations. At least, that\u2019s the case up here, but this
    is sort of \u2018ground zero\u2019, so it might well be different in Romania."

  body: "Kontrapunkt is used a lot (I use it on occasion) but I'm not sure I'd call
    it OVER used. It's a face with some style but not over-the-top, either.\r\n\r\nRayne...the
    catch is your throwing out some rather vague adjectives. The main contradiction
    is 'professional typeface' and 'free'. Combining those two together severely limits
    your options list.\r\n\r\nThat said, Jos has gifted some wonderful free typefaces
    to the world that I think would match your criteria:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/\r\n"
