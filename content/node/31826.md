  advice on how i would go about selling it on the web for people to use.\r\n\r\nis
  there an established service i can use that would make the font available for download
  and take care of the payments? do linotype [or similar site] take fonts submitted
  by any old person?\r\n\r\nalso, what about protecting intellectual property [???]
  and preventing people from copying the design of the font?\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\n\r\ndave."

  body: "Others who have actually done this are much more capable of discussing this
    with you, but it seems to me that you can ask most large foundries to distribute
    your fonts. MyFonts <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/info/prospectus/>here</a> lays
    out the terms pretty clearly. It seems like they do take fonts from \"any old
    person\" as long as that pe rson has the rights to them. MyFonts is probably the
    most popular foundry for small type designers to sell with, maybe because the
    creator receives 65% of all sales. Other possibilites I found are <a href=http://www.linotype.com/2064/submitfonts.html>Linotype</a>
    and <a href=http://fontbureau.com/submissions/>The Font Bureau</a>. However, they
    frankly seem much more discerning about which fonts they will add to their libraries,
    which means they'll probably take longer to vet your typeface for sale and might
    want changes made.\r\n\r\nAs to protecting your rights to your typeface, that's
    what the [[EULA]] (End-User License Agreement) is for. But I don't know if there's
    any way to make sure that no one rips you off illegally by just opening it in
    FontLab or Illustrator. But a thorough EULA should make sure that this is kept
    to a minimum and that you're as protected as possible."

  body: Kris asks the all-important question. The style of typeface might work in
    some libraries and not in others. There's a nice thread here about distribution
    options but I don't have the time at the moment to find it.

    still needs a bit of work and some extra characters. i'll look into myfonts and
    linotype and see what criteria i will have to meet.\r\n\r\ndon't have it on this
    computer but i should be able to post a sample tomorrow, so you'll just have to
    watch this space...\r\n\r\ndave."

  body: "OK-\r\n\r\nhere are two samples of the font. the first is the font typed
    which i just knocked up, the second [scaled down from A1 size] in a similar way
    for which it was designed- for a birthday card, hence the name Happy 1st Birthday.
    perhaps the next version would be Happy 2nd Birthday!\r\n\r\nits my first font
    so its pretty cruddy & clunky. the monospaced and blockiness are inherent to the
    design of the birthday card, the sole purpose and conception of the typeface and
    its form. it only exists in capitals although i've done the numbers and some punctuation.
    i doubt i'll do a lowercase version.\r\n\r\nthere are a few improvements to be
    made, for example i need to set a height value [i'm not sure which] so that when
    the leading is set 'solid' the top of the letterform butts up against the bottom
    of the letterform in the line above- that is how it was originally designed to
    be. i might also change the 'I' so it has a serif and fills the space better.
    it was designed to be big [and have only ever used it for titles] but i'm surprised
    at how legible it is at 10pt despite the letterforms often melting into one-  think
    thats less to do with my design and more the nature of the roman alphabet!\r\n\r\nanyway,
    i really enjoyed making it, its nice to have a second outcome evolve from a first,
    especially one you can keep re-using. all constructive feedback welcome, nothing
    too harsh though please! maybe i'll even try and sell it...\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\ndave.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/happy1stbirthdaysample01_6309.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/happy1stbirthdaysample02_3627.jpg]"

  body: "i'm not too precious about it. its very ugly, i'm sure its not everyones
    cup of tea and it certainly isn't at the finer end of typography! however it served
    its purpose well [my mate loved the card] and the underlying basis of the design
    is sound and interesting enough to stimulate a few ideas.\r\n\r\ncheers stephen,
    posting it on the critique forum would be good [although i never started this
    post with the idea of having it critiqued!!!] so maybe i'll post it up there when
    its ready-er.\r\n\r\ndavid hamuel, what are the \"usual suspects\"?\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\ndave."
