    Book and Ultra Black)? I\u2019d be curious about that."

  body: "I didn't think it was necessary to have so many. \r\nThin is still Thin,
    and the same weight as before. Ultra Black is now renamed as Black. I renamed
    it as I didn't think the original Ultra Black warranted that title. Besides, Precious
    Sans Two is a complete rework of the original Precious Sans and a vast improvement,
    so I wanted to differentiate the two."
