  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all!</p>
<p>You created your Chrysanthi Unicode Monospace font by Font Creator, but when you try to test it in Scribus, you get excessive spacing.</p>
<p>Unicode range coverage:
Basic Latin (complete in both fonts)
Latin-1 Supplement (complete in both fonts)
Latin Extended-A (complete in both fonts)
Latin Extended-B (incomplete in proportional, complete in monospace for 5.0) i
(proportional font only) These characters are not part of the Unicode Standard, and have been mapped to private use sectors 0234 – 0237. These characters are used in the Tsœxisca language. I have also mapped a capital and lower-case ezh to 0220 and 0221, respectively.</p>
