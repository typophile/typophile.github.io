    but this has been hand lettered, surely??\r\n\r\nEDIT: Of course, had I read your

  body: Hardly nonsense, Adrian - as the lettering is clearly hand drawn, given the

  body: I wouldn't say it was "based on Windsor". It's rather the other way around.
    Windsor was based on lettering like this.
