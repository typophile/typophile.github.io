body: I'm searching for a font with similar characteristics to RNS Camelia (Open Type),
  but with a full family. I am really liking the look of it, but it isn't really functional
  for the project I'm putting together without any other weights. Any suggestions?

    serifs: Lubalin Graph.'

    continues.

  body: "Good luck. \"Nice\" is not a good description of the quality you're looking
    for. Whatever you're doing, keep in mind that Camelia is not really a text font.
    The playfully small serifs ask for larger point sizes.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

    here?
