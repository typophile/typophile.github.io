  body: "I just loved it! If itunes had something like that on its visualizations
    it would allways turned on. Yes it needs a little bit fine tuning... but you're
    on a good way!\r\nIt would also be nice other experiments... perhaps some way
    to communicate sound trough words in different typefaces and weights."

  body: "\"some way to communicate sound trough words in different typefaces and weights\"\r\n\r\nthis
    is a quite interesting idea. While I was doing this I found out that if I increase
    proportionally the size of each part I would have had in most cases a seamless
    bolder weight. I'm going to publish this variant as well asap!\r\n"
