		<div class="commentbody">The problem with the question as posed by the NY  <BR>Times caption, and with the subsequent perseverating  <BR>over the two logos, is that Carter wasn&#39;t hired to  <BR>redraw the MoMA &#42;logotype&#42; -- he was hired to create  <BR>a revised cut of Franklin Gothic &#40;two of them, in fact,  <BR>text and display&#41;. <BR> <BR>Any comparison of four letters -- well three, actually --  <BR>especially these particular few, will inevitably show  <BR>little perceptible difference. The real differences, I  <BR>suspect &#40;and justification for the project&#41; will only be  <BR>seen when the fonts are used in mass. Then the  <BR>cumulative effect of refined letterforms and spacing may  <BR>show up in a difference in overall fit and color --  <BR>moderate passages of text in a catalog or brochure,  <BR>large display signage, etc. <BR> <BR>A logo alone is bound to be an inadequate demonstration,  <BR>IMHO. <BR> <BR>-- K.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant. In an attempt to answer your second question -- And I&#39;ll probably sound as if I&#39;m waffling -- I think that perhaps they chose Franklin Gothic as an understated &#40;yet bold&#41; way of representing a museum which has some of the boldest and most colorful art in New York. Or maybe just plain old -- it holds color. Why dress up the museum too much? This said, I also like what The Walker in Minn. did with Matthew&#39;s type. So that is where I&#39;m waffling. But, MoMA need not be that way. Why compare them to anyone?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I thought it strange that the writer didn&#39;t note that a <i>very</i> slightly modified Franklin Gothic No. 2 shows up all over the Times, in major section heads, captions, etc. Does anyone know how the Times arrived at their version of No. 2? It&#39;s very slightly condensed, and the dots of the i and j are a little taller, closing up the space between themselves and the lower parts of their letters, and the top of the lower-case t extends nearly to the cap height. Other than that it looks identical. <BR> <BR>So: is the Times&#39; No. 2 the same thing they&#39;re calling &#34;soulless&#34; in the old MoMA usage? If so, I suggested in a letter to the Times that they should ask Matthew Carter for a copy of the new and improved No. 2. <BR> <BR>&#40;I wonder: will Carter call the revised face Franklin Gothic No. 2.1, or does it merit a whole-number upgrade?&#41; <BR> <BR>Tim: I thought the same thing about the o kerning, but, of course, the typeface isn&#39;t finished yet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would not infer anything about the kerning or spacing  <BR>of Carter&#39;s MoMA Gothic from the overlay. I suspect that  <BR>this illustration was built on the old logo.
