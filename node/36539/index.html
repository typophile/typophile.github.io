<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Is it just me, or is the place a little quieter around here without Hrant making all sorts of noise? I know some people have, lets just say, "different" opinions him, but he does have a knack for stirring up conversation.
Maybe we should post our favorite Hrant moment in reflection?

<div class=commentbody>From [[http://www.typophile.com/node/20337|one of the greatest free-form discussions]] I've ever participated in:
“THE LITTLE PEOPLE always think what they’ve seen in their own lifetimes is what counts.” —Hrant
I’m very short, and I was offended! Hrant is elfophobic! And we should do something about it! —ER
________________________________________
One thing I'd say about hrant is I never got the feeling he was beating around the bush. I appreciate that.
He also never misinterpreted/misrepresented/blew out of proportion anything I said.
I miss him.
"BTW, my best line, when seeing them use three patrol cars and a helicopter to book a poor drunk sap: “Do you **** think you have enough people here?” Result: they followed me and gave me a ticket for a defective brake light (serves me right for exercising my free speech, gol’dangit*), but it was so worth it: you can’t BUY that kind of story." —hrant

This is a moment to reflect upon, good-naturedly, Typophile sans-Hrant. That's all.
Not every thread has to be spent upon declaring the wonders of the perfect notan of the counter on Hermann Slimbach-Renner's futuristic, yet humane and chirographic, bold-italic small caps G.

<div class=commentbody>Dan, I agree with Frederik's sentiment in the sense that talking about a person in a personal way on Typophile rather than about their work or their ideas or their comments can quickly become questionable. This thread does look a bit like an invitation to 'stir the pot' rather than an opportunity to further anybody's understanding. Do you disagree?
On the other hand Fredrik, you could of course not contribute to the thread. I should note that it is not always possible to know who is around & who is not *for sure*. So intensive checking every time somebody has a comment isn't actually practical or reasonable.
So what I am saying is 'it's the content'. And 'please keep it civil dudes'.
Thanks.

Here's my thoughts on this:
Imagine Hrant coming back, logging into Typophile, and finding a nice thread that has an interesting collection of his sayings or ideas assembled into one nice little package. In a sense, the history of Hrant IS the history of Typophile (along side others as well.)
And I don't know why I care, since I don't, but doesn't anyone else feel that a mature discussion can be had without people stepping in and saying "Hey, you guys can't do that! You're gonna flame someone!" or even worse, actually flaming someone? Now THAT is out of line.
No flamers allowed. Except James. But that's another topic altogether :)

Surely you must admit that when it comes to a gamut-encompassing passion, Stewf is no hrant. I think you need Armenian blood for that.
; )
Because of that passion, hrant would be near the top of Typophilers I'd like to spend a day with. It would have to be interesting. Especially since he seems to take as good as he gives. Encountering an opposing viewpoint on a controversial subject doesn't trigger hysteria in him, as is apparently the case with some people.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi all,
>Is it just me,..
No, its not you.
When I entered typophile two months or so ago, I needed a few days to realize the presence of two charismatic personalities.
The one is Raph through his silent, modest but very beautiful character designs and the other was Hrant throughout his dramatic good knowledge about the world of typefaces.
So lets look forward what they will have to say in the future..;-)
Seriously, thanks for all the good knowledge everyone round here is willing to share.
Great! Never expected this.

<div class=commentbody>> The King is dead! Long live the Series of Usurpers!
Has this something to do with Fry who is getting sucked by the next king of the planet of water beings? (from a painting frame opening at his back)

Does he now prefer to post at other sites?

I couldn't agree more with this statement.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"the history of Hrant IS the history of Typophile"
If this ís true, I'ld stop reading (and sometimes posting) here at once.
I wish Hrant a good - and a long - time on Zyprus or wherever he is.

<div class=commentbody>What I appreciate about Hrant is all the time & energy he has given to explaining his understanding, point of view, and ultimately knowledge of type to me. I am deeply appreciative. What I was trying to say before was that I want to encourage people on Typophile to continue to do that for each other rather than spending time variously praising or criticizing an individual or each other. I can't make you do this of course, and moreover I doubt that Hrant would agree with me. Still, that's what I think.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Eben,
Agreed. There are many great people here who spend countless hours helping/contributing to this community. Hrant is just one of those people. So, kudos to you all.</div>
