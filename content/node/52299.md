  body: "Have you tried trashing your font cache?\r\nI tried to reproduce the bug
    in Safari (3.2.1).\r\nFirst, I got fine fractions with all Lucidas. However, the
    line set in Lucida Sans Unicode (5.00) swallowed the brackets <strong>and</strong>
    the \u2018N\u2019 in \u2018No\u2019 \u2026 scary! No problems in Firefox.\r\n\r\nAfter
    emptying the system font cache (you can do that with [[FontExplorer X|FEX]]),
    Safari has no problems either:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lucida_6018.png]\r\nThe
    dingbats are just there to check whether the correct fonts are loaded.\r\nF"

  body: "I had that issue once and when I used <em>FontNuke</em> it cleaned the problem
    right up.\r\n\r\nAnother app I used that I highly recommend is <em>Onyx</em>.
    \ There's a version tailored for each version of OS X.\r\n\r\nWhat you have is
    a corrupt font cache, it happens sometimes and a clean-out and restart is all
    it takes to fix.\r\n\r\nGood luck and happy hunting!"
