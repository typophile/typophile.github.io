  have seen them.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/2416920076/in/set-72157604556594949/\r\n\r\nBut
  today I noticed something else. All three of the bases are quite different too.
  This is starting to look less & less circumstantial to me now. What do you think?\r\n\r\nI
  also read that Aldus in the same period \"clearly had no less than seven varient
  forms of the letter \"nu\", five of \"alpha\", \"phi\" and \"omega\", four of \"beta\",
  and \"tau\": in all, the twenty-four letters of the alphabet appear in seventy-five
  forms, while contractions, abbreviations, accents and breathings carry the total
  number of sorts well into the hundreds. The quote is from the Lowry book \"The world
  of Aldus Manutius : business and scholarship in Renaissance Venice\".\r\n\r\nObviously
  this again proves nothing but it builds a picture in my mind where alt r shapes
  may have seemed even that much more plausible."

    to have inhouse type cutters so they made do with what they had. It seems that
    print shops patched together type from different sets and made do with whatever
    they had - and probably borrowed/lent type from one shop to another. \r\n"

    by the printing process? (however if the punchcutter had to cut three different
    lowercase r it's reasonable, for me, that he could not obtain three identical
    bases)"

    r has the 3 spots at the bottom of it''s serif, the regular has a concave shape
    and the truncated one a flat one -  in a pattern or not. I recognize I will have
    to get a lot more data before I can prove ( or disprove ) anything. '
