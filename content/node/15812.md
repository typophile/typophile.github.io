  I almost finish the first weight. I did the spacing and the kearning even if I think
  I have to work again on that part of my own typeface. I wonder which way to choose?
  Do other weight. Do the hinting or something else?\r\n\r\nI'm stock at this moment.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I am guessing you are talking about Postscript hinting. True type hinting
    is another and far more difficult matter.\r\n\r\nI believe the postscript hinting
    should be apart of the typeface from the beginning. It is all about the way you
    place the anchor points. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what software you are using,
    but if you are working in Fontlab, the software calculates the hinting from the
    anchor points placed in the extreme points of the characters. The extreme points
    are the parts of the curve that for a short while are either parallel with the
    x-axis or with the y-axis. This is often the point on the curve that is highest,
    lowest or most to the left or to the right side. \r\nEvery extreme point should
    have an anchor point.\r\n\r\nFrom these, the software measures the stem-width
    and the overshoot, and then decides on the most representative dimensions in the
    hinting.\r\n\r\nYou can also do much more, but this is the easiest.\r\n\r\nHope
    it helps\r\n\r\nSofie\r\n"

  body: I think TT hinting issues - are best dealt with in the context of the intended
    use of the font. Is it meant for screen use? Text? Display?  If screen use is
    relevant - What OS ? Maybe you don't need to do TT hinting at all.

  body: "PS hinting can be done as you go along. If you convert hints to links in
    FontLab, you can even leave them intact while you make most kinds of adjustments
    to outlines, although I usually remove them if I'm doing additional work on a
    glyph, as it is tidier.\r\n\r\nI try to set blue zones (vertical alignment zones)
    early on, once I have established normal x-height and overshoots etc., but I don't
    usually set standard stem values until all the hints are in place.\r\n\r\nTT hinting
    is a different kind of beast, and I wouldn't start this until after both outline
    and spacing design are complete. TT hinting is a kind of additional design phase
    in which you are effectively modifying the design for specific device dependencies."

  body: "I agree with John with this proviso - ( if thats the word I want )\r\n\r\nIf
    you are really designing for screen use in particular ( which you are probably
    not ) but if you are - maybe design some letters & test them with TT hinting at
    the begining so that the reality of rendering can inform your design process.
    Nailing down some essentials in the begining can save you alot of work later on.
    Thats what I wish I had known to do when I started work on my screen-centric font
    project."

    When making dedicated screen fonts, you want to test in the target rendering environment
    as early as possible in the design process to review stem weights and other details.
    When I started work on Constantia for MS, I began by making a Multiple Master
    font with a weight axis for a few key letterforms -- H O i n o, if I recall correctly
    -- and then generated a pile of different instances at different weights. Mike
    Duggan at MS hinted these, and together we reviewed the rendering of the different
    weights."

    of tests for dedicated screenfonts before they are hinted?</em>\r\n\r\nI didn't
    suggest testing before hinting. I recommended early testing <em>including hints.</em>
    But also bear in mind that hinting might not change 'everything' in the target
    rendering environment. Early testing in ClearType is pretty essential, if that
    is your primary target environment, because you can't rely on x-direction deltas
    to tweak things later: you need to know that your letterforms actually work well
    in that environment."

  body: "Of course I write this at the risk of teaching your G-mas to suck eggs.\r\n\r\nBut
    maybe it will be useful to someone...\r\n\r\nDavid when you say 'dedicated screen
    fonts' do you mean bitmaps? Because that is different. Or do you mean an outline
    font which is meant for & designed for screen use?  I think that John is referring
    to the latter; and so he is talking about the way your outlines render to screen
    in the first place. I think he is saying that you want to know that your  basic
    shapes behave well enough before you spend alot of time working on either hinting
    or even other glyphs. Is that correct John?\r\n\r\nMy experience is that hinting
    can change a surprising amount. But it is not the way you want to start solving
    problems - just a way - and often not the best way - of smoothing out rendering
    problems. This is because hinting that is marvelous on Windows in B/W and/or in
    the old antialiased mode may not give such good results on OSX and it's rendering
    engine - or for that matter in ClearType. \r\n\r\nThe take I have on this - and
    I would love to hear if anybody agrees or disagrees - is that you really do want
    to start with good shapes that behave as well as possible in one target OS/rendering
    format. And that while you can have good results in a variety of environments,
    in some ways you have to choose a rendering environment to focus on & then hope
    to mitigate the damage in the others. I have a font I am developing that is attempting
    to bridge the gaps and it's frustrating. I will have to choose an environment
    to make primary soon. Still, it's been a great learning experience.\r\n\r\nOr
    in John's case - maybe they didn't worry about the other rendering environments
    much. After all they were making fonts to establish the value of a particular
    approach to rendering type in the context of LCD screens! Having a contrast in
    results might even have been appealing to them. John, did you test Constantia
    in other rendering environments? If so did you let it impact the design? My guess
    is that the answer is 'No'. Why make the job trickier?\r\n\r\nI think that screen
    rendering environments can be compared to paper or repro technologies, metal vs.
    CRT vs. Postscript etc. A type design that is optimal in one of these may perform
    well in others but really <strong>ideal results</strong> can only occur in the
    niche/context that the face was designed for. \r\n\r\nWhen the apple & microsoft
    environemnts were more similar (OS9 & Win95/8) this was somewhat less true because
    OS9's interpretation of hinting was more similar to that of Windows. But now we
    have the old model TT/PS + Cleartype + OSX's rendering. And they all differ in
    pretty big ways. Plus there is screen rez/density which could change over time
    and is starting to change already.\r\n\r\nAndre, what is the purpose of the font?
    If it's really for print then you could hint at any time since screen use isn't
    central to your purpose. And you can probably get away with auto hint anyway.
    Anybody agree/disagree?\r\n\r\n"

    suitable for use as screen fonts, \r\n>you need to know that your letterforms
    actually work well in that environment.\r\n\r\nYes thanks. Since \"that environment\"
    is every size from 9-27 or so, regarless of x-ht. stem, counter or serif decisions
    you make (within the reason brought on by experince), there are good nodes and
    bad nodes into which the letterforms are gonna fall (sizes that work well, and
    sizes that don't. You can test that, but any changes you make just shifts the
    problem. Really the testing of letterforms that actually work well in \"that environment\"
    should be going on in your mind before a letter's drawn. I.E. is the contrast
    dumbed down enough? are the shapes dumbed down enough? Is the spacing dumbed down
    enough? Dumbing being ness. to compensate for the \"smartening\" of the CT rasterizer.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing that'd help hinters, would be if applications developers understood the
    importance of a finer granularity in the selection of sizes available to screen
    font users. But that's such a good topic it's blog bound."
