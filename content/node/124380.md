  body: Could be wrong but givien the period and the numerous duplicate letters not
    identical, I'm afraid it might be hand-lettered. It looks like some sort of hand-lettered
    Engravers Gothic/Blair/Sackers Gothic. Don't have the time now to gather some
    alternatives but I'll try to find some. The only ones I have in mind at the moment
    are [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/uomo|Uomo]] play ing with both styles
    and alternates.
