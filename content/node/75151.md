body: "Carnet is a new take on the classic British humanist sans, drawing inspiration
  from public signage faces as Gill Sans and the UK's ubiquitous Transport medium.\r\n\r\nWith
  rather wide proportions and pragmatic architecture, Carnet expresses a feeling of
  openness and approachability. At the same time, it sparkles with sophistication.\r\n\r\nIts
  clarity of form makes it perfect for public signage and transportation uses. It
  performs well at text sizes (especially suitable for brochures, instructions and
  presenting information) and is also appropriate for corporate identity projects.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Angstrom-1_4040.gif]\r\n\r\nAll
  comments and crit very welcome."

  body: "Nina pointed out the wideness of /y/ on Flickr... I think the widths of all
    the lowercase should be reviewed, paying attention to counter area. The ball-and-stick
    letters, for example, are quite wide: look at /p/ next to /rag/ in \"pragmatic.\"\r\nThat
    inconsistently appearing wideness is brought out by your (in my opinion) too tight
    letterspacing.\r\n\r\nHorizontal proportions of the caps are good, though perhaps
    /A/ could be narrowed a bit.\r\n\r\nThe techno-ish squareness of /g.alt/'s tail
    seems out of place to me.\r\n\r\nWhat's the thinking behind the short extenders?"

  body: "<em>Hm, you could be right, but I'm rather attached to the large round eyes
    on the bowl-and-stick letters.</em>\r\n\r\nMaybe then it's a matter of widening
    the other glyphs (e.g. /a/r/t/), if that's possible. And as I suggested, some
    breathing room between letters might also even things out.\r\n\r\n<em>g.alt \u2014
    you mean the single storey one?</em>\r\n \r\nYes.\r\n\r\n<em>Short extenders,
    er, I hadn't really noticed! Do you think they might reduce the usefulness?</em>\r\n\r\nDepends
    on the use you're talking about, I suppose. For \"public signage and transportation,\"
    I might think lengthening the extenders would make clearer word-shapes and facilitate
    faster recognition. But other sizes and contexts would have different requirements.\r\n\r\nI
    think you need more weight adjustment when bolding those letters with tight spots
    in their structure. /g/ of course, is the biggest challenge, and it does look
    too dark here. Top of /f/ too. Actually I can see it working well to introduce
    a lot more contrast in the bold than you have here, particularly if \"sophistication\"
    is one of your aims stylistically.\r\n\r\nDid you consider other tittle shapes?
    The square looks a little rigid, like someone snuck some gothic into your humanist
    sans."

  body: "Here we go, I've drawn the bold...sorry no time to make a new pdf today,
    will do soon.\r\n\r\nI made a lot of changes to the regular proportions as you
    suggested, Craig. Bolw-and-stick letters have been narrowed a bit, along with
    c, e, k, s, v, x and y, and widened f, n, r and t. Thanks for that advice, I think
    it's really gelling much better now.\r\n\r\nThe bold got quite a lot wider, and
    I think perhaps it needs even more overshoot still. It's got quite a different
    tone, more like Parisine, Bliss or Milo Sans. I added a bit more contrast, do
    you think it could take even more?\r\n\r\nTittles: I think this started with round
    tittles when I first adapted it from Mint last year. I quite like that gothic/grotesque
    touch in there. I think it must be my fear of softness again![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Carnet-Sample_6380.gif]"

  body: "This is looking good!\r\n\r\nThe width changes you made are really good;
    the rhythm is more consistent now.\r\n\r\nLove the comma.\r\n\r\nRegular /M/:
    I think the upper vertices could be spread out (lengthen those horizontal bits
    at the tops) and let the angled counter underneath ride up a touch. (In other
    words keep the side strokes where they are but narrow the \"V\" in the middle
    - does that make sense?)\r\n\r\nBold /C/ looks light. Bold /L/'s horizontal stroke
    could be heavier, I think.\r\n\r\nThat chevron form of /K/ and /k/ seems out of
    character to me.\r\n\r\nLove the /P/ and /G/ - really a lot of letters to love.\r\n\r\n/A/
    still looks a touch too wide to my eye.\r\n\r\nI don't quite get the arbitrary
    oblique terminals on letters like E, F, L, T. The asymmetry of T's terminals looks
    particularly odd to me. What really doesn't work to me are the terminals on /X/x/
    - the slanted terminals on one stroke and horizontal on the other look really
    unresolved. There's promise in those ideas (it may be close to working in the
    legs of /R/K/k/) but it doesn't seem fully worked out yet.\r\n\r\nThat bold /f/
    looks much much better.\r\n\r\nI think retaining an alternate one-story /g/ would
    be useful. It would lend itself more to the \"delicious roundness\"!\r\n\r\nHopefully
    others will pipe in here too!"

  body: "Thanks Craig, I'm pleased you approve of the changes. You were definitely
    right about the widths.\r\n\r\nComma, yes, somehow I'm quite demanding with my
    commas. It's so easy to overlook but really needs to fit in properly.\r\n\r\nI'll
    take a look at that M, now you mention it, I think that one has stayed a bit too
    close to Mint rather than finding its own voice. Do you see a problem with the
    tiny slope to its downstrokes?\r\n\r\nKk, would you try a horizontal bar or have
    the upper arm joining the stem? Maybe I'll just try both.\r\n\r\nI was thinking
    the A might still be a bit wide, but I like the gradient of its strokes. I wonder
    if I can find a way to keep that gradient while making the overall shape narrower.\r\n\r\nEFLT,
    well, I suppose I was trying to add a more humanist tone, similar to Tankard's
    Bliss (which I'm seeing everywhere these days) or Nick Shinn's recent Sensibility.
    I'll see about reversing the angles or something. Thanks for the observation on
    the Xx, I'll see what can be done there.\r\n\r\nYeah, forgot to tweak the alternate
    g, that's why it wasn't included in this specimen! \r\n\r\nBold /S/ was causing
    some problems. Did it seem happy to you?\r\n\r\nDid you think the bold /a/ should
    be wider? It suddenly popped out at me...\r\n\r\nAnd I wonder if the numerals
    should be a bit wider (first pdf)?\r\n\r\nMany thanks indeed :)"

  body: "This looks like it's going to be a great succes when it's released. Versatile,
    yet plenty of character. You're probably a better designer than I am, so don't
    take my comments to serious. I agree with eliason that the Xx needs some refinement.
    The bold S looks fine to me. I think the bold a should be just a little bit wider.
    All the underneath is for regualr and bold:\r\nZz looks a bit top heavy to me.
    I'd just make the bottom horizontal stroke a bit longer.  The point where the
    two diagonals in the k meet ( < ),  looks a little bit to low to me.\r\nThe L
    seems a bit to wide.\r\nThe curve in the J seems a bit forced, not flowing nicely.\r\nMainly
    in the bold, the two story g looks to dark to me.\r\n\r\nI'm probably one of the
    few designers, if not the only, who thinks this, but I thought to let you know
    anyway:\r\nThe horizontal part of the g optically looks as if it goes up towards
    the right, making it look quirky. IMO it should go down slightly towards the right.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps."

    /S/ was causing some problems. Did it seem happy to you?</em>\r\n\r\nI dunno,
    maybe it leans right--maybe you could try retracting the top end just a touch.
    But I didn't notice it as problematic.\r\n\r\n<em>Did you think the bold /a/ should

    this is getting much better (I hope you agree).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Carnet_5951.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
    widths are getting much more coherent. I've redrawn some glyphs slightly, including
    the numerals (which hint at grotesque forms), the hood of the lowercase |a|, eye
    of |e| and spine of |s|. In the spirit of British wayfinding typefaces there's
    now an alternate |i| and |l|.\r\n\r\nI'll keep tweaking and post a pdf in a day
