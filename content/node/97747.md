  body: "It looks a lot like <strong>Bankir Retro</strong> by Alexandra Gophmann (2006)\r\nNote
    that according to <strong>[[http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-43962.html|Luc Devroy
    pages]]</strong> A. Gophmann specializes in revivals, cyrillizations and digitizations
    but there have been also complaints about her practice of borrowing fonts from
    type designers without asking, therefore I don't know if this font is an original
    one.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI found it using
    Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com\r\n"
