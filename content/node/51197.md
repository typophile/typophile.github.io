body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nMost typefaces were designed for a specific medium. For
  example one will do better in long texts or work better on a computer screen than
  anothers. Now my question is do you know typefaces thet were designed for a specific
  purpose that have been taken over for others\u2026 (frequently) by this i mean that
  they are used frequently in an other context than they were designed for\u2026 So
  they actually work in that context altough it was not the intention of the designer\u2026\r\n\r\nMaybe
  a weird question, i know, but i'm looking for examples and i think there are a lot.
  Please correct me if i'm wrong :)\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\n\r\n\r\nOlivier\r\n"
