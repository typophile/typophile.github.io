    target=\"new\">Script Font ID Guide, Part 11 (Everyday handprinted scripts)</a>
    and could not find an exact match. Two fonts: Irv (pg 4) and Dlnfont (pg 10) were
    fairly similar, but that was the best I could find.\r\n\r\nThis topic is in our
    FAQ, I think, and basically it says that these kinds of fonts are too easy and
    cheap to make, so that examples you see (especially for commercial uses) are very
    likely custom fonts. Your best bet is to find one with a similar feel, and use
    that, because you may never find the exact font you saw.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I searched through Mike's pages last night as well (the 24 above-mentioned
    pages plus the 8 of the everyday handwriting), and I didn't see it there either.
    Nor did I find in on dafont, the place I usually spot free fonts.

    it's a directly related ID. Fonts that look like natural handwriting while maintaining
    legibility are always useful. Here are a few in the style of that Macy's font:\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "Thanks Stephen. I'm not actually looking to ID the font as much as to understand
    how it works - characters repeat sometimes and then don't at other times but it
    is definitely a font, not handwriting. I have not played with open type, is that
    how it works? That there are alternate characters and ligatures?\r\n\r\nSorry
    if I wasn't clear in my earlier post and thanks for the font suggestions."

  body: "Patty,  I'm curious about your Macy's font question, because the only script
    use I've seen is simply the 'way to shop' phrase. Have you seen this script used
    with more variety of words and letters? (I couldn't find anything else on the
    web page link you gave).\r\n\r\nAs for your question about how OpenType handles
    contextual substitutions, the answer seems to be in certain tables that are part
    of the font files. (This conclusion was inferred from some Google searches using
    words like 'OpenType, glyphs, contextual and tables). Here is a <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otff.htm\"
    target=\"new\">Microsoft tutorial on the subject of OpenType files</a> that is
    probably way more than you wanted, but it talks about the various tables that
    are used, including ones controlling glyph substitution. These are what the designers
    must 'program' in order to define when certain glyphs are used. See <a href=\"http://www.talleming.com/pages/work/programming/openType/edInterlock/\"
    target=\"new\">this article about the programming of the 1400 glyphs in House's
    Ed Interlock</a> as an example of what must be done as part of the design of a
    complex OpenType font\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It is used like crazy in their print ads, which were totally unavoidable
    last month in the Times. Some of the characters match up, some don't, there are
    individualized ligatures and stuff. It may have been customized from someone's
    handwriting but since it was used for so many different words/phrases it must
    have been made into a font. \r\n\r\nThat Microsoft article is greek to me, but
    I had read about Ed Interlock before, and seen enough about Open Type to think
    this might be how they got that script to work.\r\n\r\nRe Amy's comment, yes,
    I've noticed the same thing a lot lately, in Chase banks for example. It's the
    font equivalent of that soothing voice in the customer service phone trees: Your
    call is important to us..."
