body: "Having a new appreciation typestyles, I am discovering some significant limitations
  in my MS Works word processor. I would love to be able to change kerning and line
  spacing in very small increments. I can increase line spacing manually by inserting
  a line with no text and making its font size very small, but this is laborious,
  prohibitively so for large documents. Decreasing line spacing appears impossible.
  There must be programs out there that allow whole pages or paragraphs to be modified.
  \r\n\r\nWhat options are there for someone wanting to do more advanced things with
  words on a page?"

  body: "what Hrant says. \r\n\r\nIt is a common misunderstanding nowadays that MS
    Word (or similar app.s) are there to do typography. Though you *can* do typography
    with it, of course, if you accept the existence of limitations. \r\n\r\nOn the
    Mac, I find the humble TextEdit quite handy, for doing more simple posting layouts,
    blackboard-sheets and the like."

    it's tempting to do that sometimes, but it's very bad technique. Will cause problems
    if the text reflows later; you can end up with a blank line at the top of a column;
    and makes it extremely difficult to change the line spacing later. "

  body: Somewhere in the paragraph settings of Word you can control line spacing in
    points. But yes, get InDesign. Word is for word processing. InDesign is for typesetting.
    Big difference, even though Word can produce output that superficially looks like
    typeset text. Hey, maybe this is a better place to throw your money. You can get
    Indesign for a couple hundred dollars, less than the price of some good type families,
    if you're eligible for the educational pricing. AND it comes with a few top-notch
    type families for free.
