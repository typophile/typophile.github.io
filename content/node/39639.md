  programs that would be better for organizing fonts. Also will all of my font families
  become active if they are brought into Suitcase? \r\n\r\nThanks!"

    if not better, than suitcase. Also, the principles are near to iTunes, so it's
    quite easy to use.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX\r\n\r\nFor your
    font families becoming active when added to suitcase, it depands on your preferences."
