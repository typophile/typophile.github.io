body: I have been reading various threads and I am astounded by the depth of the expertise
  found here. <BR> <BR>I am interested in La Figura font ... it sells for $29.  It&#39;s
  not that I&#39;m cheap but I want to be sure that I&#39;m spending my money wisely.  I
  like some of the characters and have application, but find the nature of the font
  in general to be something that I might use once.   <BR> <BR>Guess what I&#39;m
  dancing around trying to get to ... is there a look alike, one of those free fonts
  that you discussed in previous posts? <BR> <BR>Thanks

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>If you want to find free fonts, there are lots
    of places where you  <BR>can find those, but I don&#39;t know if anyone here is
    going to be  <BR>very enthousiastic about rustling up a free knock-off for you.  <BR>Remember
    many Typophiles make a living out of designing type.

    target="_blank"> La Figura</a> from up close, and it&#39;s a <i>really</i> nice
    script with  <BR>lovely energetic strokes, which strikes the perfect balance  <BR>between
    calligraphy and roughness. Completely unlike  <BR>the usual mushy stuff in that
    category. What a pity...'

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  Thanks for the second look.  I felt embarrassed and misunderstood
    when I read your first post.  Your third post is the information I was after <IMG
    SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  Thank
    you for your time and your trained eye to examine La Figura up close.  Your critique
    is exactly what I was after ... I didn&#39;t want to pay for just another script
    that has similar characteristcs of the Zapfino fonts ... unless it genuinely has
    its own identity ... perhaps one I couldn&#39;t recognize.   <BR>Thanks! '

    strokes, which strikes the perfect balance between calligraphy and roughness&#34;
    ... is unique and in my mind&#39;s eye, I could almost visualize the flow ...
    and now I feel that I am spending my money wisely <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
