  font.  It will be for a story about a very left brained individual who ends up going
  on a killing spree.  Some adjectives: cold, hard edged, inhumane, machine made,
  \ unfriendly, robotic, angular, reductionist, geometric.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

    with that one, but hear me out.\r\nHow old is your audience? Are they design savvy?\r\nAre
    they type-literate enough to sense when the unassumingly benign gaze of Georgia
    has caught them?\r\nTo know that hiding behind the strangely and kindly face before
    them is the inner workings of a highly tuned, megacorporation manufactured, killer?\r\n\r\nI
    think Georgia would fit pretty well with the story actually. ha\r\n"
