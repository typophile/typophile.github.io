  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Oh man… I just had a major blast from the past. And I have to confess that I kind of lied on Typophile. :-(  It wasn't intentional, honestly – my memory failed me. I'm not sure that constitues lying, but I'm not particularly proud of it, and I apologize.

I said Ernestine is my first font. Now, while I did vaguely remember that I dabbled around a bit in Fontographer a number of years ago but quickly realized I didn't know what I was doing… I just discovered that I actually completed wonky lc, UC, and numerals, and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.design.graphics/browse_thread/thread/c4fd1f9cdcad081">put "my first font" up for crits on alt.design.graphics</a> in 2001!

Kids, don't do drugs or you won't remember what embarrassing things you did eight years ago. :-|

Well it looks like there was reason enough to forget this, too. What better way to atone for past sins than to show this off in all its glorious ugliness? (Feel free to point your fingers and giggle.) Thanks to WayBackMachine I just managed to retrieve an archived copy of a .ttf off my long-defunct old web site. So this is what it looks like, complete with strange unintentional overlaps, mirrored bpdq, and an "A" that took too many blue pills.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/identb_alphabet_5888.gif]

I guess from now on I'll call Ernestine my "first serious font"…</div>

That is reassuring. But were yours as bad as this? And most of all, did you forget you made them? <:o)
By the way, Steve, if you still have anything of those funky bitmap fonts (any printouts, screenshots?), I'd be very interested. I collect the stuff.

But Steve is certainly right. My first bitmap fonts were decent (it's easy to make bitmap fonts decent, but very difficult to make them exceptional) but here's my first outline font - this is a panel from my exhibit at Montserrat University:

It didn't help that I did the imitation with the naked eye, sans scanner...

But then, to be quite correct: second <em>outline</em> font. I did mention my bitmaps on the Ernestine thread, right when I called that my first.

<em>"Although it’s certainly brave of you to show that..."</em>
It was pretty scary. Then again, this is *so* atrocious that I thought it could really only be seen as funny. (What's not so funny is the comments I got in that newsgroup: somebody called it "nice and clean"…)

Any screenshots would have been lost when my Mac SE died. I'll look and see if I have any printouts anywhere. (The Runic font files may still be floating around cyberspace. I do remember that someone tried to pass off my Runic font as their own when I was in grad school.

It was done for an assignment when I was studying graphic design in college in 1975 or 1976. The concept was a geometric sans based on uncial forms. The letters are 2.5" tall (not counting ascenders and descenders), drawn with a technical pen (ink) on illustration board. Some serious compass action going on there.

		<div class="commentbody">my first one (called "horus") was done solely for a magazine i designed in a college course.
it was done by scanning my calligraphy and has no corrections of vectors (and i'm not saying this as a good thing). it's inspired by my favorite type style (guess what). i barely had time to correct it, 
but i remember i did not want to use an existing font, and it didn't matter to me if i would be wrong, or if the font would be bad. i just wanted my on font!
the kerning of this font is heinous and abominable, i had to do it manualy in the little time i had. to this day, i still don't know how to make fonts (or kerning in font lab).

here is a sample and some spreads of the magazine:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font3_6210.jpg]

These are from about 1990. The first two were drawn directly in Fontographer, referencing paper sketches I did throughout the eighties. The third was traced in Fontagrapher from scans of large drawings I made about 1980. I consider them naïve. They have a lot of design and spacing issues. I learned a lot from doing them. I sometimes entertain notions of resurrecting one or more of these, but my tastes and priorities have other ideas.</div>

Not my absolutely first, but the first I can read text with.
The first was pretty amusing to set as the default serif in my web browser,
as long as the site didn't specify too small a pointsize.

		<div class="commentbody">Fun thread! I decided to dig up some of my really old stuff and play too.

Here's one of the first fonts I ever designed, for an old <a href="http://www.nefec.org/UPM/printers/mepf80.htm">Epson FX-80</a> dot matrix printer. The basic resolution was 72 dpi, but by taking multiple passes you could amp it up. I also, of course, wanted proportional width, which was a big deal back then. I don't have an exact date, but suspect it would have been around 1984, maybe 85. It wasn't my absolute first font (that would have been making new 8x16 bitmaps for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000">Tandy 1000</a>, which was programmable that way), but the first for print.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dotmatrix1_5891.png]

I also did a Hebrew, and got started on a shadowed font too. Oooh, special effects!

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dotmatrix2_4631.png]

But the first scalable font I ever designed was Zaltbommel, intended to be an industrial design, but with very open apertures so it would work in small print. My dad and I called it "Shmuro," as a kind of riff off Eurostile, before he chose the final name. As you can see, it was designed on a grid. I wrote the font editor myself, but that's not so impressive, everything was based on bitmaps at 256 to the em, and then scaled entirely in bitmap space. It looked pretty bad in large sizes. Anyway, the date on this one is "Thanksgiving Day, 1986".

Thankfully, I've gotten better since then.

Here's my shamefull first:

http://typophile.com/node/27678

I've only done a few vector 'fonts' & then I decided I was better off doing bitmap fonts since they make it a whole lot easier to disguise amateurism (although I've done some bad examples of those as well).</div>
