  art store featuring European products. The client wants a contemporary art museum
  feel. The place will have hardwood floors, steel fixtures from the ceilings, etc.
  \r\n\r\nI'm a little stumped at the moment as I had expected it to be an old fashioned,
  Victorian type of thing. Any suggestions on how to keep it super modern yet french-y?\r\n\r\nWould
  love your opinions as this is a great community with good taste! Thanks..."
