  aware of how dangerous bad design can really be? The recent coverage of the new
  Target prescription bottle and Highway Gothic got the ball rolling, but how do designers
  get business to really appreciate that letting someone design better labels and
  containers can prevent disasters? Should we be lobbying MBA programs to teach a
  course in the value of design? Or would it be better taught to lawyers, who might
  advise their clients that this can prevent a lawsuit? Does anyone have connections
  at 60 Minutes?"

    bad design, or just a distracted nurse?

  body: "I blame bad design. Hospital staff are notoriously distracted, enough so
    that now and then someone gets sutured up with surgical equipment left inside.
    So why are the bottles of a drug sold in different strengths not obviously designed
    to reflect the contents? Something as simple as color-coded bottles, labels, or
    lids could make a big difference. So could stating important information right-side-up
    and upside-down, so that when a nurse or doctor flips the bottle to fill a syringe,
    the label can be read during the pause. \r\n\r\nIt just seems like this should
    be so easy, but all I ever see are little glass bottles with simple labels and
    steel lids. "

    someone has done something hideous like give anticoagulants to  random people.
    It's the fault of the nurse, shouldn't that be clear?\r\n\r\nI went to pick up
    a prescription, and the pharmacist looked at my drivers license 4 separate times
    before she actually read the letters of my name, instead of reading what she expected
    to see. Crossgrove isn't the same as Cosgrove, and it's not my fault, or the fault
    of DMV, or type designers, that she wouldn't just calm down for 3 seconds and
    read. There are words in every language that look similar; that's not some kind
    of unfair surprise. Certainly not to someone who has learned a foreign language.\r\n\r\ntheir

    images of Heparin bottles and it seems to be sold in some pretty well-designed
    bottles. Some of which are even color-coded. So it is a user error."

    to start throwing designers into the class action suits they are so eager to initiate.
    The last thing we need is for designers to have to have their work vetted by lawyers
    to make sure that a law suit is not possible.\r\n\r\nLawyer: Sorry, you are going
    to have to set that section in bold, and this section in all caps, and that bit
    over there should be underlined ... twice.\r\n\r\nDesigner: Well, that will look
    like hell.\r\n\r\nLawyer: Sorry, it's that way or you are open to a law suit.\r\n\r\n"

    but I think blaming just the nurse is an extreme argument as well.\r\n\r\nYes,
    nurses should pay attention. Yes, they shouldn't be so overworked. Yes, we should
    use design to assist them whenever we can."

    the importance of design in certain situations where it can and does affect people's
    lives... Like road signs."

    the recent Taser incident at Vancouver Airport</a> was a single comment about
    how badly designed that airport is.  The person said something to the effect that
    it was very difficult and frustrating to find your way around there even if you
    speak and read English and that he could understand how a person could become
    distraught. \r\n\r\nBad design may not be the cause, but it can can lead to disastrous
    consequences. One must to design medicine labels with the understanding that nurses
    will be distracted and airports so that people don't get lost. \r\n\r\nHere's

    how do designers get business to really appreciate that letting someone design
    better labels and containers can prevent disasters?</em>\r\n\r\nThe best example
    I know of this comes from Jorge Frascara. He gave a talk at my university once,
    and told us that where he lived in Canada, collecting statistics of highway accidents
    made the government stop and consider a program to improve signage, its legibility,
    etc. Probably not an example you can apply broadly, since it happened in Canada
    and the government was the client... but it is still a real-life example. Look
    at the Clearview project... It's taken them a while to convince state authorities,
    but they are slowly coming around.\r\n\r\nIt's clients that need convincing, since
    they are the ones with the power to approve these kinds of jobs."
