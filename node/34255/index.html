		<div class="commentbody">I am by no means an *important* designer but have a kind of interesting case study. I was part of a team that was charged with redesigning Betty Crocker cookbooks to make them more upscale - this was in the mid/late 80s. We trained the photographers, reworked all the designs, individualized them, etc. Upshot was they didn't sell as well and so Betty reverted back to their more generic midmarket look. This was before Martha Stewart Living & Real Simple hit the scene; I think the public appetite (so to speak) for more elegant cookbook design has improved since then.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My college's gallery, in a joint effort by our graphics program and the local chapter of AIGA, put together an interesting show a couple of years ago. Titled LOGO [where the first 'O' is the red circle with a diagonal line through  it], the show featured AIGA member logo designs that were either rejected or never implemented. It was a pretty cool exhibit. Some of the work never made it for very obvious reasons, and some of it was actually very very good, but still "failed."</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think you need to define "flopped". If the product wasn't successful, can you really blame the design? It might be easier to focus on redesigns. And there are some baaaaddd ones out there, like Wrigleys gum. But I don't know if it affected sales, and that's what defines a design's success, innit? And there will always be some public resistance to change.

The Saks Fifth Avenue Optima-esque logo did nothing for me and now they are back to a redraw of their original script logo.

Or do you just want to focus on designs that designers dislike?

I loathe the Verizon logo - as do most designers I know, for example, but that doesn't seem to be a problem for them.

Another interesting one, the triangle on the Morgan Stanley logo that Landor got paid umpteen millions to design - and now it's gone.

Or... a friend is rebranding Marriott. I told him I liked the M in the circle and he told me it's considered to be ineffective and they're dropping it.

None of these qualify as either risky or shocking tho.</div>

In the type world, I can think of cases where an "elite" (and generally good) designer made a font for a client but then the client rejected it, or at least never bothered to use it: Unger's Capitolium, Frutiger's Devanagari, and LettError's MTV typeface. But I don't know about your "big risk" here - the designers did get paid.

In type design it's hard to see "big risk" being a factor, since you already know you're not really going to be rich even if your work is successful! You put an inadvisable amount of hours into it either way.  :-/

Maybe you could say Cassandre took big risks with the way he made fonts, like Peignot (which was actually intended as an attempt to reform the Latin alphabet). When these risks didn't pay off, he killed himself.

		<div class="commentbody">Commercial failures are one area that’s interesting, but I’m also looking at campaigns that backfired in one unexpected way for another. For example, both PETA and Moveon.org had their Super Bowl advertisements rejected, mostly because their previous ads had shocked or pissed off so many people that those organizations are becoming persona non grata. Compare that with Benneton, whose ads managed just the right amount of offensiveness to get attention, make people angry, and still stay in print so long that people stopped paying attention.</div>

You might want to look at some of the sports sponsorship for examples of failure, as one team has to lose after all. Examples might be the  tobacco companies that sponsor Formula One cars, but who's logos only appear at 3 out of 17 events, or the Star Wars sponsorship of the Red Bull F1 team a few years back atMonaco, where both Red Bull cars lasted only a few laps - but my favorite of all - the Linux sponsored Indy 500 car that was the first to break down ;-)

I had a client (Fizzy Lizzy) who is now on the 4th design for her product line in as many years. I realized pretty quickly that she'd drive me nuts and we parted amicably, but she had another designer take over, and then had it redesigned again a few months later. I actually like the latest one, it's a vast improvement on the other three. She saw her market share erode to a competitive product with a much cooler design and almost an identical name (Izze). </div>

RE Prince -- for a number of years while living in Minneapolis, the local press (and I think, some of the national press too) did not bother to use his sign/mark name thing, but instead referred to him as TAFKAP. (The Artist Formerly Known as Prince). This despite the fact that he went to great lengths to send special, custom-made fonts of the sign-thingy to every media outlet around, with instructions on installation/use. Yeah, that was most definitely an identity flop.

That one actually worked as intended. Warner was using an insane contract he signed in the late 1970s to force him to put out everything but the music he really wanted to. He was so pissed at Warner that he used a contract loophole to force them to market all of his material under the symbol instead of his name, causing his album sales to tank.</div>

I think Prince used that symbol during a period when he didn't have the legal right to use the name "Prince"....Weird and sad huh. People used to call him "Symbol", since nobody knew how it was supposed to be pronounced. When he got the rights back from his old label, he could use the name again. Not so much a failed campaign as an awkward way to deal with legal restrictions. Not to mention typographically limiting. Though, for a while there, you could download a font with that symbol in it. 

In the case of the soda, and other mass-market items, the very dynamics of competition make all the difference. It's like beta/vhs. Someone has to lose. I'm intrigued with this because it's clear it isn't always the best product or most meritorious that succeeds. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">The very first anti-smoking commercial on TV that I can remember was Tony Curtis walking by a row of people (butcher, baker, Indian chief, etc) and saying to each one "I don't smoke, cigarettes that is."

6 months or so later he was arrested for marijuana and they pulled it instantly.

Celebrity endorsements often backfire for this or that reason.

Anybody remember the OJ ham promos? They didn't last long after the "event". For some reason they didn't work anymore with the tagline "It's the other white meat."

Apologies all around…

		<div class="commentbody">There was the Arch Deluxe. McDonalds decided all of a sudden that it wanted to counter the perception that it appealed only to children's tastes, so they created their vision of a "grown-up" burger and set to work insulting their customers with ads that implied that it's immature to want a burger made to your preferences if you don't like onions. On the design front, the restaurants were filled with hanging signs that all showed close-up photos of little kids making disgusted faces, each accompanied by "quotes" of their reactions to the Arch Deluxe like "It looks gross. It's got all that yucky stuff on it." Somehow this didn't make a lot of people want one. Epic failure.</div>

Ben Johnson advertised milk for the Finnish dairy Valio. Then he was caught and the ad was seen no more...

I was involved with Renault advertising in 1994 and we used a lot of F1 photos. Then Ayrton Senna crashed and we had to make changes very quickly. If my memory serves me right, they had a full page advert in the biggest national newspaper on the sunday Senna died, but thankfully his face or car number weren't visible.

Sorry, that wasn't really about risk taking and failing designers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_LePore">Here</a> is info on the designer of the butterfly ballot. 

According to a contemporaneous CNN story:

"Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Theresa Lepore said she put the presidential candidates on two pages to keep the print size big enough for the county's many elderly voters. She has acknowledged it was a mistake."

From these two stories it seems to be just incompetence, which first hurt a republican (Bob Dole) and then a democrat (Al Gore).
