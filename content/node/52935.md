  ... how would it look a page written in Maghribi, or typeset in \r\na Maghribi inspired
  typeface to [most of] today\u2019s readers?\r\n\r\nHere is a wonderful maghribiMabsout1.OTF
  under construction by Jadli from Morroco\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Magribi-New_4623.jpg]\r\n\r\nHope
  MaghribiMabsout1=Simplified Maghribi will be released soon.\r\nhttp://www.graphics4arab.com/showthread.php?t=598\r\n\r\nFlowers

  body: "Thanks, Aziz!\r\nThe overall layout looks beautiful, to my (still) ignorant
    eyes the type looks stronger than the Hakim Ghazali, but some of the finishing
    looks unwillingly irregular, like it was partly autotraced (some letters seems
    also to join irregularly).\r\nThis brings up an issue about digitizing while mantaining
    irregular and rough finishes with better quality, an issue I have been constantly
    dealing with since 1993\u2026 :=)\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I can't understand anything
    of those graphics4arab pages you are linking\u2026 :=("
