  In the book's colophon it says that the font is called Cardigans, but I haven\u2019t
  been able to find any info about the typeface elsewhere. Can anybody help me with
  more information about this font?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cardigans_01_5564.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/cardigans_02_4870.jpg]"
