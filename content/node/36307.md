  body: if you like serapion, check out the recently released <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/collections-14-anselm-complete">Anselm
    type system</a>, it's Serapion/Sebastion reigned in a bit for text work. This
    would be one of my choices, but does it count as 1 or 2 selections? or am i completely
    over the limit of 5? :P

    heaps. Anselm will be great of course, storm is a great designer, and I really
    like Sebastian and Serapion (which I have been using in the last few days). I
    need to read about Anselm more I reckon."

    I had to do a whole lot of work on it, Victoria University (in Wellington) commissioned
    custom weights of National, National Compressed, Newzald & Newzald display. I
    was also working on Meta Serif at the same time, so ended up kerning a billion
    styles and I'm kinda over them at the mo. I need to let National & Newzald rest
    a while before I can get back to them and kern the SC with fresh eyes. \r\n\r\nNow,
    my list. Hard, but I reckon, in no particular order:\r\n\r\nLexicon\r\nMiller\r\nMeta\r\nMeta
    Serif\r\nNational\r\n\r\nThat would be enough for a year I think. I am a bit hesitant
    about National, but have been using it a bit and quite like it. Most of the time
    I get so sick of seeing/designing my own faces that I can't stand to use them!
    (As Meta S was shared, that's a bit different).\r\n\r\nHas anyone limited themselves
    to 5 faces for a year?"

    be more like a few years, working as an inhouse designer, hence, why I recently
    stumbled on this site for inspiration. Mmm, National, Meta nice.\r\n\r\nTwo that
    I know I could enjoy for a year: DTL Nobel and Tribute. I don't know how practical
    Nobel is for everyday use, but I really think Tribute is beautifully done. The
    other three I would want to use seem to be impractical choices of historical script/handwriting,
    that have been overused anyway.\r\n"

    really know why. I think it just looks very, very balanced in design. Good proportions.
    Somewhat classic, but very modern in execution. Something like that. :)

    but with curves and drama (one of the modern uncials, or perhaps Stone <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stone/munc/\">Munc</a>?).
