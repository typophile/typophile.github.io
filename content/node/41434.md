  \"Do I know of any well known calligraphers in the UK or working from the UK..?\"
  My first answer was not really, but I know a place that will... I understand that
  I can google the question, but I'd never get the 'right' answers.\r\n\r\nAny help
  would be much appreciated, even just a few links.\r\n\r\n--\r\nRez +"
