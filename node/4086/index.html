  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Does anyone have any suggestions for suitable fonts for a book titled 'Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice and 21st Century Potential' (the book presents nonviolent action as a powerful and effective means to wage conflict). Many book covers of a similar genre prefer to use typography rather than a graphical image to convey the message. However, I'm not sure whether the choice of fonts have been accidental. I want a font that conveys power and conflict. Any suggestions and justifications for use would be greatly appreciated&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">K, I would suggest you begin with sketches. Maybe you can find a photo or design that would be appropriate. Then experiment with different faces superimposed on the images. Be careful about putting the cart before the horse. That doesn't work. Suppose we say Gill Sans Bold. How will your copy break? That's crucial to comprehension. But where will the copy be in relation to the elements in the photo, design, illo, whatever? Nail down your imagery first, then think about typefaces. They are interconnected and one size doesn't fit all.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dan &ndash; Obviously I would not limit myself to never using a new face should an occasion arise, but I think an argument can be made that a proliferation of bad faces now created digitally makes more trouble for designers than it helps them. There's a whole other dimension to typographic design which has to do with how a line of copy is set for comprehension as well as aesthetics. Do your instructors at the school get into that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the constructive responses&hellip;I have already created some rough sketches (see link) which I would like to narrow down before presenting to the publisher and author. There are two routes essentially which I have taken, both aim to be simple and bold; the first is with simple graphic elements, and the second is with photographic imagery. My preference is with the non-photographic options that carry a bold headline. FYI, I'm no designer (no kidding!!?), just an editor in a small publishing house who enjoys dabbling in design!

		<div class="commentbody">I really like that first photo (what is it of)? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Actually my initial brief came with the request for the use of the Tienanmen Square photo, as this is one of 23 diverse case studies from the last century (ranging from Russia in 1905, to Guatemala in 1944, the Philippines in 1986, to Serbia in 2000) used in the book. There has been some internal debate as to whether T. Sq is the best example of nonviolent struggle&hellip;not to mention acquiring photographic rights.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My concern with using a single photograph is that it becomes too focused on one event rather than capturing the overall proactive 'emotions' or 'strategies'.
