    Gothique</a> adds additional widths.\r\nEric Olson's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=stratum%20ot\">Stratum</a>
    offers lowercase and two variations, #2 with flat terminals.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/sackers_square_gothic_std_regular/\">Sackers
    Square Gothic</a> predates Bank Gothic for an older, more rigid, yet handmade
    look."

  body: I'm not sure if this works for a tailor, but for something that looks more
    modern, [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_oxide_ot/|FF Oxide]]

  body: Eurostile Extended is nice if your only other choice is Bank Gothic, but it
    could wind up making the product look Trekkie.
