  book project. There are certain limitations on the point-size and number of pages.\r\nWhen
  I substitute the serif body text with a sans serif, the page count exceeds the page
  limit by several pages. I wish to find a sans serif text face that has an average
  line width similar to serif fonts such as Times New Roman. Can you make a few suggestions?
  \ Legibility and simplicity are key.\r\n\r\nTS"

    seem like the secret ingredient, but a large x-height is actually even better.
    For one thing, narrow fonts (like Times) do save horizontal space, but when you
    hit a paragraph break the savings can disappear. Fonts that are wide can be set
    smaller: they will appear just as large as the narrower font, and save vertical
    space on every line no matter the paragraph breaks. And Times isn't just narrow,
    it also has a large x-height. What I'm getting at is this: look for sans fonts
    with a large x-height, and play with the point size to see how it fits your economy
    needs. Just make sure the font isn't saving space by being too tight: that ruins
    readability (like Helvetica).\r\n\r\nBTW, I hope we're not talking about a long
    book, because sans will not work. If you have no choice in this respect, check
    out FF Legato.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
