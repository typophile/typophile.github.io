  body: Hmmm, not so easy for me, I must admit. It&#39;s an interesting challenge.
    I&#39;ll get back to you later on for this one &#40;unless Stephen has to go to
    the bathroom...&#41;. =D

    Office</a> I can taste it. Is this from a street sign, Simon?

  body: Could be a custom logo. The slight curves in both uc and lc &#34;k&#34; are
    bugging me.

  body: hi guys <BR> <BR>so it&#39;s not that easy after all, eh? thanks a lot for
    your efforts so far! <BR>right on yves, the thing is in fact part of a logo that
    i have to work with. there are certain reasons though, why i cannot ask the client
    about it. i was also thinking it might be a custom job. not sure if the client
    would endulge in such efforts though. <BR>stephen, your suggestions are very close
    indeed, but not it, i&#39;m afraid. could in fact be a modification of Fago Office.
    nice font btw! <BR> <BR>simon

    more important than not perfect answer here, no?&#41;, and the s came from Bliss.
    <BR> <BR>so, yes, pure modification!'
