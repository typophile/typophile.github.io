  body: By the way, I had no trouble seeing the image in Safari, but not all browsers
    can display Photoshop files. JPEG, GIF, or PNG is preferred.

    the answer, Mark, I went and checked in Safari and I could see it. Sorry about
    that, Olivier. I didn't realize using Firefox didn't always work for this site.\r\n\r\nKris

    my exemple the grave accent is horizontal while in the Avant Garde Gothic Demi
    it is slanted. Any idea why such a difference?"

  body: The accent in your sample was probably drawn by the designer who used the
    font. That's not one that's ever been in the font.
