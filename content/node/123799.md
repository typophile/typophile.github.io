  ideas - it is obviously similar to courier, but a bit sleeker. It's wider, has ball
  serifs and some egyptienne traits (g, a, etc)\r\n\r\nI feel like i've seen it, but
  can't place my finger on it. The AD on the project is asking for an exact match.
  I've spent many hours coming...close - so bear in mind it needs to be really, really
  close/exact.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
