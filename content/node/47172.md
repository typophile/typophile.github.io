  custom job or does it exist for the masses?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blindness_6222.jpg]

    filter. A similar font: <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_blur_ot_light/?sample_text=POWERFUL\">FF
    Blur</a>.\r\nF"

  body: In Photoshop if you play around with first bluring slightly your rasterized
    type, readjust your brightness/contrast, then adding the noise/dust and scratches
    filter you can get that effect. You will have to play with settings to get the
    look you want.
