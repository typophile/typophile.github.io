    Commercial]] and [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/apercu|Aper\xE7u]] but
    that's far from matching. Would really like to know too. Hard to believe it could
    be a custom job for a (so) small business like this one. Where did you find this
    sample? It could probably be easier to directly ask to the person who did this
    graphic."

    a line and if I get a response, I'll let you know what it is! \r\n\r\nThank you
    for the other links, I ended up loving Reader by Colophon foundry and find it
    to be similar to this graphic as well."

    also about Reader but prefered Aper\xE7u. Anyway, hope you'll get a response from
    the designer (who is? Thanks!)."

    the text, in French, says \"\r\n<blockquote>\r\nCaract\xE8re r\xE9alis\xE9 \xE0

    means \"font under development\" (in progress)."

  body: "Thanks riccard0 and Michel! The font is definitely custom and called Contr\xF4le
    Technique (CT) grotesque, something between Akzidenz Grotesk, Aper\xE7u, Basic
    Commercial and Reader (at least to me ;))."
