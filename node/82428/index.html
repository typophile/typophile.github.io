  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have designed an invitation for the celebration of my daughter's bat mitzvah. To match the grey / x-height / etc. between the Hebrew and the English, I went through a few iterations.

Initially, I was using a script face for both languages; however, I wasn't too happy with the English, so I changed everything but the name(s). Once I spaced the two sides, the Hebrew ended at 9.5/18 and the English at 11.5/18.

Initial typefaces were Fontbit Egotrip (Hebrew) and Sudtipos Adios Script (English). Those are still the faces of the names. The rest of the text is now Fontbit Hadasa New and Mrs. Eaves.

Any thoughts on the height of the Hebrew? OK? Too small? I haven't gone through the text to make sure kerning is correct, but I'm happy to take suggestions.

The sample is attached.

Thanks!

Steve</div>

Other things:
- The gaps above and below the scripty names seem imbalanced.
- The contrast between the Hebrew and Latin scripts is very large, and notably it's much stronger than the contrast between the Hebrew and Latin fonts.
- Mrs Eaves is very poorly spaced; I would go through it all with a fine hair comb.

		<div class="commentbody">First let's start with the Hebrew body text:
1. you could actually make it a little smaller if you like.
2. you could add a bit more letter space (not word space).
Now for the English body text.
1. the kerning is a bit rubbish.
2. I would tighten the tracking.

the script names look great. Don't touch them!

Everyone makes (imo) the mistake of trying to match Hebrew and English. Forget it. They are two different languages built differently. Try to get the English to compliment the Hebrew. They don't have to be the same colour. Think of it as trying to put to shapes next to each other which are not the same size. They don't have to be the same colour to look nice. You can have a dark grey shape next to a light grey shape and they will look lovely. But if you try and have two greys that are nearly the same, then it becomes very difficult.

That's my two cents worth (with British spelling :-) )</div>

It's true that too often there's too much formal congruence imposed across scripts. But just like with anything else, you can't simply ignore that two things are sharing a space. For example, if you made the English text small and lighter, you would make your non-Jewish guests feel inferior.

		<div class="commentbody">I think that the Latin-alphabet script typeface is legible, and does not need to be replaced. I can't really comment on the legibility of the Hebrew one, but it doesn't appear to be likely to be unreadable.

For a formal invitation, it is reasonable to use a Roman typeface with a small x-height. But doing so is what has created the problem with the invitation; the Hebrew takes up a small proportion of the space, and yet it already looks visually larger than the Roman.

Since using a typeface with a large x-height for the Roman would simply be inappropriate, I think that one has to simply live with this contradiction. Thus, while I would suggest increasing the size of the Hebrew text from what it is in the example, I would suggest only a very slight increase, so that the line widths of the Hebrew text remain somewhat smaller than those of the English text.</div>
