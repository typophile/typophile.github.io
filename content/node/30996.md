  Calibration. At the time I wasn't really concerned with calibrating in regards to
  printing. Things have changed and I'm working on dual monitors and outputting often
  to a laser printer. I want to be able to calibrate both monitors and the printer
  to get exact colors (or as close as possible.) The dual monitor set up is a 17 inch
  CRT and a 17 inch LCD. I don't know if it's possible to match them exactly or not.
  \r\n\r\nFrom what was mentioned in the earlier topic, I looked into the <a href=\"http://www.pantone.com/pages/products/product.aspx?pid=108&ca=2\">Pantone
  Eye-one Display 2</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.colorvision.com/product-mc-s2p.php\">ColorVision
  Spyder2Pro</a>.\r\n\r\nI'm curious which these would meet (and exceed) my needs?
  Do any of you have any experience using them, are they easy to set up and is the
  software simple and intuitive? Are there any alternative solutions? "

    correct profiles is huge. It really helps with high end inkjet photo printing.
    I have not been printing as much recently. I brought the spyder in to callibrate
    my dual PC monitors at work and it also helped. Though loading the profile was
    a little trickier. CRT and LCD might be hard to match together, but you can certainly
    callibrate both profiles to be as good as corrected or \"true\" as possible. \r\n\r\nIm
    interested to hear others responses on the Huey. . . "

  body: "I have a CRT at work and an LCD at home. They are a different beast. I much
    prefer the LCD for both sharpness and accuracy. Regarding matching them--you can
    get them reasonable but don't expect an exact match. I would be more concerned
    with how your printer matches and how the measured values on a PDF match than
    getting both screens perfect. Decide on which screen will be your final match
    best (for me LCD) and use that with your printer. Printers are the tricky ones
    with so many variables. I also use the Colorvision. The first time you use it
    is the hardest. After that, you know the drill. If I really want to test tricky
    cmyk color builds, I send it out to a good proofing house.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    profiles to match my commercial printer's equipment? What would I need to ask
    for for that? "

    a regular printer they're usually very good about such things. It's very possible
    they're using something as mundane as US Coated SWOP (v2).\r\n\r\nYou can get
    both your monitors calibrated but really you should rely on one most of the time.
    \ Pick the best one and go with that. Let the other be a pallette monitor.\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: "I use a Huey at home and it does a great job correcting the blue-cast that
    is endemic to Dell notebook displays; it's simple to use and sits unobtrusively
    on my desk to take 30-second readings of ambient light. The problem, of course,
    is that it is only capable of one profile, so my dual-monitor set up can either
    be calibrated for my external LCD or my notebook display, but not distinct profiles
    for each (I should have shucked out the dollars for a calibrator that could handle
    2 displays).\r\n\r\nAs for printers, I've attempted a number of times to sort
    out printer calibration and every time it makes my head hurt. If anyone has a
    link to a good and reasonable tutorial on this, I'd be much indebted."
