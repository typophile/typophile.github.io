  obviously been altered, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of the typeface this was
  based on? Something with a circle inside the capital \"P\"...the lowercase \"e\"might
  have been rotated. The original logo was designed in 1989 if that helps.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: Probably Avant Garde Gothic Bold. The dot inside the P (which probably began
    life as an O) was added. The r is a modified n; the s is a mess; and, as you suspected,
    the e has probably been rotated.
