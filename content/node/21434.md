  logo \"Joe Fortes\" I beleve it is a custom script created for the logo. \r\n\r\nI
  have been looking all over the place and cant really find anything that is close,
  any font experts have any thoughts?  I need to write a headline for a promo piece
  that matches.\r\n\r\nCan be licened or free.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
