  body: "Well, I always thought that Univers works beautifully with Bodoni. I usually
    use the ITC version with three optical sizes 6,12 and 72. I also think <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/index.php\">Walbaum
    Text</a> from <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/\">Storm Type</a> would be a
    good pairing as well.\r\n\r\nI haven't used Univers enough to provide any further
    suggestions."

  body: "A year and a half late but for anyone doing searches.\r\nThe perfect pair
    to Univers is it's sister font: A slab serif called serifa. It is basically a
    slab serif based on Univers and the two typefaces work tremendously well together."

  body: Pretty much any serif face will work with Univers, choice depending on whether
    you want to match Univers' tone (vanilla) or add a bit of flavour. For small sizes
    of course you want something fairly sturdy. Storm's Baskerville Ten Pro is one
    of many that would work.

  body: "Univers and Glypha work really well together, as they should: both are Frutiger
    designs. I prefer Glypha to Serifa because it's a bit stronger weight in the strokes.
    I've used them in both directions: Univers for titling, captions and headlines
    with Glypha as the body copy font, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nWhichever one I use
    for titling, I find there are benefits to range tracking to make it look fresher
    and a bit more contemporary. I use 1 point of condensed tracking for a 24 point
    font size; 1.5 for 36 points, etc...Then add pair-specific kerning where needed.\r\n\r\nGlypha
    75 also works well as the titling font with other Egyptians as the body copy;
    e.g., I've used it with Canada Type's Clarendon Text to very good effect.\r\n"
