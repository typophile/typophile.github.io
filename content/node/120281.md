body: "I'm setting an extended text in Dolly. I like it, but I don't think it works
  well for headings, so I'm trying to find a suitable face for the headings.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I've been trying so far has been Fontin, which shares some of the calligraphic characteristics
  of Dolly that make it distinctive. However, one opinion I've gotten is that it doesn't
  provide enough contrast, being too similar without being the same. Because Dolly
  is a face with strong character, it may be worth having a strongly contrasting style.\r\n\r\nI'm
  tending towards using a sans serif for the headings. Since there are going to be
  multiple consecutive lines of headings, it's important not too have anything excessively
  blatant."
