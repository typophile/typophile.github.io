body: "Here is the front cover (left) and an insert (right) for the first draft of
  my wedding invitation. Just looking for some feedback. It's certainly a challenge
  finding the right pair to go with Ministry Script. Any feedback would be appreciated.
  The paper will be brown and we will most likely have the type foil stamped in a
  light blue (brown too dark for letterpress).\r\n\r\nThe wedding will not be overly
  formal and will be in Vail, Colorado. Outdoors.. think nature, aspen trees, pine
  trees, rocky mountains, mountain creek, etc.\r\n\r\nI'm curious why some of the
  characters don't seem to align/connect with each other with 0 tracking?\r\n\r\nThe
  verbage isn't dialed in yet nor is the upper/lowercase, etc. Also looking at ampersand
  options for the cover. Again, just showing an initial draft for feedback.\r\n\r\nMinistry
  Script, Bodoni Twelve EF, Frutiger Black Condensed\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inviteshow1_6138.jpg]"

  body: "It's a very nice invitation. Feedback:\r\n\r\n1. I don't think you need both
    a sans and a serif font to pair with Ministry. Just use the Serif.\r\n\r\n2. on
    the front I'd put the location and date in the serif font. Just leave your names
    in Ministry. Ministry doesn't read easily at such a small size and the cover will
    look more balanced.\r\n\r\n3. The serif type on the back looks just a little tight
    - maybe open the leading a point? I'm not sure you need \"Wedding Ceremony\" either.
    If you remove that you can open up the rest of the type.\r\n\r\n4. Don't you need
    \"to\" in between the names on the back?"

  body: "I like this \"as is\". Everything looks great. But, I think you should consider
    moving the address down to align with the line base \"Wedding Ceremony\", basically
    being on top of it. Maybe \"Wedding Ceremony\" shouldn't be so big. I would use
    only the Script and Bodoni 12.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndre"

  body: "Overall, I like it.\r\n\r\nI disagree with pattyfab regarding your use of
    serif and sans fonts apart from Ministry.  On the front, I <em>do</em> think the
    sans works better, but perhaps ever-so-slightly larger. I agree with pattyfab
    on point 2 though, the location and date are far too difficult to read at that
    size, try replacing with the sans font.\r\n\r\nOn the insert, I think the periods
    after Mr and Mrs look jarring, but maybe that's just because I've been reading
    the <em>Economist</em> lately... I don't know if it's okay to omit the period.
    I am American, and I know the convention here is to have the period after Mr and
    Mrs, but I think it would look better without.  Maybe someone else will comment."

  body: "I like Bodoni with Ministry.  Like some others here, I don't see the need
    for Frutiger. \r\n\r\nMight it be possible to use some of the alternates in Ministry
    to vary the look of the names between the cover and the interior? I don't have
    it, but I understand there are quite a few alternates and ligatures, and you might
    be able to get a more hand lettered look if you explore a bit. For example, the
    sample at Veer seems to show a \"er\" ligature, or at least a contextual alternate
    \"e\",  which you're not using.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why you set all the
    Bodoni in small caps... I think upper and lower case would be more readable and
    more pleasant, especially because I find the caps too big with the smallcaps.
    It might be just the screen shot, but the cap \"M\" in Mr. and Mrs. seem disproportionately
    large. If you do stay with the smallcaps, I'd at least use the UC ampersand in
    \"Resort & Spa\". To my eye a small ampersand looks out of place in a mixed line
    like that."

  body: I don't mind the Bodoni small caps but agree that the caps look too large.
    Can you run it in all small caps?
