    get it? I would think you\u2019d get it quicker than most."

  body: "The font has an Anglo quality, rather than Germanic: it is Bitstream's version
    of London Text.\r\nSo I'm afraid the allusion \"Blackletter = German\" doesn't
    work for the typographically informed.\r\nI immediately thought that as an anglo
    style, it represented Keynes, not Weimar, which contradicts the article's content.\r\nBesides,
    for a graphic designer, \"Weimar\" suggest Bauhaus, not V\xF6lkisch.\r\n\r\nA
    modernized (sans) blackletter (e.g. Tannenberg) would have worked better, but
    I suspect that would have required a font purchase, and the Bitstream font was
    on hand, bundled or in a folio.\r\n\r\n"

    Bloomberg reader interpret the word \"Austerity\" set in a fancy Anglo blackletter
    as connoting \"German\", or would there be a semantic conflict between the meaning
    of the text and the type style? \r\n\r\nIn general, designs that work on multiple
    levels, from lay to pro, are best.\r\nThat isn't over-thinking, but professional
    due diligence."
