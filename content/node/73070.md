  use on the internal pages of a book I am designing. The decorative CAPS are to be
  used as DROP CAPs in the lead paragraphs on various pages. \r\n\r\nI do like the
  embellishments of Purissima B&C (D is getting too decorative...), but I'm hoping
  there may be even better (!!) options that are similar. \r\nNot too embellished.
  \r\nModern. \r\nAnd ideally with an italic typeface option as well.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts???\r\n\r\n"
