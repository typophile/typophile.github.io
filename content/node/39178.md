  body: Hey, you already posted this ID. You are risking annoying the hell out of
    Yves here. Etiquette says you bump your previous thread up again by adding a comment
    rather than reposting it (maybe read the FAQ next time?). If you didn't get the
    ID you were looking for it may mean nobody knows the font. The script in particular
    is probably not a font per se, just someone's handwriting. The other two are blackletter
    fonts you could do a search at myfonts.com and see if anything turns up.
