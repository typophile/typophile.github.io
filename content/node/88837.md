  but haven't been able to identify it.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/youzee_6095.png]"

    to me.\r\n\"you\" could come from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/avant-garde-medium-bold/|Avant-Garde]]
    Medium, \"zee\" from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/heavy/|Futura]]
    Heavy or \"z\" from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/heavy/|Futura]]
    and \"ee\" from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/avenir/black/|Avenir]] Black.\r\nThe
    more I look at the /z, the more I think it has been customized. Thickness of the
    oblique bar looks \"strange\".\r\nIf I had to recreate it, I would start from
    Avenir Black (e looks better), cutting the /y tail and moving some points on the
    /z or, from [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura-no-2/futura-no2-d-demi-bold/|Futura
    no2 Demi-bold]] using a 180\xB0-rotated /n to recreate the /u."
