  in making this forum what it is !\r\nHere is what I'm dealing with...\r\nI've been
  looking for ages for this rounded font I've seen on many schoolbook covers from
  the late 70's- early 80's. -____- ...\r\n\r\nI went through Myfonts and identifonts
  with no results...\r\nhttp://wtf2.myfonts.com/uploads/images/81/81b845e4ba288cfbe7e3845a6572b4fb.28613.jpeg\r\nhttp://wtf2.myfonts.com/uploads/images/34/34a54a9fc16c6a2c292626b7e406fd2d.34803.jpeg\r\n\r\nYour

  body: Indeed but with Glowworm, you have that kind of shiny reflect that appear
    on the font. I thought the font I'm looking for belonged to the same typeface
    company but didn't.

    I'm wondering if it didn't appear in old Mecanorma catalogues. Is there anyway
    to access old catalogues from the 70's or 80's ?\r\n\r\nthx"

  body: I have an old Mecanorma catalog and you're correct in thinking they might
    be Mecanorma fonts. The fonts in question are Zelek Bold and Zelek Boldline.

    loonking the name of these fonts for ages. Where can I buy these ? (if they are
    available). If they're not, is there any identical/similar font that has been
    renamed ?\r\n\r\nMany thanks !!\r\n"

  body: There's another font in a different style by the same designer called New
    Zelek that's available from ParaType, but as far as I know these have never been
    digitized.

    but this font has nothing more to do with the old one...\r\n\r\nOne day maybe...
    Who knows... rounded fonts seems to be trendy these days...\r\n\r\nAnyway thanks
    a lot for your help ! I appreciated ;-)\r\n"

    that were put on CDs for Dover Books does not include anything by any of these
    names, and the Solotype Catalog shows primarily film types, I think.\r\n\r\nMy
    understanding with regard to Zorro is that it was a proprietary font designed
    for Wired magazine, but I suppose you could write and ask.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    interest though and sorry not to be of more help.\r\n\r\n\r\nI really hope that
    one day all the zelek font family will be digitized as it should !\r\nThese fonts
    have been requested so many times on the Internet lately.\r\n\r\nAnybody interested
    by scanning them from an old Mecanorma catologue and digitized them under a new
    name ? lol\r\n\r\n"
