  body: I believe  <a href="http://www.faces.co.uk/products/fonts/view.cfm?productsku=IN10136"
    target="_blank">this</a> font, here called Sisman, is what you&#39;re looking
    for. It&#39;s also called Lys Calligraph, Lysandria, Windsor Sword &#40;you can
    buy it also <a href="http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm" target="_blank">here</a> but
    not sure if it&#39;s Mac or PC&#41;.

  body: As far as I know Lys Calligraph is the proper name for the typeface, as that
    is the name in both the Solotype Catalog and the Phil&#39;s Photo book. Lorrenne
    was the NovelFonts digitization, and I can&#39;t find any site that carries anything
    more than one or two isolated NovelFonts any more.  Lysandria is circulating as
    freeware at a number of sites, but you will need to find them on your own because
    they have other questionable fonts at some of these sites. Sisman is apparently
    one of the David Rakowski scanned fonts, originally offered as freeware, now being
    sold by Intecsas. <BR> <BR>It was a photo-type that exists now in several digitizations.

    thread</a> in November had more information.

  body: Considering that this is the third request we&#39;ve had for this font in
    as many months &#40;not including my off-line correspondance with you, Mike&#41;
    I think it&#39;s about time someone did a proper commercial digitizationof it.
    And of course called it by it&#39;s proper name.

  body: It&#39;s tempting to agree with you, but who do you know that wants the job?
    Considering the number of versions floating around, even with wrong names, does
    the world really need another one? <BR> <BR>If someone was able to do something
    like ligatures and alternate characters, that might make it worthwhile as a font
    purchase.  I see Dan Solo is back in the font making business. Do you think he
    would want to do it?
