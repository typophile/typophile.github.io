  body: Colin,  <BR> <BR>Are you looking for the small sans serif font at the bottom,
    or the large white all-caps font? I say this just to get the ball rolling, because
    I looked for the smaller one yesterday when I first saw the post. I used my <a
    href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html" target="_blank"> Sans Serif
    Font ID Guide</a> using the assumption that the bar of the &#39;e&#39; is horizontal,
    and couldn&#39;t find it. I will try again with the assumption that the bar is
    not horizontal, and see if I see anything. The &#39;W&#39; is the most distinctive
    feature and the curved &#39;l&#39; and round-bowl &#39;y&#39; are also good &#39;field-marks&#39;
    for ID purposes.

  body: I just looked in the Sans ID Guide for something with a sloped &#39;e&#39;-bar
    and found nothing that comes closer than Font Bureau&#39;s &#34;Berlin Sans&#34;,
    and I know it&#39;s not identical. This is a sans font I haven&#39;t catalogued
    yet, so it makes me think it&#39;s either very new, or from a small foundry.  I
    know I have a long way to go yet for the sort of comprehensiveness I want in that
    Guide, but with about 700 sans families catalogued, it should be a significant
    part of the commercial fonts you might expect to see.

  body: Either/both. Mostly the bottom one. It has some interesting features. Too
    bad I don&#39;t have a bigger image.

  body: Top and bottom could well be the same. I checked the  <BR>recent releases
    at Fonts.com, the sans serif sections  <BR>at T-26 and Garagefonts, and the FontBook,
    but nothing  <BR>yet. This one has me intrigued. <BR> <BR>And for some reason
    I keeping coming back to <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=10641530472884578&amp;fontname=Hermes"
    target="_blank"> Hermes</a>  <BR>by Matthew Butterick. Which it is not.
