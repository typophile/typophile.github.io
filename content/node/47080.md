body: I'd appreciate any help in naming and locating this font.  As memory serves,
  I was given it, used it once, then evaporated it from my files.  Now, of course,
  a client has seen and is love with it. [And as you can tell from the file name,
  my typing is also erratic.]

  body: "Something i try to do when naming is... know the influences or something
    like \"what does this remember me...\"\r\nFor example, on my Hausi the name went
    through a long way. It remembered me of Bauhaus, then it came me across Bauhausian
    and... then Hausi!\r\nIt's a easy way to name it ehehe...\r\n\r\nJoel Santos //
