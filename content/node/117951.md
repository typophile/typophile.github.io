  body: "The upper bowl in the second a is larger than in the first a, which indicates
    lettering, or an engraved letterhead. \r\nBut this is a nice blackletter design.\r\nWe
    can find some similar fonts.\r\nDon"

  body: "Most definitely hand calligraphy, and I've had no luck approximating it with
    a single font.\r\n\r\nNotre Dame comes close for the lowercase letters:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/notre-dame/
    \r\n\r\nCaslon Gotisch may be a place to start with the capitals (though they'll
    need a lot of editing):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rmu/caslon-gotisch/\r\n\r\nIf
    you absolutely have to recreate it cleanly, I'd suggest hiring a competent calligrapher,
    then digitize the results.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, I found a piece of Barclay stationery
    from 1944--similar style for the nameplate, but not a match to your sample:\r\nhttp://www.schulsonautographs.com/pages/books/2452/cole-porter/typed-letter-signed-4to-on-the-barclay-hotel-stationery-philadelphia-nov-29-1944"

  body: "Good find Kevin for the 1944 letterhead. Presumably this was an earlier version
    and almost certainly engraved. The scale is small, but from what I can see, it
    is a more flowing rendition. The newer _B_ is clunky compared to the earlier one.
    The bottom loop of _B_ in the earlier version is in a classic Fette Gotisch style,
    and its top is more elegant. The top of _l_ is graceful rather than clunky. _T_
    is different, the later version is more flourished, and looks good except for
    the confusion in the center.\r\nBTW I went through my image collection of several
    hundred blackletter character sets and found nothing that would be worth using
    as a single source for editing.\r\nI agree that its best to re-letter the words
    and digitize the results. It's up to you whether you want to recreate the later
    or earlier version, or a hybrid with their best features.\r\nDon\r\n"
