  body: It's well exectuted, but I think you should show more glyphs to give a better
    idea of what it could look like.

  body: Actually, there is no other glyphs right now since it was made for a logotype.
    I just tought it has the potential to go further.

  body: 'This is probably no help, but I REALLY LIKE IT! The image caught my eye on
    my blogroll and I thought: oooh, new font? Download! But, no, it''s in development.
    It has a nice neo-modern (is that even a word???), nostalgic-yet-novel look to
    it. The only piece of feedback I could maybe give is that something about the
    "a" and the "d" are too ordinary to me...maybe if there was a TAD more "character"
    to them (excuse the pun). For example, I feel that the "a" seen alone could be
    confused with many other fonts of lesser aesthetic value than yours here. The
    "d" also feels like it could be a little more unusual, but not too frilly. The
    "K" and the "f" are my favorites. OK, I apologize if that was completely unhelpful.'

  body: Thanks a lot Bernard and Jeanne. I still don't know what's going to happen.
    I'm showing a bunch of logotypes mockups to my client on thursday, but I should
    definitely develop this solution as a typeface. Never designed a script before
    though. I'm already a bit familiar with OpenType's discretionary ligatures and
    alternates, it might help.
