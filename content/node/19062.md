  crew and was looking to get some suggestions for typefaces to help kick start a
  Ligature. The Dance Crew's name is the Groovy Gees (GG will be their mark) The mark
  will be used on the following: Business Cards, A Website, t-shirts and 59Fifty Ballcaps,
  such as this: http://images.footballfanatics.com/productImages/_106000/FF151333-s.jpg\r\n\r\nFor
  those of you that do not know what funkstyle dance, here are a few videos of what
  it looks like: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uixvoZ5PSls\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP-BJ72ZsBc&search=poppin%20pete\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYf0O7c0y1U&search=poppin%20pete\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHO-meQlGKU&search=campbellock\r\n\r\nAs
  for style, they're heavily influenced by hip-hop culture, so basically they wear
  baggy tee's, pants, and ballcaps as listed above. As for the ligature, they want
  to associate it with MLB Logos (LA Dodgers, Boston Red Sox, Atlanta Braves) but
  with  the following qualities:\r\n\r\nGroovy, Funky Feel (less ridged, and more
  fluid)\r\nHand Written Feel\r\n\r\nAny suggestions are welcomed! Thanks in advance,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    tools for a job like this, a typeface isn't really going to help because the Gs
    will be the same and you won't be able to get fluidity from them on a computer
    as quickly as drawing.\r\nTim"
