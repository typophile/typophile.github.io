  body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nSorry, I don't understand the relationship between your company
    and the leaf/feather motif... if you're confused as well, work out the essence
    of what your company does and use that as a basis for your identity. It might
    be that a wordmark will suffice or you go down the using-your-company-intial route.
    I'm afraid nothing's jumping out at me: there seems to be a lot of polish (everything's
    had the full illustrator treatment with gradients etc.) and not much substance.\r\n\r\nSwitch
    off your Mac, get the pencil & paper out and force yourself to come up with a
    notebook page of ideas. Then weed out the ones you think are strongest. Then switch
    the Mac back on!\r\n\r\nSorry to be critical - it is constructive criticism, I'm
    not trying to put your work down; I'm really looking forward to seeing new ideas.\r\n\r\nSi"

    body: "Thank you very much Simon. Your critique is useful for me. \r\n\r\nBut
      you know, I could not think about icon of my logo. My company is software provider.
      The logo company, at first used some icons like CD, mouse, etc inside logo.
      But it's not good icons for my company because we produce high level products.
      I thought that CD icon may be logo of CD burning program.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you
      suggest some icon for using in the logo? What do you think about text-only logo?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n"

  body: "The designer(s) certainly gave you a lot to look at here!\r\n\r\nI agree
    with Si, in that I am unsure of the meaning in the leaf. I'm guessing this is
    something you requested though, as it is in most of the designs. I don't know
    what it says about your company and the products you produce. Sometimes it seems
    just tacked on for no reason -- like in #3, 5 and 7.\r\n\r\nAlso, in most of these,
    it is hard to determine the focus. Is the graphic or the company name more important?
    In nearly all cases the relationship between the graphic element and the text
    is weak, in my opinion. \r\n\r\nThey all feel like they're <em>trying</em> a little
    too hard. Maybe something simpler -- for example, just a leaf graphic next to
    the name with no attempt to be clever about it being part of the 'R'.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I think the text in #3 is the strongest. None of the graphics strike me as memorable
    though.\r\n\r\n<em>Edit-a-bit</em>: to close a wayward tag (sorry!)\r\n"

    body: "Thank you very much Lauren. I used of lead because simply I could not find
      other element to use. As Dan mentioned may be it's better to use text only logo.\r\n\r\nWhat
      do you think about icon or element that I can use for my company? I can't find
      a icon for software company. We produce 3 strategic product: making help file
      for computer program, taking screenshot from computer user and making demo file
      (SWF) from applications. All of our products used by other companies and developers.\r\n\r\nI'm
      a poor man ):\r\n"

  body: "I think #1 is a strong mark: It is unique, simple, vaguely evocative of tools
    and technology, and makes an \"R\" without having an obvious plain old \"R\" sitting
    there. It's the sort of mark that could stay fresh for a long time as your company
    grows. The type, however, all looks like it was randomly thrown together.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem with these designs is that there are always three different elements competing
    for your attention: the mark, the word \"Rasa,\" and the word \"software.\" The
    effect is confusion. Instead, there should be two. That means either (A) eliminating
    the mark, (B) eliminating the word \"software,\" or (C) making \"Rasa Software\"
    into one element, by setting it in one typeface in one size on one line.\r\n\r\nThe
    name of your company makes me think of \"tabula rasa,\" the blank slate. The #1
    mark is somewhat suggestive of the corner of a tablet/screen and a stylus. If
    you're going to try more marks, that may be a concept to explore further."

  body: "I find designing icons difficult - for the simple reason that they have the
    difficult task of summing up a concept in a very minimal way and communicate this
    efficiently. It seems from what you've told us that the company's field of work
    is quite diverse; to this end it would most probably be a strong solution to use
    a distinctive wordmark approach. I'd lose the leaf as it adds nothing except serving
    to confuse and pare everything down. Also a good idea would be to ignore the colouring
    at this stage and get something strong which works in black & white; keeping it
    strong and simple will let it work down at small sizes (which if you want something
    to appear on a OSX/WindowsXP desktop icon) will make the transition a lot easier.
    Think simple, not complex. If you look at most well-known brands, they work very
    well small, in single colour at their most basic.\r\n\r\nI like the Rasa name,
    in itself that's a good start. Such a distinctive name should lend itself to a
    wordmark well."

  body: "Thanks very much. here is a very intersting forum. I learn from pro here
    a lot. I think duckworth is true. I decide to lose leaf and think about Rasa word
    itself.\r\n\r\nBut I have a very big problem in layout. layout of logos that designed
    by logo company are like this:\r\n\r\n    R  \r\n R a  s a\r\n Software\r\n\r\nlayout
    of logo number 12 are like this:\r\n\r\n++ Rasa\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about
    layout. I think it is not very standard. I see a lot of famous brand at <a href=\"http://www.brandsoftheworld.com\">Brand
    of the world</a> website. they are always horizontally. but my owns are vertically.\r\n\r\nHow
    elemts exist at the logo like Rasa word, Software Word or R icon must arranged?\r\n\r\nDoes
    someone have a idea?\r\n"

  body: "Many logos are set horizontally, with an icon to the left ot right of the
    name. I believe this is done more often so the logo can appear larger when (vertical)
    space on a page is limited. It's also just natural to \"read\" this way. \r\n\r\nSome
    companies have both a horizontal standard design, and an alternate \"stacked\"
    version for when space is limited in the other direction. This can get confusing
    though to have different versions of your logo.\r\n\r\nYou need to think about
    how your logo will be used. Which way makes more sense for your Web site, packaging,
    products, other promo materials?\r\n\r\nEither way is \"correct\" if it works
    for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't know that you want to take the 'brands of the world' web site too
    seriously. It is no measure of quality in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI didn't really like
    any of the logos in the PNG. They were all too complicated, and worse without
    any purpose or reason for that complexity.\r\n\r\nWhat Lauren Engelhard was saying
    about logo configuration is correct. There is often a horizontal & a stacked or
    'vertical' version too. For instance both Starbucks Coffee, Microsoft do it. The
    main reason is that the name is long. This doesn't mean that a clever designer
    can't help you avoid the having two versions especially if you have a short name
    - but if not it's not a problem if you end up that way.\r\n\r\nI suggest that
    you simplify the logo to the word 'rasa'. \r\n\r\nYou don't need to explain what
    you do in a logo. That is a common but sophmoric mistake. Beside what you do may
    well change in the future and a description could undercut your flexibility.\r\n\r\nI
    suggest a simple but robust type face with no ornamentation \r\n\r\nTry for instance
    typing RASA here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.net/samplers/shires/derbyshire/index.htm\r\n\r\nIf
    you like it you can buy it here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.net/type/shires.htm\r\n\r\nThis
    idea may very well not be the best one, since I haven't thought about it for too
    long.  I suggest you listen to Simon Duckworth and simply begin again with a pencil
    but with one addition. Think carefully about what the logo is mean to do for you.
    What impact do you want the logo to have on your business? Think of the logo as
    an employee. What's his job exactly?\r\n"
