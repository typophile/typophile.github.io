body: "I\u2019m happy to announce that the CoreHumanistSans family has grown. It now
  features three new styles: Italic, Light Italic and Bold Italic.\r\n\r\nDue to requests
  from users the existing three styles have also been updated. They now contain a
  second set of tabular lining numerals that are equally high as capitals, and a more
  conforming variant of the euro sign.\r\n\r\nYou can check out all styles at FontSpring
  now.\r\nhttp://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fonts-by-alex/corehumanistsans\r\n\r\nAn
  updated type specimen can be viewed here:\r\nhttp://www.fontsbyalex.com/images2/CoreHumanistSans_specimen.pdf\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CHS2_4496.jpg]"
