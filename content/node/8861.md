  &#40;the M&#41; I realized I had been fooled. A deadringer for its true identity
  would be great. And if someone knows what inspired or was used in &#34;Pizza&#34;...
  that would be greater. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63814.jpg"

    If the same person did the whole thing, that might explain the difficulty in pegging
    the font used for LAMPPOST.

  body: Colossalis is even closer yet. That might be the way to go.

  body: Hehehe, the S made me check Colossalis as well, but the M  <BR>put me off.
    It could have been customized tho.

  body: i think the highlight is causes the visual bend in the S ... however i will
    agree that the M isn&#39;t quite right

  body: PhotoShop&#39;s bevel/emboss filter creates round corners ... I still think
    it is City with the M altered.

  body: True if this was stroked and then beveled/embossed, it would have created
    a rounding inside the counters.
