  hee. Sorry, eeeek.\r\n\r\nHere is the latest updates (pomonapdftwob.pdf). The drippy
  C and G is a little less drippy. I also expanded it, it felt a little too compressed
  while I was working with it. Thanks for the critiques and please keep them coming.

    apex.\r\nI believe the colour of the text should be nice the weights of the stroke
    seemed balanced to me. My only concern as far as letterform is concerned are the
    lower serifs on E, L, Z and z. It's too abrupt."

    it is a beauty.  Just, one suspects, a matter of taste.\r\nmgk"

  body: "Excellent work. I really like the over look. The Kk in particular and also
    the French ampersand are quite nice. Here some comments. I find the lower bowl
    of the g too small, that letter should have more \u201Cpersonnality\u201D. At
    my point of view it's seems too timid. It could be a bit larger. The top of the
    G could be a bit wider, the S would be more open on the top or the drop is too
    low, Finally, overall the typeface are slightly condensed, but some letters (B,
    R, K, S) looks a bit extended compare too other T, M, N, V, W). Keep going."

  body: "I love this! Really elegant and charming! The ampersand and numerals are
    especially delightful!\r\nI'm sorry you've reduced the drippy terminals on the
    C and G, which I think were really lovely and I think perhaps the balance of the
    forms is a bit lost (G especially looks a bit bottom heavy).\r\nF may be a little
    wide? And maybe S too?\r\nDescender of j could maybe have a tighter curve on the
    right side?\r\n1 looks a little light?\r\nDelicious! Looking forward to seeing
    this continue :)"
