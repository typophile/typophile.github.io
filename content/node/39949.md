  in the middle of a class project , where we have to research a somewhat well achieved
  illustrator \r\nthe style of my project is very rigid , very clean , and very swiss
  , so i hoping to find a set of icons created by one designer that would match the
  style . \r\ndoes anyone know of any resources to find an archive of icons , maybe
  used for airports or train stations , that one designer  would have overseen ?\r\n\r\nthanks
  guys \r\n\r\n"

    to the design section of a bookstore or library will be enormously helpful in
    your research. Even using Google will be helpful.

    has some information, and published a great brochure that I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll
    send out. At least two good articles have been published about Vialog\u2019s symbols
    in the last six years (In Metropolis and PRINT).\r\n\r\nAnd while you\u2019re
    at the Linotype site, buy their catalog\u2014a quick look through it would have
    been a great start to your research. It\u2019s a steal even with the cost of shipping
    it to the states."
