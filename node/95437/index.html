  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">As I am well aware, my behavior of late has been inexcusable. My descent into madness began a little after this blatant, unpunishable and unstoppable character assassination of my brand was posted on the Craigslist Philosophy Forum. Combined with a downward trajectory in font sales, an inability to launch a separate, totally error-free adjunct revenue stream, a gamble that I wouldn’t need health insurance until I reach 65 next year, and having nothing of value to support my wife, should she outlive me, I went a little nuts. In fact, nuts enough to make my wife feel compelled to by institutionalized, rather than live with me.

<!--<img src="http://www.nicksfonts.com/depot/adios.png" />-->

Finally, yesterday, a blood test revealed an unexpected anomaly in my liver function put the figurative last nail in the coffin. I hereby surrender: the big money rules. Make me an offer for my complete collection (over 1,000 finished fonts and almost 200 abandoned in various stages of production) in a manner that will insulate my soon-to-be ex-wife of any tinge of guilt by association for my insufferable crime of disagreeing with the reigning sociopath in an online forum.

Your money, my life’s work: name a price, and the two lunatics will consider—once she is released.

P.S. Mods—be sure to delete the evidence, especially if it is for MY protection. Wink-wink, nudge-nudge.

I appreciate your sentiment and your efforts to assist where most others would not dare.

I also have ten or twelve boxes of type specimen books, sign-painter's manuals and related bibliophilia which I had hoped to offer to the Library of Congress (many are not in the collection, and the only copy of BB&S catalog #25 is in the Rare Book Room, which makes access limited and tedious. For obvious reasons, the name of the donor will now read "Anonymous."

Even my plans to donate the remainder of those books not accepted to colleges and universities in doubtful, except as noted. Good thing I don't qaulify for tax deductions anyway.

However, I am reasonably confident that the three million+ people who downloaded my free fonts will continue to download them, ask for free tech support and/or figure out a way to make a buck on a free gift of love…but not contribute a dime in appreciation. Wow.

Even better: all evidence of malfeasance have been removed from Craigslist PhiFo. Blank pages indicate massive eradication of content. Except where I saved the pages offline. Maybe a bit of paranoia is in order, Or not.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can relate to the part about tech support for free fonts wearing you down. You make free fonts and in return you get a full email inbox every day for the rest of your life. It's not without its rewards but it's just relentless.
If I could do it all over again, I'd make them all public domain and release them anonymously.

Is there a possibility you could nuke this thread and present the sale of your font collection in a more professional way? If anyone is going bankroll this it'll probably be some corporate types rather than one of us indies. I can't picture the cock going over well in an inter-office memo. Or maybe, I dunno.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, sorry to hear about your difficulties; sounds like a very tough situation. 

If you don't mind a suggestion, I'm sure that in your city there are social service agencies that can offer free advice and assistance to those who have financial, medical, legal, and other issues. You mentioned you're in your 60s, so a phone call to your local senior citizens' organization might be a good place to start, as they could suggest which specific organizations might be able to assist you. 

My church works closely with similar organizations in my community, and I've seen many fine people who found themselves in tough situations who were helped by these organizations.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, a little simple suggestion:

In Dafont, you can easily add your Paypal email account and start getting donations right away. (LogIn -> MyAccount -> Donate Link)

All the donations goes 100% to your account, and usually range from $5 to $25.-
Given that you have 113 fonts and about 5000 downloads per day, I guess you will get many donations. They are small, but can accumulate quickly and provide you with some extra income.

In my little experience, people are always happy to donate when provided with the Donation button. I will also happily donate and encourage all my social network to donate as well.

But anyways here I go ...

oldnick, things don't always work out. Good (and bad) people get run over every day, people get used up to their very death.  It happened to my father (as an only son dealing with that is entirely another thread), I won't bore you with the details.

oldnick, your work will speak for itself, take solace in that!!!
