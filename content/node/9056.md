body: Hello, typophiles.  I am a designer currently working on screens for a satirical
  takeoff of American network news channels &#40;FOX, CBS, NBC, etc.&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Does
  anyone know what fonts are typically used on these channels for the &#34;infolines&#34;,
  meaning the bars at the bottom of the screen that deliver key information, e.g.
  names of places, people, &#34;Breaking News&#34;, etc.   <BR> <BR>It&#39;s fairly
  obvious these fonts are fairly plain, condensed sans-serif fonts, but I can&#39;t
  seem to find any that really nail it.   <BR> <BR>Any help would be appreciated.

  body: You might want to contact Joe Clark or David Earls - this seems to be up their
    street. I see a lot of what looks like Helvetica Black, Frutiger and Myriad -
    even Trebuchet was a favorite for a while on one of the networks.
