  went to look for WIRED but it's a US magazine so I don't know if I can get it around

    the chance to present, compare and synthesize views on everything from the future
    of computing in art and design to social justice and the politics of technological
    superiority.\r\n\r\nit's heavily blogged and many of the presentations can be
    viewed online.\r\nyou can start at the boingboing coverage and trace the links
    from there.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.boingboing.net/2008/02/29/ted-2008-paul-stamet.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&domains=boingboing.net&sitesearch=boingboing.net&q=TED&btnG=Search\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=TED+presentations&btnG=Google+Search\r\n"

    to meld science, terroire, futurism, environmentalism and commerce in a maturing
    culture like the US.

    that phrase.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry to leap out of the forum at anyone's opinion, but
    I am of the opinion that there is a whole kind of conference, and this is not
    new, that I find, and have found, to be deeply superficial, narrowly hypocritical...
    and broadly hilarious. But, I've mostly resisted.\r\n\r\nAuthor Paul Stamets,
    bless his heart, \"...mushrooms can save the world\", not unless they can learn
    to grow in sea water, not to mention that they're breathing my air. Undersea explorer
    Robert Ballard, brilliant guy, lots of people Do Explore the Oceans, stop taking
    pictures, haul up some of them battleships, lower sea level, make reefs. Todd
    Machover, genius, is gonna make sure that no rich parent will survive, and no
    rich child will be left behind, by Star Search. And I don't mean to 'peck' at
    you but Joshua Klein master of machines, why is he building a vending machine
    for crows to deposit coins, for peanuts...some future web model?\r\n\r\n\"Writing
    in sand is probably our best bet.\"\r\nSand? For one to impress such an audience,
    one'd need to design and 'draw' a new font, liiive, in ones own blood.\r\nMaybe
    next year.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is that several types work symbiotically with the roots of trees and provide nutrients
    that fertilize the trees. It is a very important issue with forestation and the
    paper industry because if the mycelium can be kept alive it reduces or eliminates
    the fertilization needs for tree farming. So David, the mushrooms are helping
    to make the air you breathe and are probably a huge factor in keeping a steady
    supply of breathable air."

    of their area of interest they should say nothing ? you must be kidding. it's
    called research and exploration. this is how ideas germinate, expand, cross-pollinate,
    fertilize, inspire, and evolve. it's an organic process and conferences can provide
    a concentrated dose of exposure, contacts, and inspiration. \r\n\r\nsorry none
    of them are good enough for you. perhaps next year we should all just ask you

    but what I did not clarify is that mycelial mats are the root structure of the
    mushroom. The mats are the worlds largest organisms, and their fruit, so to speak,
    is the mushroom."

    the number of times, the presenter says, \"what if\". Like, what if \"everybody\"
    put all kinds of text data and metrics matching data into all their photos, and
    then gave them away for free! Or, what if everybody had enough memory and bandwidth
    to browse a glabobyte of data on their computer in ten seconds...What if Operating
