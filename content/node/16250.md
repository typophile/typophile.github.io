  body: "The lowercase characters are just Monotype Corsiva (a.k.a. the Zapf Chancery
    stand-in) rotated backwards a few degrees. It looks like the \"ng\" was rotated
    as a unit. The ampersand is Times New Roman. The two S's appear to be Garamond,
    stretched a bit horizontally. \r\n\r\nThis is not what <em>I</em> would call fine
    typography. An interesting amateur effort, though. (Sorry for the dismissive tone,
    but that's my honest opinion.)"

    body: "Sorry Mark, I forgot to add the \"sarcasm emoticon\". Impressive detective
      skills, though. I only got as far as (slightly squished) Monotype Corsiva.\r\n\r\nThis
      was in a guide for an event I attended with my girlfriend's family -- who thought
      I was kind of nuts for going off about \"crimes against type\" for several minutes."

    a relief. I thought it was hideous and I was starting to feel sorry for you. You're
    new here, so I wasn't quite sure you weren't serious. People sometimes do think
    such things are cool.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to convey a sense of humor online.
    In person (or even on the phone), people can (usually) tell you're kidding. I
    resort to emoticons more often than I'd like. They are useful in a dumb kind of
    way."

    would have a longer double take before getting the joke. The downside is, some
    people would perhaps be hurt or insulted so I err on the \"dumb\" (most of the
    time).\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Perhaps we need a new system of "emoticons that don't suck". I occasionally
    think of using existing ones, but then for some reason feel like a 14-year-old...
    and then there's the occasional and unwanted addition of jittery graphical icons.
