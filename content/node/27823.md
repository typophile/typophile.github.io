body: "Just kidding.\r\n\r\nBut I'm looking for some ideas on a sans-serif face for
  a logotype that is well crafted enough to be timeless but different enough to be
  cutting edge.  Something with a humanistic feel but yet has a solid geometric foundation
  (yet without being too cold).  Something that speaks to the gallery crowd, but yet
  has some street cred as well.  Fun, but not tacky. Something that says fine art,
  but isn't as old-school and used to death as Futura.  It should have a tiny hint
  of elegance, however.\r\n\r\nI guess this can begin to sound like the search for
  the perfect sans serif after all.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts are well received. I hate
  asking these questions, but at the same time I'm green to this frontier and submit
  myself to the masters.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDC"

      why humor is necessary, because this is indeed a question that will get some
      intriguing and useful responses.\r\n\r\nI suppose the point of this thread is
      more on the lines of 'put us up on some new stuff we may not know about.'\r\n\r\nScala
      and Avenir are oldies and goodies, but I suppose I'm looking for something that
      has a bit more edge.  Something with more flare points.  I know what kind of
      sound I want, but couldn't tell you any chords."

    with small caps, text figures and glyph palette large enough to give Minion Pro
    a run for its money, and I think it is pretty close to ideal. Grotesque, but not
    autoclaved like Helvetica. The full typographic accoutrements make it suitable
    for book type and, by extension, sophisticated smaller bits of type. V3 is not
    yet released, but it shouldn't be too long. If you get the regular version, you
    can upgrade later. So I recommend it as something new and good, and an alternative
    to the current deluge of Gill-esque humanist sans faces. \r\n\r\n"

    Johnston Sans</a> as a contender. Also Jeremy Tankard's <a/href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/bliss.htm\">Bliss.</a>

    how clients do that \u2013 revert to the original (boring?) plan after asking
    the designer to consider so much else besides. I'd swear they do it on purpose...
    \r\n\r\nSince I put that earlier post up I had a chance to closely compare the
    Neufville, the Adobe Linotype and the Bitstream version of Futura, but I hadn't
    thought to include either the PL Futura Maxi or the Drescher Grotesk. To my eye
    the counters in Futura Maxi b,d,p and q as shown at the Fontshop font detail link
    do indeed, look egg-shaped. But not the o. If the x-height got increased but the
    type design attempted to stay true to the geometry then something had to give,
    right?\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm loathe to suggest it, <a/href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=Avant+Garde\">ITC
    Avant Garde</a> is often treated like a Futura with a greater x-height (maybe
    that's why my students like it so much: ).\r\n\r\nEven with the revamped Futura
    scenario my money would still be on <a/href+\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18&subpage=nfeatures\">Neutraface</a>
    or  <a/href+\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/verlag/index.html\">Verlag,</a>
