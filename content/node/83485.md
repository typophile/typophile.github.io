  came with some typefaces. Some I identified, but other no...\r\nCan you help?\r\nSorry
  if they are too many in just one post.\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipo1_4905.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipo2_5520.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipo3_3463.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipo4_6411.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipo5_5784.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipo6_5228.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipo7_5832.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipo8_5268.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tipo9_3769.jpg]\r\n"

    by the way. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure that I can help identify any of them but I'm
    almost entirely certain I have the same woodtype A and S from No.8. Or at the
    least, very, very similar. \r\n\r\nAlso, No.3 is absolutely gorgeous.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    absolutely jealous. "

  body: "darrel,\r\nThe #7 only has those letters...UNIAO that is UNION in Portuguese...Perhaps
    not a typeface it self but the letters for a old newspaper title with the same
    name in the region (but did not get any confirmation about this...)\r\n\r\n\r\nHmmm...This
    is beeing dificult. I tryed all in \"what that font\" but no results...\r\nAnyone?\r\n\r\nAF\r\n\r\n"

    out, I'd try Flickr. There's a several flickr groups that have photos of lots
    of wood type catalogs.\r\n\r\nFor example, Nick Sherman (who hangs out here as
    well) has a great set of Hamilton specimen books:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/nicksherman/sets/72157600353791817/with/540132013/\r\n\r\n"

    these as coming from American wood type manufacturers. I believe that what you
    are showing are all from European sources\".\r\nMy question now is: do you know/have
    any type specimens online of European foundries that produced type in wood?\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
