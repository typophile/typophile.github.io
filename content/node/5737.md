body: 'I&#39;d like your help in identifying a font that John Baskerville would recognize
  at his own and be glad, and that is &#34;transparent&#34; and serviceable. <BR>
  <BR>I have ITC New Baskerville; as popular and as useful as it may be, it&#39;s
  almost generic and not very much like a Baskerville. I also have Berthold Baskerville
  which I like. But both lack the cursive italic caps. I also have Monotype Baskerville;
  why do the cursive italic caps in italic disappear in italic bold? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  familiar Lange&#39;s Berthold Baskerville Book,  Storm&#39;s John Baskerville, and
  Baskervile Classico; the most  &#34;Baskervillian&#34; it seems to me are in that
  order. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not wedded to absolute historical accuracy, although I would
  like the font to have some character without being quirky &#40;sometimes I find
  lower case italic &#34;z&#34; a little annoying, depending on how far below the
  baseline it&#39;s drawn&#41;. I want the font to be really useable for text and
  occasionally for display. <BR> <BR>Since John Baskerville is dead, we can only guess
  at what he would and would not like, but since most of you are more knowledgeable
  than I am, and have at least seen or used more Baskerville variants than I have,
  I welcome your informed opinion. '

    it to easy or too hard? Or doesn&#39;t it conform to the name-that-font-from-this-picture
    format?

  body: I can only speak for the reason why I didn&#39;t try to answer.  <BR> <BR>It
    sounded like any answer we could give would be nothing more than subjective opinion.
    Who knows what your idea of a &#39;true&#39; <i>Baskervillian</i> font would be?
    You said you were already familiar with most of the Baskervilles out there and
    found them lacking. <BR> <BR>This is the Type Identification Board, where we see
    a picture of some type and try to identify it.  <BR> <BR>There are other forums
    at Typophile that are more along the philosophizing lines your question seems
    to want to go. It might have been better to post it on one of those forums, although
    we have had our share of philosophizing here, goodness knows. <BR> <BR>Your criteria
    seemed much better defined in your mind than they were likely to be in mine, and
    with Baskerville dead, who could give the &#39;right&#39; answer? <BR> <BR>I would
    have said Fry&#39;s Baskerville, because I am not sure that Baskerville originally
    had an Italic face. But that&#39;s me.

  body: 'I&#39;m new here but have read a lot on the type identification board, and
    am truly amazed at not only your collective identifying skills, but you knowledge
    of and about fonts as well. <BR> <BR>I did say &#34;most of you are more knowledgeable
    than I am, and have at least seen or used more Baskerville variants than I have,
    I welcome your informed opinion.&#34; <BR> <BR>And I did really mean that. I only
    learned about Baskerville Classico and John Baskerville from this forum. But I
    haven&#39;t used them, and aside from my non-expert opinion on their &#34;Baskerville-ness&#34;
    I really want to know from people who have used them &#40;and other Baskervilles&#41;
    if they liked them in a text setting. <BR> <BR>I do know enough enough about typography
    that examining letterforms doesn&#39;t tell me diddly-squat about how the font
    looks typeset on a page. <BR> <BR>I asked because I respect the opinions and expertise
    of the regulars who post here. '

  body: 'If one of the things you were looking for is &#39;authentic&#39; Baskerville,
    that should be found in the one John just mentioned. In his description of the
    font in the &#34;Indie Fonts 2&#34; book, Franta Storm says: &#34;Until recently,
    the story of this typeface ended with mediocre digital versions, which did not
    get at the root of its inspiration. We selected as the most successful models
    for the digitization of this typeface its Roman and italics in the size of about
    today&#39;s 14 points, which Baskerville used for the printing, among other things,
    of his folio Bible in 1763, and Vergil&#39;s works in Latin in 1757.&#34;  <BR>
    <BR>Yet he also states later in the same commentary: &#34;Even creators of genius,
    however, make mistakes, sometimes, and, therefore, in spite of the fact that we
    officially speak about &#39;a transcription, &#39; what was involved in the case
    of all complementary designs was a fairly fundamental reworking. Our aim was not
    so much to be reverently faithful to the  original, as to preserve the spirit
    of the typeface and breathe new life into it.&#34; <BR> <BR>So there you have
    it, faithful, but reworked.  <BR> <BR>Isn&#39;t the point really whether you like
    it? This is not a question with a right answer. If you like it, and if your client
    likes it, who else do you want to please?'
