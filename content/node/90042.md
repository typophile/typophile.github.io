    about that 6/9 pair, since it''s basically the same rotated form.'

  body: "In the case of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FF_Scala\">Scala</a>,
    opening up the counters definitely adds to its intended use. Martin Majoor conceived
    the typeface at the end of the 1980s with low resolution output devices in mind
    (such as the 300 ppi desktop laser printer). Hence also the slab serifs. So, a
    kind of ink trapping, indeed \u2014 or rather \u201Cpixel trapping\u201D.\r\n\r\nBut
    the open counter of P has a much older, palaeographic origin. (Deviate the \u201CRoman\u201D
    (= Old Italic / Western Greek) \u03A0 (Pi) from the Greek \u03A1 (Rho).) Cfr the
    Trajan capitals, most Garamont interpretations, Palatino, &c."

    be rendered differently depending on size,\r\nclosing entirely below a certain
    threshold*, completely\r\nchanging the character of the design.\r\n\r\n* And this
    threshold will furthermore\r\nvary depending on the character since\r\nthe size
    of the gap varies.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
