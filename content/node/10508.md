body: Hi everyone. <BR> <BR>The design studio I work for has just upgraded to the
  new 2.5 G5 systems and Panther10.3.9. we had been using 0s9 on G4&#39;s but they
  gradually started to die.  <BR> <BR>Basically im looking for advice on font management
  within our new environment, over the last couple of days I have read much on font
  management within OSX including PDFS from extensis &#40;as we have suitcase 11&#41;
  explaining how to remove font from certain areas in osx and leaving other etc. Having
  followed these guidelines we are still experiencing problems, font conflicts with
  certain applications, unexplained crashes etc etc. <BR> <BR>IWe would really appreciate
  advice or reccomendations on how any of you guys organise fonts on your systems
  or directions on where i could get some more help. <BR> <BR>regards  <BR> <BR>Rob

    management alternatives: Font Reserve, Font Agent Pro, Master Juggler, etc. <BR>
    <BR>Keep in mind as well: it sounds like Tiger, which is out in a few days, will
    have new font management features.'
