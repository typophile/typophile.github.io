body: Is there anyone to use this font Lao MN without the 'Lao' scripture being incorporated

  body: This appears to be a mash-up of Optima and Times New Roman, with a lot of
    customization. It's particular to Lao MN--I don't believe it lives as a typeface
    separate from it.

  body: It's just Times with all the serifs removed and modifications made where necessary
    to make the glyphs look good.
