    His site is difficult to browse, but the reward for your work is that all the
    fonts are, I believe, free for personal use.\r\n\r\nhttp://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein/index.htm"

  body: "It should be mentioned that the German word \"Fraktur\" was not in use during
    the centuries, when the Fraktur typefaces were in use.\r\n\r\nWhile the huge,
    multi-volumed Grimm's dictionary\r\n\r\nsee http://woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB\r\n\r\nincludes
    the word \"Schwabacher\", it does not include the word \"Fraktur\".\r\n\r\nTherefore,
    you cannot find an old handwriting specimen of the word \"Fraktur\" drawn in Fraktur
    letters.\r\n\r\nFor details see www.sanskritweb.net/fontdocs/walbaum.pdf\r\n\r\nNota
    bene: This refers to general dictionaries only.\r\nSome old typesetting books
    used the word \"Fraktur\".\r\n\r\nIn 1793, Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf used
    the word \"Fraktur\" repeatedly in his book \"Ueber Bibliographie and Bibliophilie\",
    but before 1850, the word \"Fraktur\" was not common in German dictionaries.\r\n"

    are two styles of blackletter (the other two being \"textura\" and \"bastarda\").\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>\"fraktur\" and \"schwabacher\" are two styles of blackletter</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIf
    you look at the 22 languages using the latin or the cyrillic script (excluding
    simple english) that are offered as alternatives for the Wiki entry <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter\">Blackletter</a>
    (left pannel), 20 of them call those fonts \"Gothic\", one uses the word \"Gebrochene\"
    (which for me conveys a meaning close to fraktur) and one (Latin) uses \"Litterae
    fractae\". \r\n\r\nDo you really think the English term \"Blackletter\" is  of
    any help here?\r\n"

  body: "Terms are helpful in proportion to their acceptance. I myself don't mind
    revising [my] terminology (for example I'd love for people to start calling the
    Nazi swastika \"hakenkreuz\" instead) but the reality on the ground is that those
    other terms you mention* are virtually unknown. Now, it might make sense to call
    it something else in another language, but we <em>are</em> presently using English.\r\n\r\n*
    Especially \"gothic\", which means \"sans\" to many people.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Wiki entry <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter\">Blackletter</a>
    nevertheless starts with  \"Blackletter, also known as Gothic script, Gothic minuscule,
    or Textura\" and the entry <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans_serif\">sans-serif</a>
    says explicitly that the use of \"gothic\" for \"sans\" is outmoded."
