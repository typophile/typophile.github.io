[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ff-vs-cufon_4394.png]

If it were not for the pinch zooming on iOS devices, it would've been Cufon all the way.

--

If you sell font licenses for the web usage, please <em>please</em> make them Cufon friendly. No self-respecting pirate will ever care to convert obscured Javascript outlines back into mangled OTFs, when it is far easier to find the originals on torrent sites. But having a Cufon option <em>will</em> make the fonts far more attractive and useful to the web designers.

If you are set on a service business model with recurrent charges, consider offering Cufon .js the same way you currently offer @font-face files. In the end this is not about paying less or more, it is about having a website look the same on all platforms. Something that is currently <em>impossible</em> to do with just the @font-face.

Anyway, embracing and delighting in the differences is going to make for greater happiness. Learn to love ugly - I'm amazed at how forgiving people seem to be about it when it comes to fonts.</div>

That's been a long asked for thing from folks but that's just not what the web is about. The best way to describe it is that web design is about suggesting a design...rather than controlling it. 

That said, yea, Web font rendering still has a way to go on many platforms, so I don't blame you for switching to Cufon.

And gee, so touchy on the username! Sorry if my playfulness offended you.
Me, you can mangle Richard Fink any way you want. With a last name like Fink - and especially for someone who grew up in an era when the word still saw quite a bit of <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fink">usage</a> - learning to take such things in stride prevented many a black eye in the schoolyard.
And hey, check out House Industries <a href="http://www.houseind.com/fonts/ratfinkfonts">Rat Fink</a> fonts! Very cool.

Oh. I missed <em>not</em> in your question, my bad. The main problem with SiFR is the Flash dependency, especially considering the proliferation of FlashBlock and similar plugins.

--

I am mulling over writing a replacement rendering engine for Cufon that would outsource the rasterization to the web server. In other words when it would come to actually drawing text on the canvas, it would instead talk to a web server, have it draw that text into a .png instead and then fetch and display the resulting image. Basically a form of <a href=http://facelift.mawhorter.net>FLIR</a> that works as a drop-in replacement for Cufon.

If I am to take the idea a bit further, this could actually be wrapped in a service run by the foundries themselves. And under the very same recurrent billing model used for @font-face licensing.

--

@Darrel - I should've said "looking good across all platforms" rather than "the same". Not achievable with @font-face in larger sizes at the moment as I'm sure you know.</div>

1) Other devices are getting that too.

How important is this really? But I do agree that: it should look stylistically appropriate and readable on any platform, and at least at small sizes onscreen that can come darn close to meaning "consistent".

Uh, no.

I agree that Flash dependency is non-ideal. But to me Flashophobia is much worse, especially when a developer falls for a shiny corporation's thinly-veiled excuse for Making More Money.

And the main reason some developers are anti-Flash now is that they're emotionally attached to a brand, not least because they are also emotional <em>users</em> of "cool" gadgetry. Their consumerist loyalties overpower their pragmatism.

Personally, I'll take lazy over dishonest any day. And I'll take a company that cares about type over a company that ignores hinting and produced a Comic Sans clone.

Using @font-face, except for the fact that one needs to do it differently for different browsers, is probably better.

Anyways, I experimented with it. TeX Gyre Schola worked perfectly. Goudy Bookletter 1911, however, crashed it. That face has some coding issues, and points are missing at extrema according to FontForge, so the fault likely lies in the font and not Cufon.</div>

Of course, Cufon has serious limitations. CSS has to be used for leading - that isn't really a limitation, except that CSS is slightly more awkward to use with it. But the big limitation is that you can't have it substitute multiple fonts, giving each font certain tags - although there's a workaround involving a fancy JavaScript utility that turns various scripts on and off.

The fact that the technique it uses means that people have to "view source" to copy text off the page... that will annoy people, and start some on their first step to becoming hackers. For some content, of course, it's largely irrelevant.

Of course, for an open-source font, embedding is not required, and so @font-face probably is the right way to go for most purposes.</div>

That a little tinfoil-hatish implying some proprietary scheme on Apple's part. OK, that's all fine and dandy, but Flash is proprietary Adobe. You're arguing for one using the same argument to argue against the other. 

The reason people chose not to use Flash isn't due to some Apple kool aid. It's due to decisions Adobe has made. Apple choosing to not use proprietary web plugins in their mobile browser just sped things along a bit. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I admit to being fanatical about some things. In this context about corporations that go too far in usurping the gullibility of consumers, while making "we're the good guys" a central part of their image - that's a bit much! Of course any corporation tries to make money, and cannot be totally honest, but different companies have different business ethos, and to me some of them are simply too far from common decency to be tolerated, no matter how shiny and friendly their products are. Really, being fanatically pro a corporation is much worse than being anti. It's not like I'm fanatical about MS, Google, or any of the handful of corporations that I think are doing some good, socially responsible work.

BTW, the way I see Apple now is exactly how I used to see MS in the 90s. On the other hand, even back then MS used to care about type, while Apple hasn't cared for many years now - and frankly I don't grasp how this sad reality can be glossed over by people on a forum that's fanatical about type.

Thank you, thank you so much for this link! FreeType on Windows, my eyes have been waiting for a change for a long time. Well I've tried the previous version, gdi++, but it wasn't stable enough.</div>
