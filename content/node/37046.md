  a question.\r\n\r\nI am looking for an approximation of the very elegant sans serif
  font that is the basis for the Houston Astros logotype.  The font used is obviously
  NOT a script font like Fenway Park or Sarah Script but a nice sans serif font that
  has been connected to make a script font effect.  Very nice and I think it increases
  legibility.\r\n\r\nAny ideas what the original font that the handlettering is based
  on might have been?  I figure the uppercase A is custom drawn, but the other lowercase
  letters look very familiar....Hmm....\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/astros_5037.gif]"

  body: "Hi Jan,\r\n\r\nYep, it sure is.  But the first S looks very familiar and
    like a standard font from the memory bank.  The second s is nowhere near as elegant
    and looks a little rushed.\r\n "

  body: Drawn pretty badly I reckon. Couldn't they have found more elegant ways to
    connect the letters? Especially the "tr".

  body: "It's a mixture of script styles, with an s that is normally not connected
    and and r-style that usually is connected. 'Radio' that Stephen suggested uses
    the more conventional connected script 's'. This logo was probably designed to
    be script-like, but a bit more legible, as you suggested. I doubt if it based
    on any font, except in a vague 'generic' sort of way.\r\n\r\nIn my opnion it works
    from a distance, but doesn't look so good on close examination, like the 'Franken-font'
    it is.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
