  and Paul Herrera are teaching a Brush Roman Class at Typecon. This is to me a once
  in a lifetime chance to study with 2 masters of letters.\r\n\r\nWednesday, August

  Downer & Paul Herrera\r\n\r\nCost: $200 (Two Day Workshop)\r\nMaximum Participants:
  24\r\nLocation: Pacific Northwest College of Art\r\n\r\nThis is a two day workshop.
  Participants must be prepared to attend both days.\r\n\r\nThis course is being taught
  by two Iowans who have had vast experience in the lettering profession, especially
  with a brush. John Downer and Paul Herrera will provide instruction on the proportions
  of Imperial Roman Majuscules, and show how the letters are formed with a flat, one-stroke,
  lettering brush. Each participant will receive valuable pointers on paint control,
  proper technique, stroke sequences, and various essential aspects of brush manipulation.
  Regular demonstrations will also be given.\r\n\r\nNontoxic, water-soluble tempera
  paint will be used. Materials will be included in the cost of the workshop.\r\n\r\nHope
  to see you there!\r\n"

    video is not great, as I took it with my iPhone and I don't edit or modify films,
    nor do I know how. \r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n-Remy"
