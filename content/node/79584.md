  of then-editor E. Thomas Kelly, supplied SIGNS of the Times magazine's new Art and
  Design section with an alphabet a month, a project predicted to last only two years.
  Misjuding the popularity of the \"series,\" it instead ran for 27 years, ending
  finally two months before Becker's death in 1959, for a grand total of 320 alphabets,
  a nearly perfect, uninterrupted run. In late 1941, almost ten years after the first
  alphabet was published, 100 of those alphabets were compiled and published in bookform
  under the title, \"100 Alphabets,\" by Alf R. Becker.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ARB
  66_520_005_4747.png]\r\n\r\nAs published in June, 1937, this is the description
  that accompanied Becker's 66th alphabet, Neonline:\r\n\r\n\u201CNEONLINE BLOCK,
  alphabet No. 66 in Alf R. Becker\u2019s SIGNS of the Times series, is a very bold,
  modern style for feature display lettering. Care should be taken in the laying out
  of this alphabet, and every letter should be made as bold as possible...\u201D\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontry/arb-66-neon-block-jun-37-cas/|the
  link...]]\r\n<!--break-->\r\nWell that was a bit of an understatement! Fortunately,
  this font pak isn't understated. After the main Neon font was finished, a ton of
  work went into developing alternate character ranges, a second neon effect, a layering
  option accessible via the styles menu, and two supplemental fonts for the headlining
  and text chores. And did I mention the extensive kerning? The finished result is
  a handy little family that can tackle of wide variety of design needs.\r\n\r\nMany
  font designers have tackled the task of taking Becker's incredible achievement from
  paper to digital, and many claim to treat his work with care and dignity. But the
  Fontry's Becker fonts remain the most historically accurate and viable treatments
  available, arriving in two industry-satisfying versions: CAS (Computer-Aided Signmaking)
  and DTP (Desktop Publishing).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ARB 66_520_001_4154.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ARB
