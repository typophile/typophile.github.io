  it's already quite good, if I say so myself, there are a few things that don't seem
  <i>right</i> yet, but I can't pinpoint it. So first, I'd like to ask if anyone can
  find some points where it can be improved, and secondly, I'd like to ask how legible
  it is.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quita_v6_3810.png]"

  body: The curves of the i are a bit lumpy and could stand to be finessed some. As
    for legibility, it says "Quit", yes? Only the T took me a moment to recognize,
    probably because of the extra loop. You could end that stroke  wide open and the
    Q would not suffer.

  body: "Actually, it is meant to say \"Quita\". I know the 'a' is hard to see, but
    so far, this is the only way I've gotten it to work somewhat.\r\n\r\nI modified
    the 'i', and I exaggerated the curves of the 'a' a bit. I hope it's clearer now.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ambigram_v3_5387.png]"

  body: "Aha. I was wondering if it might have been intended as \"Quits\" or \"Quite\"...
    Never be afraid to borrow strength from a strong letter for a weak one. If you
    make a clearly unmistakable \"A\" in there, the reader's mind will say, \"That's
    a strange-looking Q, but it still can't be anything but a Q.\" See:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quita_sk_6026.png]"

    if you could introduce a ball or pear terminal to the tail of the Q it might help
    identifying the i.\r\nTim"

    of the beautiful curves. I hope I can get them back with further refinements.
    Too bad I'm leaving for Prague in a few hours, so I won't be able to work on this
    till I get back.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ambigram_v4_4516.png]"

  body: I'm back from Prague, and I've had some time to work on it. There are still
    a few things I'm not completely happy with, but I feel it is nearing completion.
    Most people seem to miss the 'A' the first time they read it, does anyone have
    suggestions on how to make it clearer? I've edited the first post to show it's
    current state.

    say if you'd prefer no reworkings of your file, I was having trouble describing
    this in words.\r\nPart of the reading problem, at least from my end, is that being
    an Anglo I try to make an English word from it.\r\nTim"
