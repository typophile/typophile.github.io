  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello! I&rsquo;ve been working on this logo for a bit. It&rsquo;s not really a big deal - I&rsquo;m doing it as a favor for my Aunt. It&rsquo;s for her church&rsquo;s youth group. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the image, but I feel like the image and the type are very disconnected - in a bad way. I would really appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m hoping you can see what I was going for, but in case you can&rsquo;t, I will explain. The dove is a well-known symbol of christianity, it is also supposed to serve as a hand holding a compass. If you&rsquo;re okay with a bit of a stretch, the inside of the compass kind of alludes to the Star of Bethlehem. But I realize that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily come across, and I&rsquo;m okay with that.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Stefanie</p>
<p>Perhaps the dove/hand/compass logo should be allowed to dominate the arrangement? Seems to me that the lettering is &lsquo;shouting too loud&rsquo; next to the image, rather than supporting it.</p>
<p>What would you say to trying &lsquo;compass ministries&rsquo; in smaller capitals, on two lines – above and below the image – centred and generously letterspaced? Maybe try a serif style to contrast against the forms of the logo? Good luck with it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some observations at a glance:</p>
<ol><li>The metaphor hand-as-a-dove has been profusely used; it's not necessarily a weakness, but I guess I've seen that precise image before (try these bad samples: [[http://www.alohapeaceproject.com/images/index/Logo.jpg|Aloha]], [[http://www.coalitionforkids.ca/images/coalition-for-kids-dove-logo.png|CFKI]] or [[http://scarletowls.urfcomics.com/images/AboutBITHTileLogo.gif|BITH]]).</li>
<li>The compass doesn't seem that to me; I see a quirky 16-hours-clock, instead; probably you should quit some elements (it is quite busy), and enlarge orthogonal  beams in the rose; better: you could try tilting the vertical ones.</li>
<li>Perhaps the disconnection you notice is in the font itself –I wonder who's its designer–, because it looks oddly geometric –and I appreciate Geometry a lot–, really ugly as sin (or that's what my displeased perception feels).</li></ol>
Nevertheless, I think your concept has potential. Just need more sensitive work.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The font itself is incredibly wonky and unbalanced. I see technical problems in nearly every letter. I suggest shopping for a better quality font.</p>
<p>I also agree with Marcelo about the symbol; it&rsquo;s painfully common to see a dove/hand used for a church. Why not make the compass itself into a logo? Perhaps with the arrow pointing to a cross?</p>
<p>For a youth group, I&rsquo;m picturing an edgy/rugged yet sharp style (think Swiss Army) that appeals more to teens. I&rsquo;d look at vintage compasses for inspiration, like [[http://thevintageaviator.co.nz/files/images/pilots-possessions/preview/pilots_possessions-004-rfc-wrist-compass.preview.jpg|this one]] from [[http://thevintageaviator.co.nz|The Vintage Aviator]].</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, now that I&rsquo;m looking at it on here, the compass is a bit busy. I&rsquo;ll work on that a bit more, make it more recognizable. And I realize that the dove/hand thing might be used a lot, but really, when it comes to churches, what isn&rsquo;t cliche? There&rsquo;s really not much that hasn&rsquo;t been beaten to death there. Even your compass w/ cross thing, I&rsquo;ve seen it many times. Alright, back to the drawing board. New typeface. Above and below. New image altogether. I will try it all. Thanks for your comments!</div>

<p>What isn&rsquo;t cliché? Heh. I used to work in the peace movement; seen more hands&rsquo;n&rsquo;doves than I could shake a (pacifist) stick at. But sometimes clichés are all we got.</p>
<p>Given that, I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest doing a new image altogether and I would be concerned if you threw the designer baby out with the bathwater; just get the type to play nicer with what&rsquo;s there already.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Stef,
Just not to be missunderstood: I didn&rsquo;t mean you should change the main image (actually, my words were &ldquo;it’s not necessarily a weakness&rdquo;); the only thing I pointed is that I –and only I– had the sense of having seen the same image somewhere (probably in a locale brand), what made me feel uncomfortable a bit, but –once again–, that&rsquo;s just my troubled perception/long-term-memory.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is mainly a typographic design site, and one must realize from the beginning that all individual characters one could create are already created (since the &lsquo;A&rsquo; to the &lsquo;€&rsquo;), which is to say, we work on signs that are arbitrary clichés by definition. I think the unique limit is given by self authenticiy, beyond which one falls in the deadly sin of <em>kitsch</em>.</p>
<p>Having said that, I beg you: throw away that hideous font, and you&rsquo;ll see how everything&rsquo;s gonna fit and work out.</p>
<p><strong>MarS</strong></p>
