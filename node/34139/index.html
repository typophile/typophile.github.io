  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi guys. It came to a point I had to design a logo for my own company. Just when I got to do it I found out I'd rather change the name of my company. I made it too complicated for me.

I'm a actually a developer but I also do design jobs (press/web/ux/ia). I used to do design as my second job but I ended up without any time of my own so I focused more on development lately.

About the logo. I made many designs so far but I couldn't get any "wow idea" so far. I tried all kinds of stuff (starting on paper) but ended up with some very clean and too simple logo that just has a font variation. I wanted something that makes you smile.

Logo should be half serious and reflect (if possible):
- software solutions on Microsoft products
- innovation
- quality
Logo should be applicable on different mediums of different quality.

Since it's sole proprietorship company it has a rather complicated full name (EN translation):
Inovares, innovative solutions Robert Koritnik s.p.

I would be really glad to get any input from you gurus.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inosp_6288.jpg]</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">I suggest that like a program or code you write you list for yourself all the goals you have in mind for the design. And your survey your competition so you see what you are competing against, what you need to be different from & maybe better than. When you have made your survey of what is around you you can decide on tone. I don't suggest half serious that's too wishy-washy. Pick a direction or emphasis - especially when you are small. 

BTW- Why 'something that makes you smile'? That is only one way to make people remember you. It might be the right way to do that - but keep in mind the larger goal it serves. Being remebered is usualy the #1 goal of a logo design. 

I suggest that even though what you made is nice - it isn't memorable. I would start again with a plan & work up to the solution in an intentional/deliberate way.

Feel free to post more stuff or talk about your thought process.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok. Thank you. Both of you. I really needed this.

First of all I wanted to "pump" from the following things and conceptions:
- innovation
- idea
- new
- change
- @ (these days related to internet/web/email)
- exclamation mark (as wow when there's an innovation)
- future
- development

Here are some scans of my paper drawings (some). None of them got realised so far because I didn't find them worth going deeper.

there are more ideas here.
- letter i in some 3D shape: cube/sphere
- stars/sparks as ideas
- egg with stars as "idea is born"
- i in shape of @

I also had a daisy (happy go lucky) in normal and digitised (squared) and flying dandelion seed (free/innovative ideas).

But none of them is like: "WOW this is clever."

I was thinking how to make this more "person" and more importantly even a computer person but still not too much so it will also resemble into an i as @...

I'll concentrate on typography later.

I was also playing with stars a bit. Here's the result. I was also thinking of capturing stars on a negative square (or something) to capture them somehow "on the sky".

Because of four stars of different size we get dimension and "non-corny" look of a single five-star that too much reminds on communist times... ;) if it was red, no one would think in any other way.

		<div class="commentbody">The last version seems strong to me. And any of these ideas might be a good direction but I suggest that you have to be more rigorous to pick the right one to focus on. You can just decide that you like one best or that it is the most memorable - but that is just 'shooting from the hip'. Who are you competitors? What do they do for logos?  Take a look at it against it's competition. 

This is beyond what is normally done for a small company but to take things to a really professional level you could do a careful experiment with strangers ( maybe pay them a small fee ) & see if your logo is more memorable than your competitors* by flashing the logos in a random order on a screen and then asking for the names. Or by showing the logos again with extras they didn't see & asking which ones they subject saw in the series. Time the response. There are many possibilities. 20 people or so may be enough to get a good sense. You can also ask what people feel or associate with your logo & the others - you may be surprised.

*you should mix in local logos from other categories of business as well and maybe some famous ones too.</div>

thank you. the last version was interesting, but I think I found a better place to put the star in.

Regarding competition I don't consider anyone that does the same things as competitor. More like a possible business partner. Because I'm primarily a contractor which means I'm normally not bidding on projects. At least 95% of the time I'm not. Most of the small companies don't really have a logo whatsoever. Some do. I'll make a research.

I'm definitely showing this to others too.

You're right. I will have to go one way. I just wanted to refine ideas into a better and more comparable result than just sketches. I will have to go with one of that I made.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">We're slowly getting there. :) This is the latest version in four different variants. The remaining text is missing and will be added afterwards. Star sizes are adjusted to the V letter of a certain typeface and have therefore different shapes and sizes.

I incorporates stars on V and added two additional one to:
1. balance the stars to the optical centre of the text
2. make the "sparkling" not just a star. Innovation is a sparkling idea.

<strong>Some questions for you:</strong>
1. What's your opinion about the logo solution?
2. Which typeface do you prefer if any of the shown?
3. Would you suggest another one to test? Which?

Anyone else's preference? I was leaning toward Avenir but don't like the italics, because they have no cursive letters... For the same reason I like Myriad, but I don't like the "va" part of it because it makes it too "poetic".
Insignia was chosen for it's very clean industrial shapes but lacks other versions...
Avantgarde is also very geometric as Insignia and has sets and all but I prefer insignias style better.</div>

The best possible font would be:

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry to say this, but the first thing it reminds me of: adidas.

Especially the geometric sans versions (too many round characters). Even though adidas is having three stripes (and way bigger) where you have three stars the shape drawn by these is triangular. They won't sue for this but resemblance is not what you're trying to achieve.

The custom font version is the way to go I guess. I really liked the spec you showed in the other thread.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks golfomat. The sans serif type is still in development and I also decided to give it a try. The letters seen here are first revision. Now I'm already on the fourth and it becomes slowly what I want it to be. Every day. I'm closer.

About the adidas comparison. I don't think there's a big percentage of people that would see it the way you did. So I guess I'll be going with the same idea.

I'll post the result when the type is ready enough to make the complete logo (didn't want it to turn this way but we learn every day).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If we stick to discussing this topic here we might get slightly dragged away into psychology and branding - another thread? "When is it resemblance and when is it you?"?!?

For the logotype: I think the "e" needs some work. I'd consider making the eye a little smaller. Or lower the spine of the "s". For me there's a slight imbalance with these characters. The "wobbliness" within the other characters has a lot of charme. Maybe counterspaces are to symmetric, which is irritating.

Changes:
<ul>
<li>font used is my own Inovares Medium
<li>stars have rounded inner corners to make them look non communist-times like
<li>stars' angles were not perfect the last time that's why I made a variation of letter "v" to make them more balanced and perfect shape with 36 degree angles
