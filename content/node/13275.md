    target=\"new\">before</a> (<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41877.html?1091554535\"
    target=\"new\">twice</a> even), and came to the conclusion that it must be custom
    designed, but it does look a bit like <a href=\"http://www.roostertypes.com/prod_display_single.asp?catalog_id=1300\"
    target=\"new\">RR Railroad Gothic</a> or <a href=\"http://www.roostertypes.com/prod_display.asp?group_id=BlockGothCond\"
    target=\"new\">RR Block Gothic</a>.\r\n\r\nIf you just need the logo in eps format,
    try <a href=\"http://web.brandsoftheworld.com/?id=112&query_id=4131853&page=1&brand_id=1785\"

  body: "The F.A.Q. may not be the obvious first place to look when someone is thinking
    about posting an I.D. request. Maybe there ought to be a separate page (listed
    at the top) called something like \"Most Requested Font IDs - Look Here First.\"\r\n\r\n(Now
    that I think of it, we don't really know when someone looks in the F.A.Q. and
    then doesn't post an I.D. request because they got their question answered...
    Maybe it's working fine most of the time.)"

    think it already is a vast improvement that it's sticky and highly visible at
    the top of the list. I will add a \"How to survive the Type Identification Board
