body: "Oops, I posted this on the solved ID board by accident.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering
  if anyone knows with a quick glance what typeface(s) they are using on http://www.weylandindustries.com/investor.
  Knowing you guys, I'm sure you do :)\r\n\r\nIt looks like they're using some Gotham-like
  type, some Helvetica and some other typeface all on the same page. But I can't seem
  to find an exact match for example to the big '95 89 93' numbers and some of the
  others.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n- someone who used to be on typophile all the
  time but hasn't been on here for quite some time.\r\n"

    us which specific part of the page you need to identify or even better provide
    an image attachment.\r\nPS: I see skyfein attached some images for you\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI

  body: Strange, I've used Proxima before, but some of the typefaces in this style
    look so similar. Thanks fvilanakis. :)
