body: "I was wondering if there are any searches for font appearance that use exclusion
  or allow you to select multiple characteristics\r\nlets say I want to find all fonts
  with open 4's and has 7's with a strike through and I don't care if they are san-serf
  or serf\r\nbut I also want to look for stencil fonts with double story E's.\r\n\r\nI
  would have to do separate searches. I'm kinda upset because instead of selecting
  for multiple characteristics I want in a font\r\nI'm selecting one and eliminating
  all others.\r\n\r\nAre there any better tools out there besides identifont?"
