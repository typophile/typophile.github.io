  June 16\r\n6-8:00pm\r\nType Directors Club\r\nhttp://tdc.org/tdc/archives/3652\r\n\r\nCommercial
  engraving for print has an illustrious history as a vital technique for graphic
  design and typography. Engraving is a fluid, free-hand expression restricted only
  by the perimeter of the surface upon which an engraving is worked. The exquisite
  beauty and gracefulness of arcs and shading inherent in the engraved line is unparalleled.
  For centuries prior to the digital age, engraving was the dominant methodology for
  teaching and innovation in lettering, and especially for calligraphy. \r\n\r\nNancy
  will explain why the organic nature of steel die and copper plate engraved imagery
  and text complements and enhances our visual experiences, and will demonstrate the
  importance of engraving as a modern graphic design technique. She will show examples
  from several avid collectors of elegant and unique engraved imagery, and share her
  expertise on engraving techniques and methodology. She will also describe the recent
  installation of a working engraving proofing press and the establishment of a new
  and growing engraving community in the great American city beneath the sea (New
  Orleans).\r\n\r\nNancy Sharon Collins is especially well-known for her exemplary
  bespoke hand-engraved social stationery. Besides being a stationer, she is a veteran
  graphic designer, typographer, independent print history scholar, partner in Collins,
  LLC, director of special projects for the AIGA New Orleans chapter, and instructor
  of design at Southeastern Louisiana University. Her book about American commercial
  engraving is due out in the autumn of 2012.\r\n\r\nImage: \xA9 Richard D. Sheaff,
