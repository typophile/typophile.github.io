body: "Hi there,\r\nThis is a fake italicized version of Knockout. A real italic version
  doesn't exist. Could someone out there recommend an alternative (which comes in
  an italic variant) so that I'm not forced to publish such an atrocity?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/knockout_italic_5005.jpg]"
