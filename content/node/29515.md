body: is there any way to get [[fontographer]] 4.1 installed properly on a windows
  xp pro sp2 os.  i keep geting an error message that the program cannot be initialized
  - not enough memory.  the machine has 1 gig of memory more than twice that of my
  98 machine.  there was no problem installing it on that.

    was also running XP, and Fog4 worked fine on that one (although it would cause
    the fan to go hyper for some reason). Adam Twardoch kindly pointed me here:\r\nhttp://fontlab.com/FontLab-Product-Support/FontLab-FAQs/FAQ-Fontographer/
    _\r\nBut the first one didn't work for me, and the other two were too drastic
    to bother with (I'd rather just buy FogLamp to access my old files).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'I have a compaq presario V2000, AMD sempron notebook with XP. I only had
    512mb of ram with shared video memory and Fontographer 4.1 ran fine. I just added
    a 1G memory stick so I now show 1.12G of ram and Fontographer still runs fine.
    Maybe, if you install and run F4.1 with 512 and then add memory, it will still
    work. Perhaps, someone else can try. '
