I don’t work for MyFonts but in my opinion this is something they cannot deal with: even if you can pre-register your font (which I don’t think is even possible), this is not going to protect you against someone else using “your” name. MyFonts is a commercial website, not a government office.

If you want to protect the name, you must go to the EU Trademark Office. According to http://oami.europa.eu/ows/rw/pages/CTM/feesPayment/feesPayment.en.do, the fee to be paid is 900 euros if you file online. It is valid for ten years, and then you must renew it (1350 euros). It must be a very good name indeed.</div>

Thanks for the info. I'll check out the link.

I find 900 euros to be a lot of money for just a name (but then again, it's only 90 euros a year)... I don't know if it's that good ;-) I think I'll keep my fingers crossed and hope no-one else thinks of it too. Glad I didn't mention it here! (Though I trust every one of you!)</div>

Unfortunately your economics professor was giving some bad advice there. I've read that there are several problems with that method, including that it's easy to fake (just steam open an old envelope, change the contents, and then reseal it).

The copyright office says "The practice of sending a copy of your own work to yourself is sometimes called a “poor man’s copyright.” There is no provision in the copyright law regarding any such type of protection, and it is not a substitute for registration."</div>

I did ask MyFonts.com this very same question directly. They kindly replied:

"It is quite rare to register trademarks for font names. As I understand it, the main benefit of registering a font name is that you get triple damages in the event of a violation. For small foundries and independent designers the cost of registering a trademark is unlikely to be cost effective.
All that is generally necessary is to ask us to mark your font name with a TM to signal the fact that you consider it to be your trademark. This is sufficient to establish priority in the use of the name for commercial sale of the font."

So, no cost and no guarantees. Not that I'm cheapskate (although Dutch) but there are not a lot a guarantees in life anyway. And *if* someone does copy the name, I'll consider that flattering.</div>

I suppose it depends on how seriously you want to protect your intellectual property. I trademark all my font names and formally register the copyright on all of my font software. A TM has no real legal standing.</div>
