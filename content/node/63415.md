body: "Hello everyone! I'm an Australian, first year visual communications student
  who, amongst other things, is studying typography. Unfortunately, while everything
  else seems fairly straight-forwards, typography is completely alien to me!\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  to the present. I'm currently working on my first typeface, for a university assignment.
  The brief states that we're to 'design and name a new and original DISPLAY font
  / typeface... [which] can be produced in either lowercase or uppercase (or both)
  and should also include the design of punctuation and numerals.' The emphasis is
  on hand generating sketches and process, and typographic detailing.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration
  I'm drawing upon is the art of the First Nations people (native to Canada). Some
  good examples can be found in [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/blackbird_hollow/sets/72157618011825873/|this
  flickr set]].\r\n\r\nI was hoping to get some advice on developing and refining
  my typeface. Below are some images of my current sketchings (apologies for the high
  resolution, but they should be clearer this way). Clearly these aren't refined;
  I'm trying to establish a set of letterforms I like before going on to detail them.
  Many of these are simply experiments.\r\n\r\nThanks. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typo

  body: Some of the shapes seem to be on the right track, while others not so much.
    I really enjoy how it reminds me of stacked stones and pebbles. What you need
    to do is decide what you really want it to do. Some of your shapes are not as
    finessed as the others. I'd get rid of those. For instance, the 4th P. Why do
    you need a huge counter? And the 4th B. It just looks squooshed. It is fun to
    have alternates. I'm not saying get rid of the alternates. While all of the D
    look like fish, the 1st seems to be the least successful. And do you want this
    to have some Japanese flavor? Some of the shapes are more successful at this too.

  body: "Really interesting. I love the unusual way the forms are broken with the
    stripes.\r\n\r\nI think you should look at the overall harmony. For example, most
    letters have vertical and/or horizontal breaks, whilst a few have slanted ones.
    To me the first way is stronger. There's also a bit of reconciling to do with
    the curved terminals vs square ones, and you'll find some kind of 'rule' proably
    a good idea, though it doesn't need to be set in stone. Think about the weight
    of each glyph too, the thickness of the strokes and amount of counterspace associated
    with each form, since in the 'First Nation' example, the R looks quite a different
    weight to the S. Widths too need to gel more, I think."

  body: "This looks like a really interesting project.  If I could pick some nits
    about terminology, which I hope will help you if this assignment has a written
    component:\r\n\r\n\"First Nations\" is a blanket term that refers to most of the
    aboriginal peoples of Canada; the group of people covered by this term is very
    culturally diverse, which means (among other things) that there is no single First
    Nations art style.  Your work seems to be inspired specifically by the Northwest
    Coast art style, which extends from the Alaska Panhandle (and areas immediately
    to the east) through much of coastal British Columbia, including most of Vancouver
    Island.  The Coast Salish art style shows many influences from the Northwest Coast
    style as well.\r\n\r\nI don't know a whole lot about this art style, but reading
    up on it might help you refine your work.  A book which I haven't read but which
    looks particularly promising is <em>Northwest Coast Indian Art: An Analysis of
    Form</em> by Bill Holm, published by the University of Washington Press.\r\n\r\nAnyhow,
    best of luck with your project."

    my sketches more. I attempted to create an entire alphabet using the blockish
    style seen in the letters A, B, D, P and R in the first set, but I'm afraid it
    just doesn't work with a lot of glyphs.\r\n\r\nIn order to get more consistency,
    I've simplified a lot of the shapes and applied a new set of rules. I think these
    can be called an improvement, but there are certainly issues. The ones I immediately
    pick up on are the counter of the 'B' being to far to the right, legibility issues
    with the 'D' and the leg of the 'K' looking somewhat out of place.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typo

    as a blanket term - I wasn't sure how familiar everyone would be with the terminology
    (I'm certainly not). I'm specifically looking at the Haida culture, which I've
    done some research in to, but not a great deal. I'll probably look in to it a
    bit more later, but for now my entire life is taken up by either typography or
    work.\r\n\r\nOh well, off to do more sketching."

    like a tree in ''First Nation'' the F was more original there too. When you use
    ''whole'' that is unsliced outlines they sort of look flimsy, as does the Y. One
    side of the X could be thicker, the bottom of the L can be much thicker and one
    of the strokes of the H could be thicker than the others and so on. The Z gives
    an uneasy feeling as if it will topple over. I feel that your most successful
    letters are the O, B and R. The A is great and reminded me of the Kelly gang''s

  body: "Highly interesting. I am not too keen on display fonts usually but this one
    has quite some potential. \r\n\r\nThere are quite a few weights problems though.
    O and Q are much darker than anything else. B is too dark compared with the rest
    of the line. Try for example to use the top element of the R as the top element
    of the B (but adapt it).\r\n\r\nThere are problems of homogeneity. In terms of
    width, for example. I disappears, J is too large (and darker than L): I mean it
    is larger than the U. In terms of style, this is not homogeneous yet too: by making
    W diagonal on one side only, you have actually given it a very diagonal feel,
    if that makes sense. P and R are too close too. I J L U seem to belong to a different
    font.\r\n\r\nThere are issues regarding readibility/legibility: H is difficult
    to read because the inner gap is too large (or you need to space the glyphs differently).
    W will create a gaping hole in the line. It is too close to the M in terms of
    shape too.\r\n\r\nR is not wide enough if compared with 'similar' letters : B
    and P. \r\n\r\nWhy don't you have a look at successful decorative fonts to see
    how they solve these problems. Say, have a look at Bifur - it is far enough from
    your font: you won't be tempted to copy. \r\n\r\nKeep up the good work!"

  body: "Ah! I commented on an old version. Here are updated comments (I am not repeating
    what is still valid).\r\n1 general comment: as pointed above by miss tiffany,
    you need to be careful with the cuts through the letters as they may disappear
    in a smaller setting. You may have Stencil installed on your computer. Try printing
    it small, see what issues you have and from what size, then check what the size
    of the cut is and adapt your own font accordingly. \r\n\r\nThe B looks far far
    better! So does the R.\r\n\r\nCheck a few random fonts for PBR - preferably non-geometrical
    and by a good designer (check who won the Prix Charles Peignot, open their fonts).
    Often the upper loop of the P is closer in size to the lower loop of the B than
    to the upper loop of the B. Is this a solution you want to use? Similarly, the
    upper loop of the P is almost always bigger than the upper loop of the R. \r\n\r\nYou
    may struggle adjusting the weights of O and Q. Check Anisette in its extra bold
    version for inspiration. You may want to get them a bit narrower and increase
    the counter, or add another horizontal split or widen the existing one, but let's
    face it, it will be tough to retain their current elegant shapes. Also, check
    that you have made enough optical corrections and that they don't look like they
    are dancing above the baseline. I have difficulties asking you to change those
    glyphs which are my absolute favourites! \r\n\r\nEF: open a few random non-geometrical
    fonts from great designers. Check EF - what do you notice? Is the bar of the F
    often as high perched as that of the E? In your font, there is too much space
    at the bottom of the F. This creates a gap at the bottom. Check B v. E too, and
    see what you notice: isn't the bar of the E a bit lower usually, in order not
    to create the darkness that can be seen in your font? \r\n\r\nAnother few things
    can help you:\r\n\r\n- think thoroughly 'what do I want to do?' again (you need
    to do that a number of times when you do a font, so don't worry if you have done
    it already); think 'what are the characteristics of this font' and think 'visual
    characteristics' as opposed to 'intellectual purpose' - some questions that may
    pop up in your mind are : 'why did I create a vertical cut out in the H, whereas
    it is vertical or diagonal in most/all others' - 'why is the J so low and wide?',
    'what interested me in the \"First Nations\" designs?' but think 'what interested
    me visually', as opposed to 'what interested me intellectually'? \r\n\r\n- decide
    which are your favourite glyphs and why, then see what you can do to get all the
    other glyphs to be as good!\r\n\r\n- use O and H (once improved) to benchmark
    other glyphs, this way:\r\nHHAHHOOAOO HHBHHOOBOO etc. and see what looks wrong
    to you in terms of how dark and how wide the characters are. I say O and H because
    I would often consider them to be the lead characters in something I create and
    because one is round and one is vertical, but feel free to choose others. It is
    more difficult to benchmark with more than one glyph/character BUT better (with
    only two characters, you may end up getting all your glyphs too similar in terms
    of width). Thus you can try IIAIIOOAOONNANNEEAEE. Once you are more confident,
    you need only compare with one I instead of two etc. Thus IAIOAONANEAE etc. IBIOBONBNEBE.\r\n\r\n-
    some characters are impossible to read: GSY spring to mind. X looks like two different
    characters.\r\n- the new T is far better.\r\n- C & G are too close in design.
    \r\n\r\nLast but not least: I am very happy if someone tells me my ways of working
    / thinking about fonts make no sense, so feel free to criticise what I am saying.
    On top of that, it will provide Flay with different points of views among which
    he can choose! \r\n\r\nKeep up the good work. The improvement between first and
    last version are really impressive.\r\n\r\nD."

    a story this would be super excellent. i.e. the sun rising or setting in O and
