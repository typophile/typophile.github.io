  to be in love with historic manuscripts and old books taught us NEVER EVER to use
  blackletter in all capitals. He should have known better.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/_DSC3213_5720.jpg]\r\nThere
  is a country in the world where blackletter still lives on and takes an active part
  in the sometimes chaotic vernacular graphic design. Mexico. It is a must to cut
  out your name in blackletter from a shiny  metallic adhesive and stick it to your
  lorry window. There everything goes. Living amidst of it for several years I started
  to take notes and photos. Watching and comparing painted signs of many signmakers
  (rotulistas) and tried to work out the sweet middle point of it all and make a blackletter
  that could fit on any wall and may look okay in capitals or even in small caps.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Oro-y-Plata_465x636_5103.png]\r\nThe
  \ collection Oro y Plata (Gold and Silver) is a Mexican style blackletter, dedicated
  to the three big silver cities \u2013 Taxco, Zacatecas and Guanajuato. Taxco is
  more angular compared to rounded Zacatecas and elaborate Guanajuato. The fonts contain
  small capitals, ligatures, initial forms, contextual alternates and other OpenType
  features. The special feature is a stylistic set of superscript caps with possibility
  to underline them. It supports all the European languages using Latin alphabet.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lamatas/oro-y-plata/"
