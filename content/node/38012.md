body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm redesigning my personal webpage which consists mainly of a blog
  on energy policy issues. I'm an academic by day so the content is fairly serious
  but I try to keep it readable and `fun' (as fun as energy policy can be).  The redesign
  is also part of a wider project to design a standard look for all my professional
  stationary (letterhead, reports, and so on). \r\n\r\nFor the body text of these
  documents, I've decided on Adobe's Chaparral Pro. It's got a nice reliable look
  to it but it's not as serious as more traditional academic publishing fonts (e.g.
  Palatino). However for the web page I'm a bit stuck. \r\n\r\nObviously Chaparral
  isn't a commonly installed [[http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html|browser-safe
  font]] and I can think of a reason for using almost any of the three alternatives:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A
  serif: serious, academic, reliable, all that good stuff</li>\r\n<li>A sans: well-set
  it can look trustworthy and perhaps it's good to be a bit more relaxed on the web</li>\r\n<li>A
  monospace: Lucida Console or Courier echoes the shape of Chaparral to some extent,
  but probably inappropriate for longer posts.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
