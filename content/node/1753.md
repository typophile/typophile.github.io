    advantage to changing the weight in illustrator rather than using the change weight
    tools available in Fontlab?  <BR> <BR>Besides which, you&#39;d have to reimport

    and that Im pretty new to this Fontlab thing theres no advantages I guess. Where
    do I find the change weight command and any specific problems that I should pay

    could keep anyone busy for a very long while. Experiment on glyphs to see what
    happens when you change weight evenly, or more on the X or Y axis. <BR> <BR>Check
    and uncheck the option to see what happens when you &#34;keep glyph dimensions&#34;.
    This is the key difference &#40;to me&#41; between the Illustrator method and

  body: Peter, I work on my fonts in Illustrator then paste them into Fontographer
    and have found this to be a very satisfactory way of working, especially as I
    can scan in my pencil sketches to use as an initial guide. That said I am very
    familiar with Illustrator and feel its tools give me more control.   <BR> <BR>I
    tried increasing my font weights in Fontographer but found the angle of diagonals
    would change and this is something I want to avoid. I have also found that working
    on the heaviest weight first then using it as a guide for the lighter weights
    has been quicker than doing it the other way round.  <BR> <BR>I must say that
    I agree with the comments James made about manual work helping to understanding
    the design rather relying on automated devices.

  body: 'Peter, <BR> <BR>I also like to draw glyphs in illustrator. Mainly because
    I can put all the glyphs on one page plus multiple weights for easy comparison.
    Typically though, I manually add weight to the font, point by point. For troublesome
    letters, print them and get out your pencil. I would not add weight in illustrator
    using offset paths. Here&#39;s why: <BR>1. Usually doing so adds all kinds of
    extra and useless points, particularly in curves... so you have to go in and fix
    them. <BR>2. It adds weight uniformally ie .25pt to both sides of all curves.
    This isn&#39;t good because: <BR>- a. you typically add more weight to the verticals.
    <BR>- b. this creates problems in your joins. <i>Notice in Frutiger&#39;s drawing
    how little weight is added in the area where the stem and branch join.</i> <BR>-
    c. when adding weight, your baseline stays the same but your overshoots increase
    a tad.<i>Again see the drawing.</i> <BR> <BR>By the time you get rid of extraneous
    points and fix all the problems you&#39;ve spent more time than if you&#39;d just
    added the weight manually. <BR> <BR>About the only place this makes sense if when
    doing a monoline font. Even then you cannot simply draw the wireframe and make
    light = 1pt stroke, regular 4pt stroke, bold 7pt etc. The light weights will look
    ok. But they get ugly quickly as you add weight, because you need to do optical
    thinning and some thinning in the joins, plus baseline maintenence. Consider <a
    href="http://www.on-idle.com/foundry/foundry_monoline/monoline_regular.html">Foundry
    Monoline</a> which does those three things so subtly and masterfully, you almost
    cant tell they did them. But you sure as heck would have if they didn&#39;t! Foundry
    Monoline used in a <a href="http://www.promecon.dk/designguide/files/visitkort.pdf">PDF.</a>
    <BR> <BR>You can make a display font in 10 minutes with a brush and scanner. There
    is no free lunch if you want to make something that will pass in a text setting.
    It is long, and it is tedious. And in my opinion, fun. We are talking weeks, months
    and years. Not days, minutes, and seconds. <BR> <BR>FontLab has better tools &#40;as
    other&#39;s described&#41;, but even then they still need tweeking. Do it manually
    first so you know the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. <BR> <BR>Good Luck! <BR>Randy'

  body: The Interpolate tool in FontLab is the most efficient way I have found to
    make bold outlines from the regular weight. This tool interpolates the position
    of both on and off curve points &#40;or nodes and control handles in PS outlines&#41;
    relative to touched points. By making two passes at a glyph, one for x-direction
    movements and one for y-direction movements, it is possible to increase or decrease
    weight while maintaining curve characteristics. Typically, the only thing that
    requires adjustment is transitions between stems, e.g. the crotch of the n as
    in Randy&#39;s example.

  body: Thanks John. <BR> <BR>That sounds like a winner! I have only fiddled with
    FontLab. Would you mind taking us through that process step by step, more like
    a tutorial? Or, if you know of a tutorial, would you mind linking to it? I&#39;ve
    looked throught the FontLab manual, but I think it would be usefull to show a
    hands-on example &#40;maybe using the <b>n</b> glyph from my sample?&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>While this seems easy and convenient, Peter, I still recommend you try it
    by hand at least a few times. That way you would know when the <i>crotch of the
    n, needs adjusting</i> after transformation in FontLab. <BR> <BR>

  body: '<b>FontLab Interpolation Tutorial</b> <BR> <BR>Most discussions of methods
    to make bold letters use sans serif letters as an example. Since one of the great
    virtues of FontLab interpolation is that it preserves curve quality and character,
    I decided to use a serif example that includes curved stems and very irregular
    forms: Adobe Jenson Pro. <BR> <BR>The first thing to do is to put the original
    outline in the mask layer &#40;default Ctrl&#43;M on Windows&#41;. During interpolation,
    FontLab will display both the result of everything you do and the original state,
    but having the initial glyph shape in the mask allows you to maintain a visual
    reference through multiple interpolation passes. <BR> <BR>The interpolation tool
    works with both PS and TT outlines. In PS outline mode, you can only touch on-curve
    nodes with the tool, but the position of off-curve control handles will be interpolated
    relative to touched nodes. In TT outline mode, you can touch both on- and off-curve
    points. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/19233.gif"
    alt="Interpolate 1"> <BR>1. Here is the lowercase <i>n</i> from Adobe Jenson Pro
    Regular. The red arrow pointing to the toolbar above indicates the Interpolate
    tool. Click on this to activate the tool, or use the hotkey &#40;default Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;P
    on Windows&#41;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/19234.gif"
    alt="Interpolate 2"> <BR>2. When the tool is active, you can click and drag any
    point. I recommend adjusting a glyph in two passes: one x-direction and one y-direction.
    You can hold down Shift while dragging to constrain direction. The FontLab measurement
    bar will tell you how many units you are dragging and, if not constrained, at
    what angle. When you release a touched point, FontLab will display a preview of
    the result of the interpolation as a grey line. Note that when you move only one
    point, the grey preview shows the entire glyph shifted: this is because every
    untouched point has been moved relative to the first touched point. In the illustration,
    you can see how I have laterally moved five points to make the stems bolder. The
    grey outline shows the result of these movements. You should try to touch the
    minimum number of points necessary to achieve your aims, this allows FontLab to
    interpolate all the others and to preserve curve character even when curves are
    stretched or compressed. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/19235.gif"
    alt="Intepolate 2a"> <BR>3. As well as clicking and dragging points, you can specify
    relative or fixed positions for points by opening the Set Link Destination dialogue
    &#40;default Ctrl&#43;Click on a point on Windows&#41;. I use this most of the
    time. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/19236.gif"
    alt="Interpolate 3"> <BR>4. The result of the first, x-direction pass. <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/19237.gif" alt="Interpolate
    4"> <BR>5. In the second pass, make y-direction adjustments. In a Latin typeface,
    the y-direction adjustments may not be as regularised as the x-direction. For
    example, to increase the vertical stem weights as shown above, each touched point
    was moved 20 units. In the y-direction, I try to make optical compensations as
    I go. For example, the top of the main curve is shifted up 7 units, but the point
    in the crotch is raised only 3 unit, because I want the connection to the stem
    to remain relatively light. I&#39;ve also used this pass to not only increase
    the weight of the top serif, but also to drop its tip slightly so that the diagonal
    is closer to that of the original outline. Note the dots with circular patterns
    around them, <i>e.g.</i> halfway up the left stem, these are points that have
    been touched but not moved. It is possible to fix a point in this way, and because
    it has been touched other points between it and the next touched point will be
    interpolated. This is very useful, but you need to be very careful not to touch
    any point that you want to be interpolated; if you do, you will have to cancel
    the interpolate session and start again. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/19238.gif"
    alt="Interpolate 5"> <BR>6. The result of the second, y-direction pass. At this
    point I would check the width and, if it needs adjustment, use the interpolate
    tool again to shift the stems further apart. I would also make any other adjustments
    that I have not attempted during interpolation, such as shortening the inner serifs
    slightly. That top serif also needs attention. <BR> <BR>Note that you can touch
    a point as many times as you want within a single interpolate session, so if you
    are not happy with where you move it, you can move it again. All relative positioning
    is relative to the initial position.'

  body: Yes, extrapolation is pretty good &#40;you can thank Adam Twardoch for that
    feature&#41;. You build an MM font, and then enter values beyond the extremes
    of the axis. I generally find that one can&#39;t go too far beyond the extreme
    before things start getting pretty weird -- glyphs turning inside out, curves
    wrapping, etc. -- but extrapolation is very useful for getting a head start on
    a light and heavy weight from a regular and a bold.

  body: I&#39;m interested to hear about anyone&#39;s experience writing bolding <BR>algorithms.
    It seems like there are some pretty specific things <BR>that I do over an over
    again when I am changing the weight of a <BR>font manually. It&#39;s almost like
    I am applying an algorithm, I&#39;m <BR>just doing it by hand.  I&#39;ve been
    thinking about an algorithm <BR>based on the relative widths of a character. I
    envision pulling a <BR>slider to make the thicks thicker, and another to make
    the thins <BR>thinner. Or you could do the opposite, evening out the relative
    <BR>widths. It would be easy to manipulate weight as well as optical <BR>sizes.
    I could even see parameters that would affect how the <BR>character carried the
    wieght, say 80% inside, 20% outside for the <BR>x transformations, and 100% inside
    and 0% outside for the y <BR>transformations. <BR> <BR>What if I could draw a
    medium weight character, then push the <BR>thicks wider and keep the thins. The
    transformations would be <BR>pretty accurate for almost every character. Of course
    there would <BR>still be manual tweaking to do, but not nearly as much. Then for
    a <BR>lighter weight I could shrink the thicks and keep the thins, <BR>evening
    out the weight of the strokes. While controls over x and y <BR>parameters in current
    bolding algorithms are helpful, they really <BR>mess up S&#39;s, g&#39;s, M&#39;s,
    Z&#39;s etc. As has been pointed out, they are <BR>also insensitive to the joins.
    By focusing on the comparison of <BR>thicks to thins, instead of x to y, most
    of these problems could <BR>be solved. <BR> <BR>As far as how to do this, I have
    envisioned a user-defined <BR>skeleton <a href="http://betatype.com/h1.gif" target="_blank">[image,
    5k]</a>, representing various strokes. The line width at any <BR>given point would
    be measured by looking at where the arc tangent <BR>runs into the outline of the
    character. Some consideration would <BR>have to be given to how to handle intersections,
    but I think this <BR>could be solved by looking at the other tangents on a stroke,
    and <BR>continuing the trend. It could be visualized as a histogram of <BR>thick
    to thin measurements. One could then adjust the relative <BR>lengths of the tangents
    based on a variety of parameters. The <BR>original curve would be altered &#40;pushed
    out or in&#41; based on the <BR>tangent lines.  Incidentally, this could be applied
    to serifs as <BR>well &#40;they could be defined by the user as part of the skeleton&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>It may be possible &#40;though difficult&#41; for the algorithm to <BR>determine
    the appropriate skeleton strokes from the outlines, <BR>which would make the operation
    easier on the user, but I imagine <BR>that users would get better results defining
    the skleton <BR>themselves. <BR> <BR>Does anyone else have any ideas on weight
    algorithms?

    <BR>On the other hand, a stroke approach can never really work, because type is

  body: 'Hi Christian, <BR> <BR>One drawback is that this is seems pretty specific
    to your way of developing typefaces &#40;skeleton first&#41;. I know you mention
    getting the skeleton from the outline in the last paragraph, I just don&#39;t
    know if it can be done. When you work from skeleton-&#62;outline there is major
    tweaking &#40;I assume, particularly as you get more bold.&#41; I&#39;m curious
    what some of the Python Scriptators think. <BR> <BR>To clarify, when you say based
    on thick and thin, not x and y, you mean that it takes into account the angle
    of contrast? &#40;that might be a slight improvement on x &amp; y controls&#41;.
    But I think you&#39;re adding more complexity with the skeleton thing. As I read
    your post, the skeleton concept fired the memory bringing up this image from LucasFonts.
    It&#39;s buried in the information section under Corpid. Don&#39;t know how useful
    it is. '

  body: The only reason for the skeleton is to define the angle at which the stroke
    width is to be measured. As I was trying to think of how to measure thickness
    at any given point, I came up with a drawing that looked a lot like the &#39;e&#39;
    to the left. I just needed a mathmatical way to draw the lines based on the outline.
    It occurred to me that my measurement lines were all arc tangents of the average/center
    line. I couldn&#39;t think of a good way to determine the center line from which
    I should measure the tangents, particularly where two lines intersect. One solution
    was a user defined measurement line, separate from the ouline, which naturally
    &#40;though not necessarily&#41; would be the average of the outlining stroke.
    <BR> <BR>However, the circles provide the same answer as the skeleton &#40;thanks
    Randy&#41;. The appropriate angle of measurement can be determined by the points
    at which the diameter of the circle intersects the outline. I still need a way
    to translate it into appropriate movement of bezier nodes. &#40;Idea&#39;s anyone?&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>To Hrant&#39;s point, a stroke based system can never really work, as
    letterforms have evolved much further than simple lines &#40;though their shapes
    are abstracty based on strokes&#41;. Apart from the bolding algorithm, I can see
    some usefulness in a skeleton, much like 3d animators use. The muscles and flesh
    react to a skeleton, changing shapes according to parameters, but maintaining
    their integrity and form. So to Randy&#39;s point, the skeleton would not be the
    basis for the design, the outlines would; the skeleton would be added after as
    the basis for transformations.

    new thread</a>--before this was resurrected by Paul--that you can 'go East or
    go West'. That's what Frutiger does in his example that you posted--go East. But
    in his FontLab interpolation tutorial, John does both. \r\n\r\nIs there any argument
    for just going one x-direction, as Frutiger? Or is this just a matter of the typeface? "
