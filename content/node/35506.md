  Shop. They are pretty small and just getting started.\r\n\r\nI've looked through
  a few fonts and have some ideas on where I want to go, but I want to hear what you
  guys (and gals) have to say.\r\n\r\nThe only feedback I got from them so far is
  that they like Script fonts because of the way they flow. :)\r\n\r\nSo any feedback/suggestions/ideas
  would be awesome - just curious to see what everyone else has for ideas.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMike"

  body: I've never seen a flowing machine shop. The last time I was in Japan I was
    handed a business card from a machine tool company with the main line set in Park
    Avenue. I prefer to use script with a contrasting industrial looking font.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4654.jpg]

    "Adv".

    mechanical/technology look - and trying to get something more country and warmer
    looking... As I said the company is small (1 person doing all the work mostly)
    and it's in a small down.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts/ideas on that?\r\n\r\nPS. chm, right

  body: Most of the machinists I know use a pantograph machine to scribe on the metal
    (when they have to). A favorite font is indeed a script. If you think about scripts
    that can be fairly easily used with a pantograph, you'll be in the ballpark for
    that audience

  body: I like the idea of mixing the script with stencil, but that stencil is 100%
    "US Military" so I'd look at some alternative stencil ideas...perhaps going for
    a sans serif stencil face.

    industrial looking font. Might be a little too MTV for your target audience though.
