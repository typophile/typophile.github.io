  body: ' Nice! <BR> <BR>The most pressing suggestion I would make is to flip the
    uc &#34;A&#34; horizontally. The conventional stress for an &#34;A&#34; is with
    the thin stroke on the left, and the thick stroke on the right. <BR> <BR>I would
    also reverse the stress of the uc &#34;N&#34;, making the vertical stems thin
    and the diagonal thick. &#40;That may help the uc &#34;M&#34; look more natural
    in this setting, too.&#41; <BR> <BR>David '
