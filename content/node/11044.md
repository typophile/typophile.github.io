  body: Ouch, that&#39;s a tough one. It might well be some  <BR>obscure internet-only
    freeware font. Chesh, where  <BR>are you when you&#39;re needed?

  body: That&#39;s not actually distressed, is it? It looks like something that was
    in color that was scanned as b&amp;w, then the levels were messed with to increase
    the contrast. The variations in the letters seem to indicate this. Can the original
    poster verify? <BR> <BR>Sorry I can&#39;t provide an id quickly. Plus, I&#39;ve
    been away for a couple of days because I wasn&#39;t getting my Typophile emails
    for some reason. &#40;I seriously need to shake the obscure-free-font reputation
    I&#39;ve gotten around here, though.&#41; And now I&#39;m going out of town, so
    I can&#39;t do more. Go take a spin around <a href="http://www.acidfonts.com">Acid
    Fonts</a> and see what&#39;s there. <BR> <BR>See all you Bay Area typophiles &#40;plus
    Stephen&#41; on Saturday!

  body: Yes, Cheshire, thats exactly what I did. <BR> <BR>&#34;It looks like something
    that was in color that was scanned as b&amp;w, then the levels were messed with
    to increase the contrast.&#34; <BR> <BR>Got the font thou! Its called ModTR. Found
    it at fonts.com powered by AGFA Monotype. <BR> <BR>Thanks everyone for imput on
    this font. I thought it was from one of those &#39;free&#39; sites too. <BR> <BR>Jill
