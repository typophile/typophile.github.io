body: "[sigh]\r\n\r\nI need to come up with a name for a type blog to be hosted at
  work (Adobe). So it will be work-related. My idea is to post musings on the technical,
  business, historical and design aspects of type/fonts and type technologies, with
  particular attention to OpenType and a bit to SING as well. It won't be 100% Adobe-centric
  - I will certainly call attention to cool things from other foundries and companies.\r\n\r\nBut
  what to call it?\r\n\r\nI have long thought that if I ever got a vanity license
  plate, it would read \"FONT MAN\" - but I'm not sure that's a great name for the
  blog. Another option suggested by David Lemon (whose license plate reads \"TYPE
  NRD\" btw, if you didn't know), was \"Thomas on Type.\"\r\n\r\nI am eager to hear
  any other suggestions. If I end up using your suggestion, I will buy you any one
  Adobe font family or application of your choice. (Note that delivery of the prize
  may be slow, as there is an internal ordering process I have to go through. But
  I'm good for it.)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    it does not include the both obvious and ubiquitous \"type\" label that I think
    is not necessary in the blog title - your readers will associate it anyway. \"Phints\"
    also includes a subtle notion of \"mints\", which would be small (11pt? ;-]) intensive
    and distinctive candies \u2013 not the worst thing to have in mind when thinking
    about entries of your blog.\r\nAlternatively, if you don't trust the readers'
    media literacy and want to stress the word \"type\" like other posts have implicitly
    suggested, you could append \"-ty\" or \"-type\" (would then be: Phinty/Phintype),
    but you'd lose some of the \"fonts\" and \"hints\" associations.\r\nPerhaps a
    short subtitle like \"Thoughts on type(, Adobe) and more by Thomas Phinney\" would
    clarify your blog's goal and its contents."

    but since the product is discontinued it's probably politically incorrect now.
    Also would be easily confused with the application if anybody ever Googled to
    find the blog.\r\n\r\n- We Love Miranda, which is very true, but probably not
    suitable for this particular blog. (Miranda is my daughter's name.)\r\n\r\n- PostScript
    or post-script, which are very good, but in the context of Adobe will make people
    think of something else.\r\n\r\n- PhinneyUncensored.otf, which has great appeal
    personally, but probably has some wrong connotations for this purpose. \r\n\r\n-

    is a sans serif\" Phinney is Adobe's Program Manager for Fonts & Core Technologies.
    Typblography, the Phinney-us Blogg contains his musings on the technical, business,
    historical and design aspects of type/fonts and their technologies, including
    OpenType and SING.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThis just shows how indecisive I can
    be when confronted with many good choices. So we have three winners: Hrant Papazian
    (Phinney-us Blogg), Will \"superkhy\" (my other car is a sans serif) and Jason
    Dewinetz (typblography). I wasn't planning on three first prizes, but in a spirit
    of justice and generosity, that's what we're doing.\r\n\r\nRegrets to Paul Dwyer
    who also came up with some other riffs on \"typblography,\" but Jason did it first,
    and his was the version I went with (keeping the \"P\" in there).\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    two of the three winners are based in Canada. I swear I didn't look at where they
    were from until I was notifying them to get them their prizes.  :)\r\n\r\nNote
    also that I have sent email to all three prize winners. If you're one of the winners,
    and didn't get it, check your spam filters or just write me directly.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n"
