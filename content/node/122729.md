  body: The unidentified sample comes from the [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/19639679/Typodarium-2015|Typodarium
    2015]] edition (complete sample [[http://m1.behance.net/rendition/modules/132572169/hd/c99179206fe7aa92bcf98706329e8e32.jpg|here]]).
    I was not able to find the list of typefaces used for each day so your best chance
    may probably be asking  directly [[http://2016.typodarium.de|Slanted/Typodarium]].
