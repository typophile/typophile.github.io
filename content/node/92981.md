  body: "When drawing a new font, there is a time when the final form is found \u2013
    almost \u2013 but the curves are not slick and clean yet, that's what I call the
    \xBBraw\xAB form. Raw \u2013 no sweeteners added! In this family I tried to redefine
    this moment in type development for the eternally beautiful \xBBFranklin Gothic\xAB.
    I call the design \xBBFranklin Gothic Raw\xAB, not to be confounded with \xBBrough\xAB.
    The family can be used like any good normal typeface, you hardly see any difference
    to a conventionally cut \xBBFranklin Gothic\xAB in small sizes. The charm of the
    design becomes obvious the bigger it becomes, then it enhances your design with
    its imperfections in the outline. \xBBFranklin Gothic Raw\xAB is therefore an
    extremely versatile family. I created the cuts that I considered necessary for
    the seasoned designer who knows what he's doing. Enjoy!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FGR01_5587.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FGR02_5425.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FGR03_4467.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/FGR04_4409.jpg]"

  body: "Today I would like to introduce my newest typeface, it is called \xBBFiorentina\xAB.
    The name implies flowery as well as Florence. I designed it after buying one of
    those incredible Florentine wrapping papers at my favourite paper-shop in Munich.
    \ \r\n\r\nThe font turned out to be an ecstatic, abundant, embellished script
    in the Renaissance tradition. It could have been made for the Medicis or Sforzas.
    I designed it completely new. \r\n\r\nI gave it many different swashes and understrokes,
    alternate upper- and lowercase characters, 659 glyphs in all! The font has all
    letters and accents for for basic English, the Central European languages, Baltic,
    Roumanian and Turkish.  \r\n\r\nFiorentina is one of the most beautiful typefaces
    I ever designed. Your designer of beautiful typefaces Gert Wiescher\r\n \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Amore_6032.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Benvenuti
