  should see. (Look at the end where Mark posts his plans for his fonts and where
  Karsten has posted his little manual.) \r\nI wonder if we all put our collective
  heads together, we could develop the primary needs for an Opentype guide/manual
  which type designers could post with their fonts. There are a great many Opentype
  bells and whistles which go unused just for lack of knowledge. \r\nI am hoping this
  will end up as a document aimed at graphic designers and typographers who use type
  in more sophisticated ways than the typical word processor folks but not so geeky
  that people get lost or turned off by it.\r\n\r\nThe floor is open . . .\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I'll never joke again.\r\n\r\nThe Adobe OT Guide should be regarded as the
    standard document for OT users (and I refer to it too). Moreover, OT fonts should
    stick to the basic features and their functionality. So users can develop a feeling
    of familiarity with OpenType in general. Using terminology consistently would
    help too, think of \"Std\" or \"Pro\", as would more standardized OT-feature interfaces.\r\n\r\nMy
    sole point in the other thread was Stylistic Set features which may differ in
    every font. Btw, it is an advantage that this is so.\r\n\r\nAs to the \"starter
    question\" however, you are right. I think that *if* a font differs from the (quasi)standard,
    this should be mentioned, so users know what they will get.\r\nLike, are proportional
    osf & currency symbols the default ones? Prebuilt fractions only or arbitrary
    fractions? What does calt do? Even, what does the character set look like? Pro
    can mean quite different things from foundry to foundry - even if the term is
    applied correctly.\r\nThis is not an encouragement to divert from (quasi)standards,
    but to make known if this is the case."

  body: "\"The Adobe OpenType readme seems to cover most of this\"\r\nThe Adobe readme
    is good but not what I was talking about and not intended as a replacement. Also,
    users don't read it.  You have to bundle it with fonts to have a prayer. Also,
    it is Adobe's.  Would other foundries want to send you to Adobe's type site or
    bundle Adobe literature with their own fonts? I doubt it.\r\nThe premiss for my
    question is: Why do so few people seem to know about the features of the fonts
    that they purchase? What would help in that area? Would this not help add to the
    feeling of VALUE in typefaces that go the extra mile? \r\nI am thinking about
    something that would be modified for every new typeface that would be BUNDLED
    with the typeface and explain its individual features.  It would be Chinese menu
    style with assortments of mix and match text blocks that type designers and foundries
    could customize on a case by case basis.\r\nLook at Karsten's \"manual\".  It
    is a start.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Here's my \"dream tool\". Think of it from the point of view of end-user
    usability, as interactive, not a static pdf.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the best gizmo
    to check out the features of an OT font is the OpenType Preview panel in FontLab.\r\n\r\nDown
    the left are the buttons for the features (although the names could be spelled
    out in full).\r\nThere are two large fields where you can enter text.\r\nThe top
    one (\"source\") shows the font plain, the bottom one (\"result\") shows it with
    the OT feature activated by selecting a button at left.\r\n\r\nThis gizmo could
    be \"loaded\" for a particular font, so that the default text string for each
    feature shows the glyphs (or some of them) where the feature is present.\r\n\r\nIt's
    awkward to put your new OT font through its paces in InDesign, because the OT
    menu is buried, and because some InD commands, such as small caps, don't tell
    you whether the feature is true OT or not, (At least, that's how it is on CS 1
    -- I have just licensed some fonts to an outfit running Quark 3.5 on Mac OS 9.1,
    which suggests to me that a stand-alone OT previewer that comes with the font
    would be preferable to relying on graphics applications for demonstrating font
    features.)\r\n\r\nI've suggested to several font distributors that this would
    be a good tool to have online. I wish I had the know-how and resources to implement
    something like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    showed as many axes as a font had, with sliders to select instances from what
    was actually available. That convention of letting the utility flex to fit the
    design's feature set would be cool.\r\n\r\nKnowing that OT font features may vary
    from one design to another, maybe this tool could accomodate some starter text
    that the type designer specifies, which will show the features individually and
    in combination. If the design has a lot of swash, or ligatures, or specific goodies,
    that could be part of the starter text. I have a few features planned for an upcoming
    release which, when used together, multiply the options. I'd like to illustrate
    those combinable features from the start as well. How to display this elegantly?
    I agree the separate feature buttons are good, and the before/after split screen
    is a must. Maybe the tool's default is to start up with all the compatible features
    on, and the user can switch them off at their discretion.\r\n\r\nI have to say,
    I think it would be so very nice if this tool was open-source or made freely available
