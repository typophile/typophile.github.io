  body: "Once I located the entire logo, it became apparent that if this was based
    on an actual typeface, it's been so heavily modified it makes identification nearly
    impossible.\r\n\r\nThen I found logos with subheads, and there is a good chance
    that the main logo was derived from the typeface used for the subheads--I just
    haven't had any luck identifying a sans serif with a pointed terminal on the e
    and a backwards slanting terminal on the r.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be recognizable
    to someone else on the board....\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mantra_Esplanade_Updated_RGB_4402.JPG][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mantra_HRA_Updated_4C_RGB_3609.jpg]"

  body: Thanks, DPape. I'm willing to bet that mantra is a heavily modified version
    of Forever Two.

  body: I just spent a few minutes copying and blowing up the m, a, n, t, and r from
    the subhead/tagline and superimposing them over "mantra;" the stroke widths and
    overall shape match up well, though details have been significantly modified.
    I believe the logo is custom, built on a base of TF Forever.
