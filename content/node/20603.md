    is pretty similar. It has stems, and a full t crossbar, but otherwise the letterforms
    are the most similar I've found.\r\n\r\nStill looking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    the closest I found. Someone else can look in other places -- I'm done on this
    one, unless I trip over the font somewhere.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
