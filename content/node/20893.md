body: "I'm not sure what to make of the Caslons I've seen so far. Carol Twombly's
  Caslon Pro (Adobe) looks good and is versatile, but it doesn't really sing on the
  page like Augereau would (as Garamonds go), or perhaps FF Scala or Eureka, if we're
  talking slab serifs. \r\n\r\nPerhaps my inexperience has gotten the better of me
  and I can't appreciate Caslon for what it is. I don't mind spending money on something
  nice, lord knows I've already spent a small fortune on fonts, but I like beautiful
  things that are made by dedicated designers. I'm looking for a Caslon that is thick,
  robust, has a full set of ligatures and obviously, osf/sc faces.\r\n\r\n"

    I assume, then, you're looking for a sturdy but exciting serif with roots in the
    1700s? What do you think of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=MVB.118650.0.0">MVB
    Verdigris</a>?

    one of these days. Looks like a Sabon, basically. I was asking about Caslon specifically,
    though. And it does seem that I need to appreciate the fact that it is indeed
    a "humble workhorse."

  body: 'William, not sure if my work schedule will allow that. But as I become more
    interested in type and type-related design, I might involve myself in events like
    that. Being a spectator (and user) suits me just fine, but I''m playing with the
    idea of designing some day, although I have no formal training in the craft. Perhaps
    my eye for the aesthetic might serve me well in that regard. The last thng I want,
    however, is to insult the craft by being a dilletante among masters who have had
    actual training. The master-apprentice relationship might be dying, but I''d like
    to think it still thrives in some areas. Hopefully it still does in the realm
    of typeface design. '

  body: "Palatine, TypeCon is definitely not only for master type designers. Most
    people there are graphic designers who love type, not type designers. And most
    events will be of great interest to graphic designers, judging by last year.  \r\n\r\nAs
    to the master-apprentice question, if I remember rightly, I heard Matthew Carter
    say that all type designers have been largely self-taught, from the 15th century
    till now. This may be changing with the programs at Reading and KABK, though my
    impression is that these are a way for people to develop themselves who have already
    educated themselves quite a bit in type design, or the related subjects they are
    studying.   \r\n\r\nIn any case I would highly recommend TypeCon to you, given
    what you say is the state of your interest.You will meet and be able to talk with
    some of the best designers in the world there, and start to see if it is for you
    or not. I was delighted to find last year how accessible and helpful people were.
    Also the workshops will help you to start on the technical side, if you want. "

    Adobe's is the most complete and useful set. I'll have a look at Founder's Caslon,
    to be sure, but I'll try a few more experiments with setting Twombly's Caslon.
    I don't think I've made full use of the set.\r\n\r\nI think I've become so accustomed
    (and unfairly partial to) thick, meaty fonts that are somehow reminiscent of metal,
    that it's coloured my views of other, equally useful faces that might not otherwise
    have the kind of sparkle and flourishes I've come to expect. \r\n\r\nSo, my apologies
    to Carol Twombly et al! This young apprentice is off to learn all he can about
    Caslon, and particularly why he should be using Adobe's version, if nothing else.

    superscript and subscript to build alternate fractions (I need the eighths and
    thirds too!). I'm also a stickler for ligatures. I also don't tend to use small
    caps unless they are native to the font (i.e. not from the Quark menu) but with
    the various types of heads I need for cookbooks they can be very useful. I've
    used Adobe Caslon (and Garamond) for a lot of cookbooks. Thesis fonts and some
    of the Fontfont like Meta have good fraction sets too.\r\n\r\nThe swashes and

    from correspondence to a simple memo. Even legal reports are given a bit of typographic
    loving. I've talked a few of my law profs into accepting work that is typeset

    case \"c\" in Rotis, if Im not mistaken. The captial \"Q\" however, is a nice
    touch - a classic Caslonesque style. But I still prefer the beautiful capital
    \"Q\" in Twombly's version. I have an edition of Don Quixote that is set in \"Adobe
