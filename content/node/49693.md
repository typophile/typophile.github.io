body: "hi, everyone,\r\n\r\nmy name is natasha, i'm a senior at the school of the
  art institute of chicago studying drawing along with \"art & technology\"... which
  really doesn't have anything to do with type design but i really love doing this!
  i'm still learning a lot about it, and have made some things in the past that are
  pretty whack but this is going nicely, i think. i'd like some feedback on my latest
  font, \"Dechenko,\" which is a kind of deco-futurist font i've been working on.\r\n\r\nsome
  questions i have about it in particular:\r\n\r\n+ i've been having a lot of trouble
  with capital S. none of the ones i draw seem to fit. have you seen similiar fonts
  like this that i can use as inspiration for my s?\r\n\r\n+ the numbers are varying
  widths. i thought this might make uses where there are a combination of numbers
  look more dynamic. is this ugly? \r\n\r\nbut feel free to say whatever you want.
  i've been lurking on this forum for about a year now so i know you guys are really
  critical and that's exactly what i need!\r\n\r\n(also, if you could tell me what
  the best way to go about this is, should i have posted a PDF? i see that others
  in the past have.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dechenko1_5262.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dechenko2_5407.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dechenko-alpha_5888.jpg]"

  body: "I love the symbols. I think your S is quite nice; the fact that it is not
    fully as big and wide as the other caps is not as much of a problem as you imagine.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the numerals, for practical use there should probably be more choices. Make
    a wide set in the LFs and a narrow set in the OSFs (an open-topped rectilinear
    4 in the narrow set would be cool), and then users could mix and match them at
    their own discretion."

  body: "I like it as it is, even though about the figures I think 3 should be the
    same width as 5; also would be best to \"spice\" the alphabet with some additional
    alternates to choose from. Regarding the capital S, looks OK to me. Though I would
    love seeing an alternate Q with more distinctive tail. \r\n\r\nPosting a PDF is
    not a requirement, but sometimes it helps to see the design up close, in more
    detail. But some people prefer rounding off the design first..."

  body: "The capital S looks fine to me too.  What would an esh shape look like for
    the lowercase?  You could maintain a straight vertical line with a right facing
    top hook and a left facing bottom hook.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea
