  featured at <a href=\"http://ntmy.org\">NTMY</a> yesterday.\r\n\r\nOne would expect
  a little more creativity from a graphic designer. Javascript effects are very easy
  to do these days. You can still find my comments, in Portuguese, in the code."

    for me. Cause i don't have strong knowledge in html or java or anything else.
