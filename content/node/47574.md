  body: "Hi Petra,\r\n\r\nwhere do these fonts come from?\r\nYou cannot find them
    because their names have been changed. Those names are pseudonyms. For example,
    Camille actually is Avant Garde Gothic, Bertram is Copperplate Gothic. Hell, someone
    even has bothered to rename Comic Sans: It\u2019s \u2018Childish\u2019!\r\n\r\nClaire
    is actually <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/type_o_tones/memimas_regular/\">MeMimas</a>
    by Type-\xD8-Tones."

    names as I have seen the same description for them on several different websites...
    strange. I guess they are trying to make it difficult for a competitor like myself
    to copy their style.\r\n\r\nhttp://petrifiedinpink.blogspot.com/"

    the Typophile Type ID Board? ;-))\r\n\r\nHowever, in some (probably most) cases,
    this practice is not okay. Modifications like renaming are often prohibited by
    the foundry\u2019s EULA."

  body: Word of advice -- avoid these wannabes and get the originals. Using pirated
    type is bad for your karma. For every letter you set in those rip-offs somewhere
    in the world a cute cuddly kitten dies.

  body: "Yves, to clarify:\r\nAs far as I understand the issue, Petra has found this
    dubious PDF on the website of an American company, Stacy Claire Boyd.\r\nShe didn\u2019t
    make it, and has stated that she\u2019s looking for a place to buy the fonts.\r\nI
    reckon these fonts are not \u2018rip-offs\u2019, but rather renamed originals.
    This of course might be a violation of the EULA(s), but it\u2019s not (necessarily)
    pirated type. Either way, Petra\u2019s not the pirate. \r\n\r\n<cite>For every
    letter you set in those rip-offs somewhere in the world a cute cuddly kitten dies.</cite>\r\n\r\nOMG!
    Does this mean that by using \u2018Childish\u2019 aka Comic Sans, a kitten dies
    AND <a href=\"http://www.bancomicsans.com/pdf/bunnypunch.pdf\">a bunny gets punched</a>?\r\n\r\n"

    I\u2019m with you. But doesn\u2019t it make a difference whether someone actually
    sells (or distributes) those renamed fonts, or just shows them in his/her greeting
    cards repertoire? I find the latter overanxious, shortsighted and wrong. Still,
    it shouldn\u2019t be lumped together with the things SSI etc. do."
