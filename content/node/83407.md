body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nOver the past few years I have set many documents in Minion
  Pro. Typically they're only about 3,000 words long and have no graphics, but when
  printed as a PDF out of Microsoft Word (I tried LyX but my citation format does
  not play well at all) the PDF file is a whopping 62mb! Trying to send a document
  of this size to a printer over our organisation's (unfortunately) browser-based
  print server is a nightmare. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how to reduce the file size
  of PDF documents set in Minion Pro? Is there some export setting I have overlooked
  in Microsoft Word?\r\n\r\nI am running Mac OS10.6.8 with Word 2011.\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks."

  body: "This is due to how Word create PDF files. It will rasterize rather than embed
    \"no embedding\" fonts and non-TrueType fonts. It was never ment for this kind
    of work anyway. If you have the budget for a graphic designer, I\u2019d be happy
    to typeset the document for you. Feel free to contact me! Other options: try Cute
    PDF Writer or MakePDF."

    often use that method if I need a quick PDF and don't want to bother launching
    Acrobat, but one disadvantage is there's no way to control the quality of the
    PDF's graphics when you make it that way. However that may not be a problem for
    you since you mentioned your PDFs are usually just text."

  body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI tried giving 'Print to Adobe PDF' a go and my file size
    is now down to under 1mb... thankfully! I think the reason I gave up on 'Print
    to Adobe PDF' in the past was because it kept crashing, but now that problem seems
    to have been resolved."

  body: Minion Pro has editable embedding. The Adobe website says so, and I confirmed
    it with my installed Minion fonts using the Microsoft font property extension.
    I just PDF'd a Word document (on Windows) with over 10,000 words and no graphics
    using the "Convert to Adobe PDF" plugin in Word and it came out 14 KB. If I printed
    the Word document to a .ps file and distilled that, it came out 46 KB. This is
    not a Word problem (unless there's something in the Word document that hasn't
    been mentioned -- for instance, is track changes turned on, or do you have versions?).
    More likely, Distiller is set up wrong.
