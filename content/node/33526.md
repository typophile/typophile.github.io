  range U+2013 through U+FB02.\r\nWho uses that stuff?\r\nWhat advantages are there
  for an indie foundry to include those characters in a font?"

  body: "Not much that I can think of. Those are IBM linedraw characters that are
    included for compatibility/support of some pretty ancient linedraw graphics. We
    don't include them in our fonts at Adobe, and I don't recall ever hearing a complaint
    or request on it.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, they're easy to make, and you'd just
    have to make them once and you could recycle them in your later fonts.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    will include Unicode 261E = fist, and perhaps 262E, peace symbol, and maybe even
    the delightful 2615, \"Hot beverage = tea or coffee, depending on locale.\" \r\n"
