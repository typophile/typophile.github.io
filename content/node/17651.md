  they don't really say much about printing? Well, that may all soon change if I get
  my way with this one. So far, the client has let me include whatever I want. So
  far they are grouped into cards by category. Color printing, measurements, paper
  sample, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd of course there is a typography card. I have quite a few
  ideas already, but if you could have any information about digial color printing
  (as is pertains to type) for reference at your fingerprints what would it be? Some
  I have, for example, are 1) pixelated vs. vector type 2) outlining type 3) type
  sizes, etc. These could be anything applicable. File setup, how things print, color,
  etc.\r\n\r\nWhat's on your wishlist?\r\n\r\nShu"

    after some sleep.\r\n\r\nYou have a good start Shu. I was about to say I would
    like to see the differences from direct to plate vs conventional stripping, but
    you mentioned it is all digital. The paper quality and characteristics and how
    they affect the type at different sizes are probably the most important and interesting.
    Hopefully you will get a nice selection and variety to work with.\r\n\r\nRob"
