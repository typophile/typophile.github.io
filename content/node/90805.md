  movie intro logotype]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/universal_6500.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  find it pretty juicy. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut now to type.\r\n\r\nThe main line looks like
  a Gill Sans / Akzidenz mixture, while the subhead is Futura. It does not look like
  a deliberate combination choice.\r\n\r\nThe spacing of the main line is nothing
  but a complete mess.\r\n\r\nThe S in UNIVERSAL is too small.\r\n\r\nThe gap between
  100th and Anni\u2026 is extraorbital.\r\n\r\n\u2013 A splendid animation, great
  music, high ambitions. Only type was neglectable. \r\nI wonder."

    it a few seconds shorter.\r\n\r\nThis video shows all of Universals' logos over
    the years. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E98iTbFqRuM&feature=player_embedded\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/universal_6362.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy
    favorites are still the early ones."

    Art Deco feeling of the early ones is still captivating."

    favourite of this genre in recent years was the opening sequence of <em>Charlie\u2019s
    Angels</em>, in which the camera flies through the logo and into the opening action
    sequence in the clouds behind Columbia."
