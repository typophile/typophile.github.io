body: Alpha Midnight ID requests have popped up several times on this board. As we
  all probably know by now it hasn't been digitized, so I'm in the process of making
  my own.  I've been able to find almost every letter (caps only) in some form or
  another but have had no luck finding samples of either the "Q" or "Z".  Is anyone
  aware of a comprehensive collection or scan of this font, be it on line or in a
  book?  Thanks in advance.

    though, and times being what they are it's out of my budget.  Do you have the
    book yourself?  If so, would you be willing to do a hi-res scan and either post
    it or email it?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
