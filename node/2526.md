body: 'I recently had a problem with my G4, it took 4 hours with tech support to determine
  it was a hardware problem. So into a shop the computer went. The outcome? The motherboard
  is fine but it turns out its a power problem. I had the computer connected to a
  power strip with a surge suppressor but &#40;I&#39;m guessing&#41; because of everything
  else attached to the strip it caused fluxuations to the power. Once I plugged the
  computer directly into a surge suppressor and directly into the power socket - problem
  - gone. Dan '
