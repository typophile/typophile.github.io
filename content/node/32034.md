  body: "If you've just read that other thread mentioned in gulliver's post above;
    one font not mentioned there which seems to really be an actual slab-serifed version
    of Futura, is Linotype Memphis.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/1224/memphis-family.html\r\n"

  body: Memphis and Futura look totally fab together. Mostly because Memphis is  Futura
    with slab serifs tacked on.
