  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">First off, let me introduce myself since this is my first post.
My name is Mike, I am a graphic design student. I am from the new england area and enjoy playing the banjo, long walks on the beach and murde...i mean, scrabble. :)

I've always been more creatively inclined but after a misguided youth I found myself at 30 years old going back to school to begin to acquire some skills needed to enter the graphic design/advertising business.

Anyway... 

I'm trying to help a friend out and make him a logo for his construction company. 
I've decided (along with his input) that the best option would be to forgo using clipart tools to make letters form his name ;) and stick with just his name with maybe a small graphic.

Im having trouble finding a perfect typeface. I'm looking for something strong and clean. Something to suggest durability and precision. Something bold and unique. I thought that using something other than the stock fonts on my computer I would look into maybe licensing something or at least getting something that isnt as common as some of the more popular options.

Hoping for suggestions...

Thanks in advance,
Mike</div>

I say, figure out the symbol first (stylistically they need to relate). And think about something the type should communicate other than meaningless market phrases (except for durability and precision).

Logos that rely on letterforms alone are usually modified or custom drawn letters: for uniqueness, better handling of white space, collisions ... the list goes on. Just picking a font is rarely enough to create something "durable" and "unique".</div>

I thought that some custom drawn would be best. My drawing style is probably the furthest thing from clean and precise though. I suppose I could start with graph paper, a ruler, circle templates and some french curves. Then scan my drawing and convert the letters to vector shapes.

I am somwhat against using a symbol at all although my friend (client) seems to think it is important. I'm going to be including "construction" or "home improvment" in the logo so an outline of a roof, or a hammer or saw blade is not necessary imo. I told him that clever logos & graphics are cool if they work but you dont want people remembering "that cool logo with the circular saw blade for the "O", you want them remembering the name of your company. 

I've got a few vector drawings of symbols i might use but I feel like im forcing them into the design. I was hoping that the right font would either be sufficient or suggest the proper companion graphic. 

I really like that Gotham-Bold. In most fonts i tried, I had problems with the G which it the first letter of his name "Gannon" so I wanted it to be strong. Most of them were too "narrow and curvy" (pardon my lack of correct terminology, im working on it)
Thanks

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, have you ever visited myfonts.com ? You can use their search box to search fonts by descriptive keywords ("strong" or "construction" or whatever), and when viewing a font you can use the "sample text" box to see how a word or phrase looks in that font. And if you find something you like you can buy and download it there. You might find it useful.

> I am somwhat against using a symbol at all 

Mike, speaking as a designer myself, you're way too early in the project to draw that conclusion. You need to go through the design process of gathering info on the client, analyzing their marketing goals,  researching what similar companies (especially the competition) use for logos, and coming up with a whole bunch of creative concepts, both for symbol logos and also for type logos. Then narrow it down to a few concepts you like best, fine-tune them, and show them to your client for his feedback.

Maybe the final solution will be all type. Maybe it won't. You're not going to know until later in the process after you've seriously explored a wide range of ideas.

Come up with some concepts and post them here for feedback. They don't need to be perfect drawings; just good enough to communicate your ideas.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks for the input.

one of the things i have to learn is to put any preconceived notions about how it should be aside. I have a habit of thinking of a logo idea first and then trying to fit it in but resizing, adjusting, changing color. I think its good advice to start with a blank sheet of paper and a pencil and just brainstorm, writing or sketching anything at all that comes to mind. Then narrowing it down from there. 
 
ive come up with a few ideas. i might post them in the crit forum.

thanks again.

When I start a new project I often have a few ideas immediately that, at the moment, seem perfect. But a few days (or weeks) later, after working through the design process, I often find that the best solution is something different.</div>

You may wish to perform a keyword font search at Myfonts, e.g. this one
http://new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Ageometric/fonts/?sort=score

Look for “bold” or “clean” the same way. There might be something! </div>
