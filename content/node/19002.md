  body: Nice of you to say that, Yves, but every time you incredible guys ID a text
    face I know exactly where I stand on the skill ladder. My little niche here concerns
    the stuff that's fallen by the wayside - often for good reason (but I do like
    this little gem. I just wish it had been made with one case free of the rails
    and posts).

    expertise, and I suppose we all occasionaly get blown away whenever something
    gets identified that is <em>not</em> in our own personal niche.
