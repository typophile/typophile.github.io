  body: "Indeed, type design is everywhere these days. The piece about Matthew in
    the New Yorker is quite good for a general readership, but there are some introductory
    passages about type and type design which made me think, \"Close, but not quite.\"
    All of which is secondary to the fact that it is wonderful to see our beloved
    Matthew profiled by the great New Yorker. It couldn't happen to a better man.\r\n\r\nAnd
    it was also nice to see the Esquire piece about Jonathan and Tobias. Although
    I chuckled a little when I read that, \"Frere-Jones's crisply tailored Esquire
    Text, the magazine's primary text font (until recently, used nowhere else), helps
    define Esquire's look.\"\r\n\r\nI chuckled because the page of text in which these
    lines appears is set in (slightly customised) Apex Sans with headlines in Christian
    Schwartz's custom \"Stag\" typeface. The second page of the article, \"Evolutions
    of a Font\" also features \"Esquire Text\" aka \"Mercury\"."

    s-h-i-t in Scrabble?! Oh, and as if having to make a lowercase is secondary to
    some supposedly missing peculiars. But, yes, still great to see the coverage.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
