  true-to-the-original version of Metrolite (No. 2 Comdensed) with that classic lowercase
  a, or at least one with the alternate a.  I have this old type specimen that has
  both a's represented.  The 2 story one is actually on there under Metrolight, rather
  than Metrolite.  Was there an old knock-off? I always dismissed it as a typo, as
  the sheet was what seems to be a personal reference for a Linotype (that metal stuff)
  printer.\r\n\r\nI think I've asked this before, but the search function is revealing
  nil for me right now.\r\nAny help appreciated.\r\n\r\n-David\r\n"

  body: According to McGrew's <em>American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century</em>,
    pp. 216-7, the original version had two-storey a/g but in No.2 were replaced by
    one-storey a/g, with previous ones available as extras. <em>[edit]</em> Linotype's
    normal version follows No.2 but there's <a href="http://www.linotype.com/de/135960/metrooffice-schriftfamilie.html"
    target="_blank">Metro Office</a> which has the two-storey forms.

  body: "Thanks for the information.  It seems like there's a sacrifice taken with
    both options--Metro Office has no light weight, and the M's don't have the towering
    angles.  Both fonts don't have the Futura-like t's either.  \r\n\r\nAfter a few
    minutes of deliberation, maybe I should bypass digital altogether and kick it
    old school.  \r\n\r\nAny photo typesetters out there?"

  body: "<cite> > true-to-the-original version of Metrolite (No. 2 Comdensed) with
    that classic lowercase a, </cite>\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the \"No. 2 Condensed\"
    is doing in your statement. There was never a Condensed style in the original
    Metro series. And No. 2 is not the \"original.\"\r\n\r\nAs Karsten points out.
    The two-story a and g were substituted by single-story versions for the release
    of \"No. 2\" in order to make it more directly competitive with the newly popular
    geometric sans serifs coming from Europe at the time (Futura, et al.).\r\n\r\nIn
    addition to replacing the a and g, the A G J M N V W v w comma semicolon and apostrophe
    were all replaced with more \"Futura-like\" versions as well. There were also
    Kabel-esque versions of W and e available as special orders.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, however,
    there was never a Futura-like t.\r\n\r\nIf you're going to kick it old school,
    then don't go photo -- find someone with a Linotype and a font of Metrolite matrices
    and get the truly \"true-to-the-original.\"\r\n\r\n"

  body: "re: kentlew:\r\nWhat I was getting at with 'original' No. 2 was the first
    version of No. 2.\r\n\r\nLooking at this more carefully I'm realizing that my
    reasoning has been a bit flawed.  I'm going off of this old sheet of Linotype-printed
    fonts which may be falsely named (Metrolight & Metrolite being listed--where No.
    2 has the 2-story a).  On top of that I'm looking at samples of old 45s that use
    a Futura-like font that I've somehow concluded to be Metrolite solely due to the
    2-story 'a'.  However, said labels have that Futura-like lowercase t.\r\n\r\nUltimately,
    I'm trying to find the font used on these labels.  It's used with high enough
    frequency to make me believe it is something major and likely obvious, but I haven't
    ever encountered it in the digital domain, and I don't have any old type books
    or sheets that have it.  The closest thing I have to it is Metrolite.\r\n\r\nI'm
    also trying to print labels like this the exact way they were printed 40 years
    ago, and I bet you're right in that it was metal rather than film.  Here's a specimen:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/not-metrolite_3734.jpg]\r\n\r\nExcuse
    my reasoning and lack of knowledge.  I'm still trying to piece together how things
    were done before my time, how it all came to be, and so on."

  body: "Thanks to both of you for your help.  I went on a long internet tangent last
    night and ran into Tempo, but only found bold samples (someone posted a headline
    with it on this forum).  I'm assuming there was a light, medium, and regular version
    of this in the hot metal days?\r\n\r\nThis has me extremely interested in American
    Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century by Mac McGrew.  How do you both rate
    it?  I'm of the idea that this book would be in both of your libraries.\r\n\r\nMark,
    Metallophile looks great, it is distorted just right, whereas Tempo Medium is
    a bit too much for my taste.  It will likely become a purchase in the near future,
    but right now all I can think of is a Ludlow press and a 4 year apprenticeship
    program.\r\n"
