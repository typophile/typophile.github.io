  that are used on the West Coast Choppers iron cross logo.  I believe that the one
  used for &#39;Choppers&#39; is a variation of IRONWORK, but I&#39;m not for certain.  Here&#39;s
  a link to the logo: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.marzdistribution.com/images/WCC_LOGO.jpg"

  you happen to know the names &amp;/or where I can obtain the fonts, I&#39;d be very
  happy.  Thanks &amp; have a beautiful day. <BR> <BR>Kevo'

  body: Dave, <BR> <BR>Nice work - you&#39;ve saved me a ton of searching.  I guess
    I&#39;ll be buying my first font - and it&#39;s crap!  I guess it&#39;s just like
    the Kinks say... you gotta give the people what they want. <BR> <BR>Thanks so
    much. <BR> <BR>Kevo
