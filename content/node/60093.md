  body: "I'm using Pages '09 v 4.0.2(751).\r\n\r\nI can't seem to find a button, but
    you can do a really annoying work around.\r\n\r\n1. Highlight the letter\r\n2.
    Increase the size (this will automatically increase the leading too, but we'll
    get to that\r\n3. In the Inspector, click on the T (text inspector)\r\n4. In the
    Text portion of the inspector, click the Text button.\r\n5. Under \"Spacing\"
    one of the options will be \"Line.\" Under the field where you type in line spacing
    you should see the word \"Single\" with two tiny grey arrows to it's right. Click
    on the word \"Single\" and a drop down will appear.\r\n6. Select \"Exactly.\"\r\n7.
    Highlight ALL the text, not just the drop cap\r\n8. Type in an exact point size
    for your leading.\r\n9. Highlight your working drop cap\r\n10. In the menu under
    Format>Font>Baseline you'll see \"Lower\" as an option. Sadly, I don't know a
    keyboard shortcut for this so you'll hace to do a lot of clicking and dragging.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\n"
