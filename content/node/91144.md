  body: "If you want a free font, look for one that is similar, or maybe even better
    than that for what you want to do, that is legitimately free. :)\r\n\r\nHere's
    an example of a somewhat similar free font, <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/neuton.font\">Neuton
    Cursive</a>:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://21326.info/work/neuton/itals/golf.png\"
    />\r\n\r\nIt's not the closest, but there are also other free fonts which you
    can find that will work. <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/\">Dafont</a> has categories
    which you can explore, which will help you. :)"

  body: In this instance, it's kind of a "no harm-no foul" deal, since the font itself
    is freeware. However, if the poster wants the name of the font, it's gonna cost
    him =)

  body: I'm not trying to steal, hrant. I just thought a kind person with more knowledge
    of fonts could assist me in answering the question. I was given a very informative
    answer from the website where I saw the font.
