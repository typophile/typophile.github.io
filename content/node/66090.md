  of the print.\r\nThank you."

  body: Looks a lot like Monotype Plantin to me (though it is not a 19th-century type).

  body: "Thank you for the comments,\r\nPlatin looks perfect, but (and please bear
    with me, I know next to nothing about typography): Platin seems not to have the
    differing heights in the numerals.\r\n\r\nWould you be able to suggest some other
    fonts that are similar (similar weight and style as Platin, and with the different
    height numerals.)\r\n\r\nActually, the closest I have come so far is Georgia (and
    perhaps it is an overused web-font); but I am sure there is better.\r\n\r\nThank
    you again."

    Copernicus</a> and <a href="http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=16">Musee</a>.
    Both are based on Plantin. Old style figures are available, if not by default,
    via Opentype.
