  body: "I've used it few times, right from the very early versions (1.0.3) and recently
    a newer version (1.4.3)\r\nIt has much improved since those early days.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it seems to cause havoc with my whole system. I'm still on OSX 10.6.8 (don't ask
    !)\r\nI over-rides the functionality of FontBook, and previewing of fonts, and
    I don't like that.\r\nSo I totally removed it from my system using CleanMyMac.\r\n\r\nI
    also found when using 1.4.3 that I could not adjust some text that had been created
    using Fontlab.\r\nI use someone else to do my kerning, and he says he uses it,
    but I've yet to be convinced.\r\nKnowing me, I'm probably doing it all wrong.

  body: "Thanks for both your answers. \r\n\r\nEliason, I\u2019d like to learn more
    about your experiences, if it improved your workflow, if you feel it is advanced
    in designing and editing a font in comparison with the now somewhat dated FontLab.\r\n\r\nDjnippa,
    your issues may relate to the font cache in Mac OS: http://www.glyphsapp.com/tutorials/eliminating-font-cache-problems"

  body: "I use it\u2026 it's hard for me to imagine anything that could be improved.
    I did have one feature request, but they have a plugin SDK, so I just wrote a
    plugin. \r\n\r\nIn-context editing (combined text/edit view) is a must-have. If
    I understand correctly, FontLab doesn't have this.\r\n\r\nI looked at RoboFont
    briefly, but it would take too much tinkering. I really don't mind writing Python,
    but why bother if Glyphs does what I want? I'd rather spend time making a typeface."

  body: "I moved to Glyphs from FontLab, and for my purposes it has been an entirely
    positive shift. To my mind it has a far more intuitive and usable interface, better
    stability, and much more responsive developers. \r\nIt is set up to be easy to
    get started with, and for that I think it has a reputation as a beginners' editor
    (compared to FontLab and especially RoboFont), but I think it is less well known
    that there is a lot of power and control available through the program. I have
    yet to encounter an aspect of typeface generation where it seemed that Glyphs
    was making a decision for me and I wasn't able to change it. (To be sure, there
    are others with more complicated needs than mine who might run into limitations.)\r\nGlyphs
    is a pleasant environment to work in, and there's every indication that developers
    will continue to make it better at a good pace and in smart ways. It was an excellent
    purchase for me."

  body: "Thanks for all your answers, they were quite helpful. It appears to me that
    of the current set of editors, Glyphs may be the most modern one, also more user
    friendly, if I compare it with RoboFont, for an example. I am not good at writing
    code and I need automated processes, say for multiple masters and interpolation,
    to create families and super families.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, the \u201Clight\u201D
    version of Glyphs doesn\u2019t let you create multiple masters in layers, so I
    could imagine this contributed to the \u201Cbeginners\u201D reputation.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I like in FontLab is the integration of OpenType classes and how kerning can be
    automated, to a degree, say for diacritics (o has the same kerning like \xF8 and
    \xF6, for an example). I am particularly interested in interpolation, multiple
    master abilities and metrics/kerning in Glyphs. Currently I am going through tutorials
    to get a better understanding of how these things are handled.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank
    you, also for the critical remarks."
