If you have, I am really interested in your motivation for donating your design work to the public domain. Did you do it because you are a believer in &quot;free culture?&quot; Did you do it because you judged your font to be &quot;noncommercial?&quot; Did you do it for self-promotion?

		<div class="commentbody">I think there are a number of reasons why type designers give fonts away. Here a few that come to mind: <BR> <BR><b>1. Promotional purposes.</b> The idea is to give away a free sample to generate interest and good will with hopes that people will pay for other fonts offered. <BR> <BR><b>2. Specialized non-commercial niche.</b> There are some areas such as academia or hobbies for which type designers, usually amateurs, create fonts to fulfill some special purpose. The fonts are given away out of a sense of sharing with others who have the same interest. <BR> <BR><b>3. Lack of confidence.</b> Novice type designers or others who may just be dabbling in type design give fonts away just because they don't think their fonts are good enough to charge money. Often, these fonts are incomplete or untested. By giving the font away, the designer absolves him or herself of responsibility for how the font performs. (I suspect that most freeware fonts fall into this category.) <BR> <BR><b>4. Idealism.</b> Some type designers give away their fonts as part of the free software subculture. This is a nice idea, but I suspect these people have some other source of income and lots of free time. (BTW, giving away commercial fonts created by others is not idealism, it's piracy.) <BR> <BR><b>5. Hopelessness.</b> Some type designers give away their fonts in the belief that it's not possible to make money in type design (not actually true, btw) and see it as a &quot;labor of love.&quot; <BR> <BR><b>6. Public service.</b> Sometimes a fonts designed for some practical purpose are given away to gain wide distribution, such as web fonts or system fonts. It may also be that free alternatives are already available from other sources. Bitstream's free Vera fonts are an example of this. Their commercial font business does well enough that they can afford to do this as a public service. My font <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/anonymous.html" target="_blank">Anonymous</a> is a similar case. On one hand, it was derived from an existing freeware bitmap font and it only seemed right to keep it free. On the other hand, I saw it as a way to draw visitors to my site and demonstrate the quality of the commercial fonts I offer (see reason 1 above). <BR> <BR><b>7. Lack of authorship.</b> By this I mean people who trace or autotrace existing fonts from old specimen books, often without much skill, and give fonts their fonts away because they wouldn't feel right about charging for something that took so little effort. (This can be like numbers 3 and 4 above, but for people without original ideas.) <BR> <BR>I'm sure there are other reasons, and I'm sure that some of these are colored by my own point of view as someone who makes a substantial part of his income from selling fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have not yet released a real font, but plan to release my <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/">Century Catalogue</a> under a free software license. I'm not sure about the others; in part, we'll see how the first one goes. <BR> <BR>I have a good reason to release the CCat for free; I would like it to be one of a set of fonts useful for typesetting mathematics in TeX, and for it to have any real chance of catching on, it has to be released as free software. Otherwise, among other things, it won't ship with Linux distributions and so on. In addition to TeX, I'm developing some of my <a href="http://ghilbert.org">own</a> mathematics software (derived from Metamath, also released as free software, in this case GPL), and, again, I'd very much like this font to be part of the free release. <BR> <BR>All seven of Mark's points apply, to different degrees. The <i>design</i> of Century Catalogue is clearly in the public domain, although I am putting a lot of effort into making a good digitization. <BR> <BR>I have not yet chosen the actual license under which I will distribute the font. It will almost certainly be compatible with the <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>, as that is pretty much the gold standard for making sure that the license is compatible with other free software. I doubt seriously it will be public domain. I would like to keep rip-off artists from piling my font in with a trillion others on scammy download sites and pay CD's, I would like to, but I am not yet sure to what extent that's possible while still remaining within the DFSG.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I respect your goals of releasing your font and mathematics work free, Raph, but I really don't get the concept. Academics are paid by their universities, and don't get paid for journal articles. It makes sense to follow that model to some extent if you are being paid as an academic, but I gather you are a graduate student. Your font is an impressive piece of work and I am sure took many weeks of full days to produce. Your math work probably much more. Will you be compensated in some way for your time and your accomplishments?  <BR> <BR>This - a font and perhaps your math publishing software - is different from a Journal article in that it is a product that is sold for use. I can see that an operating system like linux, which is massive and many people can make contributions to, can fruitfully grow open source. But I really wonder about applications, which is what you are developing here.</div>

If they get paid for designing type or creating math software, then they can go on doing it. If they don't they have to do something else.   <BR> <BR>That is why philosophically, I think the 'free work' concept is bogus - just as those who think nobody is hurt by pirating music, because it 'ought' to be free. <BR> <BR>Of course hobbyists can do good work, but sustained excellence of somebody like a Matthew Carter just isn't going to happen unless they get paid. There are free niches, but it is an illusion to think the market can get excellence without paying somebody for it.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick: yes, I think that selling an OpenType version commercially may well be the way to go. It's not so much a matter of poshness as how the features are packaged. TeX does in fact do small caps, but accomplishes them by choosing a different optical scale of the base font. Yes, TeX does optical scaling, and has since before Microsoft Word was in diapers. This is one of the reasons why doing an optically scaled series of this font is so appealing &ndash; people will be able to use the optical scaling without having to twist themselves into pretzels. You are correct that TeX does not have oldstyle figures in its base glyph complement, and that they're unusual in math setting. <BR> <BR>From a technical point of view, I'd need to distribute the free version as a PostScript Type 1 font, because that's what the PDF export from TeX needs as its raw materials. TeX's own font format, Metafont, is pretty much dead these days. <BR> <BR>I have deep roots in the free software culture, but am not a fanatic. In this particular case, it's mostly a pragmatic decision. Many, many companies have tried to build proprietary extensions on top of TeX (including simply selling fonts for it), with absolutely no success. I would much rather see my work used and the overall typographic quality of math publications raised than follow those footsteps. <BR> <BR>In any case, I don't believe that free software is for everybody, but have warm feelings for its own particular strengths and charms. In any case, William, the analogy here is not people who pirate music, but people who release their own music for free. Maybe that does depress the market for commercial work, but at the same time I doubt that Britney Spears' corporate owners lose much sleep over the vast quantities of jam band music available at etree.org. <BR> <BR>I'd also like to bring up the EULA issue; users of my free fonts will be able to add new glyphs or otherwise customize them, without having to worry about running afoul of the EULA.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;the analogy here is not people who pirate music, but people who release their own music for free <BR> <BR>That is true. My point was that some who pirate music - and perhaps also fonts - do it on the excuse that it all 'ought to be' free. And that argument I was rejecting.  <BR> <BR>It sounds like for the market you want to serve, there is no way to be compensated directly for it. But my point is that being compensated will sustain you to do other worthwhile projects of your choosing. So if you can include the font as part of your math publishing software, and charge for that, all the better, in my view. If that must be free, well so be it; I just worry about you being able to sustain the fine work you are doing.  <BR> <BR>Good luck with all of it!</div>

I think that GPL or other freely licensed fonts may be an excellent alternative for people who want to keep things squeaky-clean. <BR> <BR>Indeed, we've seen exactly this happen with the Ghostscript fonts. The company I work for, Artifex Software, started the ball rolling by licensing the rights from URW to release a complete set of PostScript Level 2 clone fonts under the GPL. Valek Filippov then added Cyrillic glyphs and released his new versions. This version was picked up by Red Hat for Linux distributions, with some fixes and touch-ups by Owen Taylor. Today, we distribute the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/get850.htm">1.06</a> version of these fonts, and plan to set up a repository to import the <a href="http://they.com/doc/gsfonts/">newest (1.07pre22)</a> version, which lots of extra <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2004/06/msg00023.html">local language support</a>, including Uzbek and Vietnamese.

Perhaps I should be giving those away. Another category, Vanity Publishing? <BR> <BR>But maybe not. Typefaces that are not popular now may catch on in the future.

		<div class="commentbody">As someone who gave away over 200 fonts, I think I can add something to the discussion. Idealism and public service did have something to do with it but, for me, it was a way of cutting my teeth, typographically speaking, and a way of determining where the public's taste lie. <BR> <BR>A lot of my earliest (1997) stuff was, in retrospect, pretty crappy (mostly spacing issues, but some design inconsistencies, too). Practice, practice, practice, and things gradually improved. But progress is not made in a vacuum: I have to acknowledge a tremendous debt to Ilene Strizver, who helped me develop my commercial releases through ITC and Agfa Monotype. <BR> <BR>I probably would have continued developing freeware fonts while peddling commercial ones as well, if not for a few sad facts&hellip; <BR> <BR>a) if you give stuff away, there are sorry bastards out there who will steal it and sell it; and <BR> <BR>b) if you give stuff away, there are clueless individuals out there who somehow expect you to personally give them more of your time (I want you to design a font for me, or copy someone else's design, or re-design your website to suit me, or&hellip;). <BR> <BR>I'm not sure which is worse, the thieves or the ingrates, but eventually I got fed up with feeding their kind (so much for the idealismj argument). So, was it all worth it? For the experience AND the exposure, yes, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Amy: Sergei was undoubtedly being ironic. The free software philosophy is that sharing code that one writes is a public service, much like offering advice and help when asked. <BR> <BR>I just did a little surfing, and found that most of the standard fonts shipping as free software are missing from dafonts; I checked the Nimbus family (from URW, clones of the Adobe Postscript base set), Vera, and Utopia. Does anybody have more insight into this?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Raph - Nimbus a clone of the Adobe Postscript set? Where do you get your information from?  <BR> <BR>1. Adobe wouldn't have Helvetica at all if it weren't for URW, because Adobe couldn't get their Helvetica actually to work with ATM until URW kindly helped them out with completely new data. You know, it's one thing to acquire the rights to the name 'Helvetica'. It's quite another to be able to digitize and manufacture it. That Adobe could not do. <BR> <BR>2. URW Nimbus is considered by Helvetica experts to be one of the three families of improved Helveticas, which comprise [whatever Berthold calls the version of AkGro which is in fact an improved Helvetica - is it AG Buch? I forget], Helvetica Neue, and URW Nimbus. I believe I have those in the right chronological order. An improved Helvetica was actually first designed by Berthold; Linotype then did its version, and Karow considers Nimbus Sans to be an amalgamation of the best ideas of all three. Karow's claim is not idle boasting, as JM's post illustrates. <BR> <BR>In any case, Berthold was first with the idea of fixing some of Helvetica's more egregious faults. Lino Neue Helvetica was a response.</div>
