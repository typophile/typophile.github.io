    instead of from the page on which they have been printed, resulting in a more
    fragile form. Types such as Monotype Bembo, Spectrum, and Centaur are victims
    of this &#40;so I&#39;ve read&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also, in letterpress no two letters
    looked exactly alike because of the ink impression. <a href="http://www.letterror.com/foundry/beowolf/index.html">Beowolf</a>
    from LettError is a response to that. The font is &#34;programmed&#34; to produce
    variations of the same letter in a sequence. <BR> <BR>These are just a couple
    of things off the top of my head. I&#39;m sure others here can give some good
    insight. <BR> <BR>-Addison

  body: During the revival period I believe many metal faces were redrawn from printed
    specimens sheets, but many, if not most, of the faces that are associated with
    the metal type libraries of Linotype, Monotype, Ludlow, have actually been digitized
    from photofilm versions. Um, with the notable exception of Lanston. And brilliant
    that was Gerald G. <BR> <BR>I know of a few exceptions with Monotype Typography
    as well. The digital Dante and, most likely the Pastonchi, were redrawn from master
    patterns of the metal type. <BR> <BR>I believe that at one point Ludlow UK was
    quite intent on buying up old Ludlow film from a source in Canada for their digitizations.
    <BR> <BR>But to get more to the original question. You would not actually want
    to preserve a metal face per se for digital as you would not have wanted to for
    photofilm. The printing technologies associated with these type technologies have/had
    different needs and require/d different approaches. <BR> <BR>Reversing the situation,
    printing digital type letterpress, is a whole other animal. There, yes, the considerations
    of the how and why of the design of a metal type face are quite crucial, and not
    easily replicated with the available tools. <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: Knuth illustrated a curious tendacy of type technologies replicating earlier
    type technologies. For reasons of no merit the new technologies never returned
    to source. The film fonts were bolder than letterpress, the digital fonts, bolder
    than film fonts. <BR> <BR>The digital rendition I believe was the work of Autologic.
    The typface was Janson.  <BR> <BR>I later noticed that even letterpress typefounders
    blackened their imitations of other founders typefaces. The Caslon Foundry blackened
    their own letterpress Caslon Oldstyle in the refitting in 1924&#40;?&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>Modern typographers would make great balloon blowers at childrens birthday
    parties. Eventually I predict type will be so inflated paper will be black. <BR>
    <BR>Thankfully Gerald Lange and myself have avoided this disease by keeping several
    ounces of black ink under our fingernails. <BR> <BR>Most people never wish to
    shake our blackened hands which allows us great freedom in opinion, such as, &#34;light
    is bright, bold is black&#34;, &#34;Lead is not dead&#34; and that is why &#34;letterpress
    printers rock&#34;. <BR> <BR>I hope I made my point?

  body: 'Probably the biggest loss that comes to mind is optical scaling. In metal,
    each size was inherently different anyway, but when automatic scaling was introduced
    &#40;way before phototype - I&#39;m talking about the Benton pantograph&#41; the
    desire to save money overpowered quality. The good news is that some designers
    are slowly coming back to optical scaling. <BR> <BR>Another thing that was lost
    is the softness of the border between black and white. I think this might actually
    be the main reason letterpress is more readable &#40;when done really well&#41;.
    I have a hunch that offset is simply too crisp, and our perceptive system cannot
    become very comfortable with such stark borders. I can think of one way to address
    this issue: unfocus the laser in an imagesetter &#40;but microscopically&#41;.
    As an aside, I don&#39;t think either the randomness or the relief effect of letterpress
    are really important/positive. Randomness is lack of information, and we don&#39;t
    read with our fingers &#40;unless it&#39;s Braille&#41;. <BR> <BR>And a third
    thing is trapping. In the metal days: a size couldn&#39;t be used larger, so traps
    would never become obvious/distracting; and bleed was greater, so trapping was
    more necessary. In digital, traps are still necessary much of the time, but not
    enough to &#34;register&#34; in the mind of most designers. Interestingly, phototype
    was really hazy so they actually used a lot of traps - and they even used thorns:
    the sharp protrusions at corners to help them keep their sharpness. Virtually
    nobody does thorns in digital type.  <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>But we&#39;ve also gained
    a lot. Most of all <i>potential</i>, even though it remains largely unrealized.

  body: Hrant <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always been amazed by the lack of optical sizing in
    digital fonts. Not so much by the failure of most foundries to provide it, but
    in the failure of typographers to incorporate it in their routine design, especially
    so since the tools for creating even a basic rendering of optical scale by ranking
    weights was available quite early on. Fontographer was the most long lived of
    these, followed now by FontLab. <BR> <BR>In regard to letterpress, hey!!! The
    relief effect is much more cherished today than it was during most of the history
    of printing. Printers would do anything to get rid of it, calendaring the paper
    after printing, dampening the paper afterward, etc. But on randomness I will have
    to disagree. You are speaking of distortion caused during printing I assume.  <BR>
    <BR>Don&#39;t know if you knew this though. It has long been thought that randomness
    was deliberately incorporated into many of the typefaces of the early printers,
    up until the beginning of the type foundry and the standardization of casting
    production. New evidence on the DK-Type, attributed to Gutenberg, suggests that
    it is possible that the single letterforms may have been composites of variant
    letterform pieces put together in punch form and cast that way to mimick the natural
    variance of handwritten letterforms. <BR> <BR>Does this effect readability? Certainly
    the earliest printers must have thought it crucial to the potential readers &#40;buyers&#41;
    of their time to simulate as much as possible the handwritten word. I don&#39;t
    want to go Emigre on you but... <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: Mr. Giampa, <BR> <BR>Thanks for linking to that article--I had looked for
    it to link in my post. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure where I stand on the inkspread
    issue, but I&#39;ve found it interesting. Perhaps it&#39;s personal preference,
    but I can certainly tell a difference between digital Bembo and the metal Monotype
    version in a copy of Fine Print &#40;or one of Mr. Tufte&#39;s books&#41; and
    I prefer the metal. Many foundries are now creating optical sizes, or at least
    text and display, as opposed to one homogenized font--a great improvment. <BR>
    <BR>I have a printed copy of your Caslon specimen and a copy of the 1924 G.W.
    Jones Caslon specimen. I&#39;ll have to take a closer look and compare the digital
    to metal. &#40;Your Caslon specimen is very lovely, by the way.&#41; <BR> <BR>Tell
    me this, Mr. Giampa. Frederic Goudy cut his own type, right? Did he anticipate
    the finer execution of printing that you expect? In other words, do you feel your
    digital versions of his types live up to his &#40;Goudy&#39;s&#41; expectations
    of his metal types? And please, this is no attack--I just want to know your opinion.

    <BR> <BR>No way dude. <BR> <BR>&#62; were the concavities scaled for size in metal?
    <BR> <BR>That would be interesting to check. I&#39;m actually working on that

    exagerate the concavity &#40;and really every other feature that deviates from
    the &#34;orthonormal&#34;&#42;&#41; then that just means he <i>should</i> have!
    One interesting think about Optima is that it seems the concavity was originally
    a technical compensation &#40;for fighting gain&#41;, and not a bone fide design
    feature! It&#39;s only when some boss at a font house liked the effect at large
    sizes that it became a &#34;feature&#34;. Ironic, considering it&#39;s the font&#39;s
    main attraction. <BR> <BR>&#42; For example, overshoots &#40;like in the &#34;o&#34;&#41;

    could compare Goudy&#39;s work with Hrant&#39;s. If you like Hrant&#39;s better
    stick with his opinion. If you like Goudy&#39;s well you can stick with your own.
    <BR> <BR>I think it unfair to speak so poorly of the dead. Especially when their
    work still lives so strongly in the faces of America. Goudy is to American Type
    Design what Frank Lloyd Wright or the Greene brothers are to American Architecture,
    or Starling Burgess to American Yacht Design. Goudy is perhaps the greatest type
    designer that ever lived. <BR> <BR>But maybe your prefer Hrant? This is for you

    <BR> <BR>Hey, you&#39;re &#34;Mr Lanston&#34;! So you tell me &#40;I honestly
    don&#39;t know&#41;: Did the original metal Californian have optical scaling or

    <BR> <BR>And well done, too, Nick.  <BR> <BR>My implied point still stands; for
    the most part, thorns in phototype were a compensation for a photo problem. That
    problem no longer exists, so the general need for thorns in digital type also
    no longer exists. &#40;Hrant seems to be implying, above, that today&#39;s digital
    designers are somehow lazier than their forebears for not including thorns in
    their designs. Perhaps this is not what he meant.&#41; <BR> <BR>Nevertheless,
    there are specialized circumstances where they may still be of some value. <BR>
    <BR><i>&#62;&#62; How did they save money?  <BR>&#62;By making one &#40;or at
    least fewer&#42;&#41; set of drawings, of course. </i> <BR> <BR>It should be noted
    that the initial impetus for the creation of the pantographic punchcutter was
    not to circumvent the process of optical scaling, as one might surmise from Hrant&#39;s
    rant. <BR> <BR>The primary reason for the development of the pantographic punchcutter
    was to allow a person who was not necessarily trained or skilled at punchcutting,
    to cut a punch by directly following a [much larger] drawing. The device reduced
    the artistic and mechanical skills that were previously required to interpret
    a designer&#39;s design and cut it very small on the end of a piece of metal.
    This opened the doors to increased productivity in converting paper designs into
    metal fonts.  <BR> <BR>The fact that one could cut different sizes from the same
    master was a corollary efficiency that some foundries leapt at, while others did
    not. Linotype, for instance, created separate drawings for every size. M. F. Benton
    sometimes made different drawings for different sizes of certain letters -- those
    that could not be optically adapted by adjusting different parameters of the pantograph
    &#40;or so I understand from conversations with Mike Parker, who studied Benton&#39;s
    drawings at the Smithsonian&#41;. <BR> <BR>So although the demise of optical sizes
    can be traced to the invention of the pantographic cutter, that was not the goal
    of its invention. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    is its cultural &#34;contribution&#34;: the de facto reduction of optical fidelity.
    I think the pantograph was a success because of its scaling more than anything

    but when I asked him if he could provide me with the original scan/source of the
    image -because I was interested in the history of trapping- he refused on the
    grounds that I was seeing things. Unsurprisingly, this FTD doesn&#39;t put traps
    in his fonts, and is against the practice. Maybe he didn&#39;t want me to find
