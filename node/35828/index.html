<p><strong>Q. I can go to my local Wal-Mart and get 3000 fonts for $19.95. How come your stuff is so pricey?</strong></p>
<p>A: You get what you pay for.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Seriously, what&rsquo;s the difference?</strong></p>
<p>A: We have a dedicated staff of nine people whose sole purpose is to make fonts and artwork for you. We have families, bills, health insurance, etc. Most of our collections are developed over a period of 18 to 24 months, so we have a huge investment in time and effort in each typeface and each piece of artwork. Come down to the studio some time and we&rsquo;ll show you.</p>

<p>Its the same problem the music industry has.  Does anyone remember the first time they saw a $22.99 sticker for a music CD and then magically that very same season Napster erupted as a household name and then all the sudden millions of teenagers were &ldquo;thieves&rdquo; - it put the industry into a freefall.</p>
<p>Implying that a potential customer is a thief or somehow unscrupulous for asking if he could find a quality product within his budget (notice he didn&rsquo;t say free, he just said $30 is ludicrous) is NOT good business.</p>

If the type industry let you get unpackaged single fonts for a reasonable price (try $5) i think you&rsquo;d see instant success. Especially for headline fonts. Who would ever use &ldquo;Coop-Flaired-super-ultra-black-italic-monospaced&rdquo; anyway??? - its the same as asking if anyone ever listens to more than the first track of a Wang Chung album.  People would still buy the entire family for great fonts like Thesis and Scala.

<p>It would be nice if there was a field at the retail sites telling how many hours were put into a font or set (broken down into categories like design, spacing/kerning, testing, etc). Even allowing for efficiency of work, we would then have some sort of guage at how ridiculous a price really is. There is probably a good chance some are even a bargain at $30.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Fontpla - i agree with the gist. I think part of my skepticism comes from the &ldquo;man-hours&rdquo; argument tho.</p>
<p>The fact is a font is not just a singular work of art - its also mass liscensed and mass distributed consumer design element, like a tube of paint.  In that arena, the &ldquo;man-hours&rdquo; argument just doesnt work because its supply and demand - the supply is virtually infinite and the demand is large (as seen in the number of &ldquo;thieves&rdquo;.  Fonts are NOT &ldquo;limited edition&rdquo; and therefore should not be sold at &ldquo;limited edition&rdquo; prices.</p>
<p>My argument is that if you package it better, in more managable increments, you&rsquo;ll sell more and make more money and maybe even have the competition to make better product.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Perception of cheapness is relative.  Certain fonts are certainly worth the money based on their merits alone.  most are not, when you consider that in the long run, one font goes only so far for a designer. The entire helvetica font family retails for nearly the retail price of Indesign, and that&rsquo;s just weird to me.</p>
<p>I just think that many times it get wrapped up in what they think a font &ldquo;should cost&rdquo; rather than thinking of how a foundry could sell more units and get more good design out there.</p>
<p>heh - I&rsquo;m more interested in a &ldquo;IKEA&rdquo; for fonts than an &ldquo;itunes&rdquo;  Great design, widely distributed, for less!</p>

<p>A ballpoint pen is &ldquo;simple.&rdquo; with no infrastructure, a ballpoint pen would cost the equivalent of millions of dollars and thousands of manhours to reproduce.  Even with the infrastructure, a ton of sweat and and work and design goes into a ballpoint pen. Yet a pen is 99 cents and is incredibly lucrative. With computers, just as many people potentially use fonts today as use pens. In a market economy, a font is in fact &ldquo;simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A font is like any other type of industrial design.  A michael graves toaster from Target can be a legitimately amazing, beautiful piece of design and have all the soul and sweat and artistic achievement in the world, and still be dirt cheap.</p>
<p>The consumer&rsquo;s expectations aren&rsquo;t the problem&hellip;it&rsquo;s usually the suppliers' business model.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There may also be a coolness factor that took some marketing to achieve. Marketing takes money.</p>
<p>I remember in the &rsquo;70s that the communists would have us believe it was OK to steal anything as long as you muttered &ldquo;For the people!&rdquo; while stealing it, which is the logical extention of telling people what they can sell their unique product for, or it will be stolen.</p>
<p>If the product isn&rsquo;t that unique, then why not use something else?</p>
<p>People have a right to charge what the market will bear. If they are going for an exclusive clientele, they have that right.</p>
<p>There are millions? of font choices, and if you can&rsquo;t manage to create something nice using a lower costing alternative, than that doesn&rsquo;t say much for your design ability.</p>
<p>Bottom line, art, in general, is not supported as most artists would like. But if an artist can make a decent living for themselves and maybe employ others too, then rock on!</p>

A font going out of style is essentially the same as a font going obsolete in an industry based on trends. If a font can&rsquo;t be used to make money, it is useless.  Designers for the most part won&rsquo;t pay for fonts they don&rsquo;t intend to use in their business.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>&hellip;its really a sad state of affairs when an industry has to start splitting its potential clientele into two groups: “thieves” and “not-thieves.” that’s usually an indication that prices are out of control.</em></p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not that simple. You make that polarization, not us.</p>
<p><em>Its the same problem the music industry has.</em></p>
<p>No it is not.</p>
<p><em>&hellip;the font liscencers are a little bit guilty of having a copyright monopoly - such that prices aren’t competitively brought down by market forces.</em></p>
<p>Absolute twaddle. We have no &ldquo;copyright monopoly&rdquo;. Copyright &lsquo;law&rsquo; in the U.S practically undermines the very principal of copyright. Font prices <strong>are</strong> set by supply and demand. The market pays what it thinks fonts are worth&mdash;the price(s) they sell for.</p>
<p><em>The problem is that they have control of virtually infinite copyrights - that guarantee out of proportion prices and lead to this sort of “sticker shock.”</em></p>
<p>Nope. It is obvious in the extreme to myself and other type professionals here that you have a very slim grasp of how the font industry really works and how prices are determined. The only &ldquo;sticker shock&rdquo; is experienced by unprofessional designers and unprofessional font users whose expectations of price are unrealistic, and unprofessional.</p>
<p><em>&hellip;i think you’d see instant success.</em></p>
<p>The type industry is quite successful the way things are, thankyou. What makes you think there is a lack of success?</p>
<p><em>The fact is a font is not just a singular work of art - its also mass liscensed and mass distributed consumer design element, like a tube of paint.</em></p>
<p>Fonts are not mass-consumed. In the case of commercial fonts they are commercially consumed, but not <em>en masse</em> the way music and films are.</p>
<p><em>I’m more interested in a “IKEA” for fonts than an “itunes” Great design, widely distributed, for less!</em></p>
<p>If you think IKEA furniture is great design you need to discover real furniture.</p>
<p><em>A font is like any other type of industrial design.</em></p>
<p>No.
It.
Is.
Not.</p>
<p>Fonts are not mass-consumed like toasters and the same market economics do not apply.</p>
<p>In your view fonts are preposterously-priced, but possibly you are forgetting that both large foundries and independents give away at least one high quality font for free, as an incentive to customers. It&rsquo;s also a nice way of showing that we&rsquo;re not consumed with making a buck or obsessed with control of our intellectual property.</p>

<p>Maybe it is just because I remember when a filmstrip for a Comp II used to cost the same as my weekly salary. And that was one font: bold or italic with regular, but not both. And this would wear out, if not from use over a few years, then through obsolence when the machines were updated every four or five years. I still have PC fonts from 1988.</p>
<p>I think we are getting a good deal for what we pay. People who want free fonts can get them from the free collections. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me when they have to spend hours cleaning their font lists when some crude freebie crashes Photoshop. My quality fonts will never do that.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. Some fonts are very expensive. Many project are not large budgets. So, sticker shock isn&rsquo;t that rare of an event.</p>
<p>Not that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with selling one&rsquo;s fonts at a premium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think IKEA furniture is great design you need to discover real furniture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a piece of commercial design, meeting price points that appeal to the consumer is a major factor of the success of the design.</p>
<p>There seems to be room for premium priced fonts and more mass market fonts. Both can and do seem to exist side by side just fine.</p>
<p>Can one sell more than 10 times the units if they sell a font at $10 rather than $100? I have no idea.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect market forces to work &ldquo;correctly&rdquo; under virtual monopolistic circumstances.</p>
<p>If Apple, Adobe and Microsoft didn&rsquo;t bundle hundreds of fonts for free with their apps, there might be the kind of mass market where indie font manufacturers could reduce prices to a few dollars, because we would be shifting tens of thousands of font licences, rather than hundreds.</p>
<p>However, don&rsquo;t expect things to remain the same either. It may be possible for reputable independent foundries to develop high volume, low price marketing models, as the industry progresses. After all, as a retail phenomenon, the indie font business only really got started in around 1999, with e-commerce, and is still gathering steam. Note the low price of some impressively stacked Opentype fonts in the Myfonts best-sellers; a lot of value there.</p>
<p><em>copyright monopoly</em></p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t have much to do with it (see above).
However, copyright protection is probably a bit too long. William St Clair found that when it was 12-24 years (for literary works), that produced the most dynamic cultural effects (in his book<em> The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period</em>).</p>
<p>With a controlled market and long copyright protection, St Clair found a situation where the dominant businesses produced new material at high prices, allowing them to milk their legacy assets, in various price brackets geared to different levels of purchaser, for long periods of time. I&rsquo;m not quite sure how that compares with fonts. It&rsquo;s hard to compare intellectual property for physical and digital products, and I haven&rsquo;t finished his book yet, let alone tried to figure out how it fully relates to fonts.</p>

<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t downplay how much work it takes to design a font.  It takes a huge amount of work to design anything the right way.  This isn&rsquo;t about what fonts should cost. its about what fonts could cost if potential markets were tapped.</p>
<p>All i can say is that design is super-hip right now. Vastly, astoundingly HIP. You just have to teach a certain market segment to care about something that is quite opaque (like where their font folder is hidden on their cute little macbook.)</p>
<p>I definetly agree about the Adobe, Mac, Microsoft monopoly. However, i think the fact that if you google &ldquo;font&rdquo; half of what comes up is THOUSANDS OF FREE FONTS!!! FREE FREE FREE!!!! is even worse for business. People want to pay and are dubious of the choice between free and expensive. I think it would be better to convince them to sell their fonts for even the tiniest amount.  I&rsquo;d really like to see a middle ground, a &ldquo;student grade&rdquo; so to speak.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Holy cow, have I ever been hammered on my earlier comments. Mostly I&rsquo;m glad someone called me funny. Okay, to some, my logos suck, and I&rsquo;m a terrible designer, and I guess that very well could be true&hellip;subjectively, anyway. I&rsquo;m not saying nobody can design a decent type face, I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty of you out there who can. No&hellip;I KNOW there are plenty of people out there who can. All I&rsquo;m saying is that there are lots of good ones out there already, and with the world going to hell the way it is, maybe sooner or later we (including me) should all concentrate on something else. Is that really so ignorant?  But that&rsquo;s not type talk, and maybe you&rsquo;re right, maybe I am just an attention getting ego-maniac. I like to think of it as stirring the pot. Peace to you all, honestly.</div>

<p>Ray&rsquo;s comment from left field on the justification of the Wang Chung example wins.</p>
<p>I do understand that premium fonts often come with premium prices, but it seems more like there isn&rsquo;t really a mid-level market of typefaces.</p>
<p>I see the font market much like the market for buying sunglasses. You can get the cheap-o $5 sunglasses at any drug store, the $30 sunglasses at a department store, the $120 sunglasses at a boutique, or blow $600 for the custom designer shades at a fancy shop in a world-class city. But what if you want to pay something like $75? The options become much more limited at that mid-level price.</p>
<p>And yet, they&rsquo;re still just sunglasses - stylish pieces of plastic to protect your eyes from the sun. You could look through the stadium bleachers for a free lost pair if you had the time and patience for such a thing (and the willingness to put up with many a broken pair).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi there:</p>
<p>Spottedfeather&gt; As much everyone in this thread thinks they know you, they don&rsquo;t. WE DON&rsquo;T KNOW YOUR SITUATION. If $30 (or the $255 you&rsquo;ll have to pay to actually get Coop Flaired) is too much for you to pay- that&rsquo;s fine. There are alternatives of similar stylization that might interest you.</p>
<p>Browse this foundrys' listings
<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/btn/">http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/btn/</a></p>
<p>Specifically:
<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/grilled-cheese-btn/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/grilled-cheese-btn/</a></p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The bold weight of this font is very close to Coop Flaired
<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/hawaiian-aloha-btn/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/hawaiian-aloha-btn/</a></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/roller-world-btn/">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/roller-world-btn/</a></p>
<p>Yes these fonts are for-pay, but 12.99 surely beats the 200 plus you have to put out. As for me I would not even spend 2 cents on Coop- its the ugliest thing in the world. That&rsquo;s me. But House Industries- the foundry- makes a quality product. This means that the metrics (letter spacing), glyph design, hinting (how well it looks on screen) is virtually perfect. And that' where the higher price come from.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say all quality fonts are well priced- Device Fonts (cute but pricey) , Gary Munch&rsquo;s Really, and everything by Red Rooster is stupidly priced!</p>
<p>But anyway- I hope I have helped you. And don&rsquo;t listen to the goons in this thread. Typophile can be a great resource- use it to your advantage.</p>
<p>All my best to you,</p>
<p>Mike Diaz :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think there are a few threads on Typophile right now that are moments away from becoming insult-fests. It is ok for someone not to be able to afford a $30 font. I think it is far better that the person is making an effort to rightfully license a font that they can afford rather than trolling with the pirates looking for a copy of Coop to use without proper licensing.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it is what is done with the font that matters not the original cost (or quality) of the font.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep it above board and not go around insulting anyone.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Agreed with the recent comment by Miss Tiffany, and crazily this was on my mind last night. I want apologize myself for the comments I made that ruffled a few feathers. I used an exaggerated number for effect, the point being that with the digital age, there are now a LOT of cooks in the kitchen, and while we many of us deserve to be paid like professionals, we cannot demand it, or whine about it when it doesn&rsquo;t happen. Which is why I work for peanuts within my small rural community (population 4,335), and often give my services away to folks that cannot afford to pay for anything. Please, all, understand that I personally appreciate all of your efforts in making this a more graphically beautiful world.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First off &hellip; I love you all</p>
<p>Just because you care</p>
<p>there&rsquo;s a hand-full of you whose comments brought our office to loud Hurrahs  (as I read aloud this article in particular)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to add my own comments on this subject:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>there was a time when my pay-rate was such that it was worth it to my boss to pay for the 10+ hours of font fixing required with free (usually un-tested) fonts. Incidentally  I was recently flattered when I was presented with a company credit card specifically for font buying (whooda thunk it) &hellip; I don&rsquo;t say this to brag (much) only to explain that as far as business models go it matters what&rsquo;s worth more, time or money. At this point in our firm&rsquo;s history, so-called &ldquo;luxury high-priced&rdquo; fonts are a money now VS money later decision &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the sad truth of the matter is that for every one of <em>US</em> there are forty or so for whom there exists less than a dozen fonts (Arial and TimesNR being the MVP&rsquo;s)and all the others are considered artsy fluff suitable for kindergarten teachers who want to gussy up their classroom. I get depressed just thinking about it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3)No one will care as much about a font as it&rsquo;s creator (save in certain cases where there&rsquo;s some idol worship involved [helvetica]), but this won&rsquo;t stop people from pouring their hearts into great design even at the risk of having their work summed up as &ldquo;such a simple thing&rdquo;. (personally, going back to the &ldquo;IKEA&rdquo; model, if I were to have some fantastic, useful, mass-marketed-high-design artifact that I designed referred to as &ldquo;such a simple thing&rdquo; I believe it would be a point of great pride &hellip; but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there)</p>
<p>that is all &hellip; thank you for bearing with my verbosity</p>
<p>-Pablo</p>

<p>Take Coop Flaired for instance- it&rsquo;s the Hannah Montana logo font. So now you got hundreds of little girls trying to make Hannah Montana banners and fan art and they want the font. At $225 for they Coop briefcase, how many have you sold to them? 0.</p>
