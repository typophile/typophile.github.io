  body: Don't know how "original" Mini 7 is. I think Silkscreen and Sevenet may have
    been around longer.

  body: "I dont think so, Stephen. I always thought that 'Mini 7' was way before the
    other two. Probably even the first pixel type, available to the masses. <em>(
    Beside system fonts, of course. )</em>\r\n\r\nQuoting Jason Kottke, the designer
    of 'Silkscreen', about 'Silkscreen' and 'Sevenet': <em>I'm a big fan of small,
    bitmappy fonts. I've been using a font called Sevenet (derived from Joe Gillespie's
    excellent Mini7) for a while now, but I didn't quite like the look of it...too
    wide. I wanted a font that was narrower and included a bold version. Silkscreen
    Expanded followed from Silkscreen as an alternative with more spacing in between
    the letters. I intend to keep using Sevenet as a wider complement to Silkscreen.</em>\r\n\r\nDav"
