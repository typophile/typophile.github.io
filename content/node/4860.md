body: working on logo for a project that will soon be known as Viral Media.   <BR>
  <BR>This organization will be responsible for creating an interchange between professional
  and amateur artist to share and sample materials from one another. Mainly music.  In
  a sense, this could become a record label of sorts. <BR> <BR>Main goal with logotype,
  have it work as a stencil and have all letters be connected.  This is both to fit
  the concept of &#39;continuum&#39; and future stencil applications of the brand
  &#40;in urban contexts&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I have been having some problems with the
  A.  I&#39;ve tried to have have the left side curve back to the right and almost
  meet it &#40;#0&#41;.  But then it looks too chunky between the R and A. <BR> <BR>In
  1, I was trying to have it swell at the bottom to meet the R.  Somewhat successful,
  but still looks wonky to me.  I had a crossbar in there at one point, but that didn&#39;t
  look right at all. <BR> <BR>In 2, I have the left side coming straight down to meet
  an adjusted R &#40;no swell at the bottom&#41;.  But then it looks like the right
  side of the A is higher up, due to its curvature.  Also looks too wide. <BR> <BR>So,
  now i am thinking either talk the client out the stencil idea or go for a more traditional
  monocular lower case A with two cuts &#40;one at the top, and one at the bottom&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Your help would be greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36428.gif"

  body: What if the lc_a wasn&#39;t connected at the top instead of the bottom? I&#39;m
    thinking about fast girls at thirstype. not that yours is like that, but the letters
    are disconnected, similar to the idea of stencils. I think it is fast girls c-cup.  <BR>
    <BR>Of your sketches, I think the more rigid the better. Flat and crisp in the
    join, but curve only in the letter where necessary. The dot over the lc_i helps.
