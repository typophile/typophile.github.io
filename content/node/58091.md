  a great set of chromatic fonts. But I\u2019m wondering if it would be worth the
  effort. The only chromatic font I see used often is Rosewood. I\u2019m also wary
  that if they did sell, I would end up getting a lot of support requests from users
  who don\u2019t have a clue how to set type in layers with Indesign, or worse, want
  them to work in Word. Does anybody have any experience selling chromatic fonts?"

    think that 99% of Rosewood users are people who use the fill layer because they\u2019re
    too cheap to buy a Clarendon ;) (no complaints about the people who use it correctly,
    tho)"

    guess if you do make layered fonts, you need to not mind that kind of stuff\u2026\r\nAlthough
    a nice manual might help. And re. History, Typotheque even made this <a href=\"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/history_remixer\">online
    app</a> that is supposed to help layering \u2013 so I imagine they were expecting
    people having trouble. It'd be interesting to know how successful the thing is."
