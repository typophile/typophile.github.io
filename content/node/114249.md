  body: "Your image shows a pixel typeface that, at least by my count, uses a 10 by
    14 grid for capital letters. I found a very similar pixel typeface on a 10 by
    14 grid, Pexico by  Ondrej J\xF3b http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urtd/pexico/\r\nSome
    letters, such as S, J & C are identical. Others differ in detail. \r\nI expect
    that, if this is not just a screen font generated by a computer, there is probably
    an exact match that can be found by further digging.\r\nDon\r\n"
