    I don't think it's the best font that you want, but you can get it easily from
    outside of Japan. There are some Ten sho fonts in Japan, but it's maybe hard to
    get them because most Japanese type vendors don't have English web pages."

  body: "Ah, thank you. I noticed the differences to regular kanji. So this is called
    \u7BC6\u66F8, okay. But I wasn't looking for that specifically.\r\n\r\nI was rather
    looking for any site with kanji fonts where I could start to look around. And
    I don't mind if it's in Japanese, I speak a little."
