  which is distributed\r\nunder the SIL Open Font License, version 1.1.\r\n\r\nSlanted
  Titillium to get the Titillioblique fonts.\r\nAdded some more interesting characters
  to make\r\na family called Titillitalic.\r\nAdded even more interesting, bendy characters\r\nto
  make it into something called Elbonium-Italic.\r\nThen slanted that back upright
  to make the Regular\r\nEbonium fonts.\r\n\r\nHope these pics show up okay...\r\n\r\n-chank\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Titillium_DerivedVersions_1110_6482.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Elbonium_fontlog_pic2_3989.gif]"

    and a few colors.\r\n\r\ni like this font because it's got handwriting letterforms
    more than typographic forms.\r\n\r\ni think it's looking pretty neat.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elbonium_pacific_island_destination_3599.jpg]"
