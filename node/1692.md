body: 'I know we&#39;ve been thru this a couple of times, but I&#39;m looking for
  a font utility, as it becomes clearer that FontBook will not work the way we like.
  Right now I&#39;m using a demo of Suitcase 11, and it works alright &#40;still miss
  ATM tough&#41;. But I haven&#39;t read anything about <a href="http://www.alsoft.com/MasterJuggler/index.html"
  target="_blank">Alsoft&#39;s Masterjuggler</a>, which seems to have a pretty neat
  interface. <BR>Does it have auto-activation?  <BR>Any experiences out there? '

  body: I have yet to give it a go myself, but there was some additional discussion
    regarding MasterJuggler on Typographica back in May and July. The second article
    is probably the mostly enlightening. <BR> <BR>&#149; <a href="http://typographi.ca/000605.php">MasterJuggler

    3 Released</a> <BR> <BR>And according to <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/13801.html">this
    recent thread</a> auto-activation is due in a future release.

  body: Like I&#39;ve said before, I&#39;ve used them all and MasterJuggler is the
    one I&#39;m sticking with. <BR> <BR>The best thing was that Alsoft honored my
    10 year old purchase of MasterJuggler &#40;for system 7&#41; and sold me a license
    for the upgrade price.
