  some Python snippet or something out there that allows you to preview your path

    body: Thanks! Anyone know if Robofont can preview a stroke? I've been looking
      into making that purchase.

  body: Maybe someone who works at Commercial Type can answer this directly, but I
    have to imagine Marian was either built in Glyphs or they had some special python
    code that allowed them to preview it. Hrant -- if you're implying, "Is this going
    to be just another form of Marian, a hairline spine/outline form of a classic
    typeface?" the answer to that is no. Hopefully it will see commercial release
    within the year, though.

    always closed automatically.\r\n\r\nWith some Python hacking skills you could
    probably make the Outliner plug-in to work better for this purpose."

  body: Thanks, Jason, Mark & Jens! Outliner looks like exactly the tool I'm looking
    for, and it's swaying more and more towards buying RoboFont.
