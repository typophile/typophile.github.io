<p>..and maybe more interestingly, what would you WANT to be the next big thing in typography?</p>
<p>Oh, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be related to any one specific aspect of typography either. It can be about technology, tools, specific design styles, printing techniques, etc. etc. Anything you can think of relating to the world of typography, really.</p>
<p>Looking forward to some interesting answers!</p>

<p>However, I have some strong feelings about what should be the last big thing. And principal amongst these is the total disregard / lack of acknowledgement for the skills of the typographer.</p>
<p>This comes from two desperate experiences:</p>
<p>i) When asked what I do for a living and answering &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a Typographer&rsquo;, being confronted with the reply &lsquo;What does that mean&rsquo; or worse, &lsquo;so you do DTP&rsquo;&hellip; jeez&hellip;</p>
<p>ii) Overhearing two 16 year-old chav secretaries debating whether Times New Roman or Verdana was the &lsquo;better looking&rsquo; font.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;d had a length of rope, I&rsquo;d have hanged them. Or, if they were too quick for me, I&rsquo;d have hanged myself&hellip; :-)</p>

<p>personally, to answer my own question, i&rsquo;d like to see typefaces, particularly ones for text, becoming more random in that each letter might have a handful of small variations, and when you use it it&rsquo;ll randomize it and make the text feel more alive, like it did with the older manual printing techniques. it used to be more imperfect, but that&rsquo;s also what made it much more alive. i know the technology is getting there with randomization of letters, but as far as i know there aren&rsquo;t any typefaces (or programs) that have this.. it may not be the perfect solution to making the printed letter feel more living, but at least it&rsquo;d be a step towards the right direction.</p>

<p>true, this kind of thing is more desireable in script fonts moreso than text fonts. However, when I was putting together <a href="http://p22.com/products/Franklin.html">Franklin Caslon</a>, I put together a quick font that although not really random simulated this kind of effect. (althought i&rsquo;m sure i could make it more random with a bit more work). Here&rsquo;s a screen grab just for fun with some text set out of the box with my beta font.

<p>your image looks similar to what i was thinking about, although naturally the typefaces wouldn&rsquo;t have to look as well-used as your sample image does.. but yes, that&rsquo;s similar to what i was thinking. if some printers/punch-cutters had a dozen variations on many letters back then, and those printings are considered superior to what&rsquo;s done today then maybe having fonts with slightly varied letters through a randomizing function would be a way to try and emulate it.</p>
<p>how did you make that anyway? i thought it wasn&rsquo;t really possible to make Opentype fonts randomize (or rather, it&rsquo;s possible, just not supported)..?</p>

<p>BBC4 makes quirky version of Buzzcocks
Geoff White
21 March 2006 09:08</p>
<p>BBC4 is making its answer to Never Mind The Buzzcocks - a highbrow panel show based on spelling and grammatical mistakes called Never Mind The Full Stops.</p>
<p>Presented by Julian Fellowes, each week the quiz show will feature four celebrity wordsmiths looking at the quirks of the English language, with rounds on bad grammar and bad spelling.</p>
<p>Fellowes starred in BBC1&rsquo;s long-running drama Monarch of the Glen and recently presented Julian Fellowes Investigates: A Most Mysterious Murder for BBC1.He also wrote the screenplay to feature film Gosford Park, for which he won an Oscar, and wrote the best-selling novel Snobs.</p>
<p>Commissioned by BBC entertainment commissioning controller Jon Beazley and executive editor for comedy entertainment Katie Taylor, the 10 x 30-minute series is due for broadcast in May. It is produced by Jo Street.</p>
<p>Never Mind The Buzzcocks is a BBC2 show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;with OpenType, and with some sophisticated linguistic analysis, a  font could very well ramp up readability by intelligently varying glyphs depending on context.&rdquo; (from another discussion)</p>
<p>I could see that being a genuinely novel <em>and</em> feasible movement forward. Something like &ldquo;contextual&rdquo; adjustments to glyph shape, kerning, letterspacing, etc., to the point that, say, whole words or phrases could be helped into line &ldquo;just so.&rdquo; Not to &ldquo;automate&rdquo; the art of the typographer, but to help and to open up possibilities (that&rsquo;s what technology is for, right?).</p>
<p>In any case, hasn&rsquo;t the whole &ldquo;randomness&rdquo; thing been done? I forget the specifics (ain&rsquo;t that the truth), but I recall a burst of enthusiasm for fonts that packed in some kind of algorithm that would cause the typesetting apparatus to produce randomly-varied letters.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s learn from others' mistakes&ndash; such as the &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; typefaces that fused two or more fonts into a &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; or &ldquo;pastiche&rdquo; (a favorite word of 1990s pomo theory). Nice theory, hideous type. Please no more of that.</p>

<p>the link in my previous post points to a thread that explains more on this. here&rsquo;s the link in case you missed it:
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/17177">http://typophile.com/node/17177</a>
but the short answer is code hacking.</p>
<p><em>if some printers/punch-cutters had a dozen variations on many letters back then&hellip;</em></p>
<p>believe it or not, but type design is quite time consuming. even designing a handful of alternates for each character may be more tedium than most designers want to deal with. and then start mutliplying alternates with smallcaps, extended language support, typographic niceties and you quickly get an infinate range of possiblities that is easy to get lost in. I know i for one am not ready for that yet.</p>
<p>to answer your initial question. my hope is that general pc (used in the personal computer sense not pc vs mac sense) users become more typographically aware once more programs begin to offer opentype support. but i&rsquo;m afraid this is just a dream&hellip;</p>

<p>oh, i know it takes time having dabbled with fontmaking (though never really on the pro level). i don&rsquo;t really mean that the additional variations would have to be completely new letterforms though.. it could be simpler variations, smaller ones. just little differences that might make the printed word look more living.</p>
<p>speaking of code hacking and randomizing, i&rsquo;m completely lost on that part.. i.e. i really need to learn Opentype. there just don&rsquo;t seem to be any good books (or websites) available for the completely newbie who knows absolutely nothing.. or at least i haven&rsquo;t found any.</p>
<p>anyway, thanks for the good replies!</p>

There are three separate Helvetica families: Helvetica, Neue Helvetica, and the newer, smaller (just four fonts) Helvetica World. Helvetica World is good display family for global companies, as it has an enormous character set.</p>
<p>Both Helvetica and Neue Helvetica allow users to mix and match weights, widths, and styles in a way that few other families allow. Of course there are other alternatives, but Helvetica has built up such worldwide recognition and respect that there will always be jobs for which it is suitable.</p>
<p>It is the best typeface for every application? Absolutely not! No typeface can or should be all things for all people. But Helvetica is one of the biggest success stories in the history of typography. If it didn&rsquo;t have its own stylistic advantages, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get so big.</p>

<p>Helvetica and Univers may have been alone in these capacities when they first appeared. But I think that many of the typefaces done for newspapers and magazines now have these capacities. Look at the catalogues of Font Bureau and Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones&ndash;leading suppliers of these fonts&ndash;for many, many examples. The Fontfont catalogue has many also, like Meta.</p>
<p>When you say &lsquo;multi-purpose&rsquo; are you saying that Helvetica is a good text font for extended text in small sizes in print? I really don&rsquo;t think it is. Where did I read that Paul Rand told an employee of his not to set text in Helvetica? When the employee asked &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Because it looks like dog sh*t in text.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I know I have repeated too many times that the combination of wide counters and tight spacing hurts readablility, but I haven&rsquo;t seen any counter-examples yet.</p>

<p>No. There are multiple uses for typefaces in typography. Setting long, extended tracks of text is just one of the application for fonts. There are better typefaces for that than Helvetica. I think that that is pretty clear.</p>

<p>One more thought from a different view point: I personally have found that with the hobbies I have, once I start taking money for doing something, it takes a lot of the fun out if it, and puts more pressure on me. For free I can simply do my best and the people have got their money&rsquo;s worth. I am flute player (with electronic effects) and play for the fun of it. But I am able to fool people into thinking I am pretty good. And was recently making $8,000 a year playing a couple nights a week (coincidentally this was about the last time I could regularly afford to buy fonts). But I noticed that I was never satisfied with how I did, whereas <em>before</em> money was involved I&rsquo;d do just as well and think: Yeah! That was fun!</p>
<p>But when I play for free there are musicians that get mad at me for taking the job away from a &ldquo;pro&rdquo; musician. Fact is I have never seen another musician do what I do anyway. Should I never get to do what I love to do because I don&rsquo;t want money for it?</p>
<p>Same thing happens when someone asks me to help them with a graphics kind of thing. I am never satisfied and fiddle with it for so long there is no way anyone could possibly pay me for my time.</p>
<p>Perhaps if I felt I knew what I was doing, it would help, but I am almost always winging it. It is, perhaps, the story of my life.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;can someone explain to me what is wrong with stock photography? I am not in the biz, so it seems like a strange thing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am glad someone said it. Reading through this thread I see some asking for typographers and type designers to be recognised as quality professionals and asking for more money and yet supporting the use of stock houses.
What is wrong with stock photography?</p>
<p>Perhaps the following article written by world respected illustrator Brad Holland can answer that question better than I can.</p>
<p>Give Us Your Work and We&rsquo;ll Take Your Clients
by Brad Holland</p>
<p>The Gospel according to stock is that the bulk of stock house business comes from sales to clients who have previously used photography. There’s no proof for this. We’re supposed to take their word for it. But it’s crucial to the stockman that illustrators believe it. We all know they’re getting clients from somewhere. And if they’re not taking them from photographers, they’re taking them from us. That’s why they claim they’re &ldquo;expanding&rdquo; the market for illustration. How many of us would pay them to take pictures on consignment if they said, &ldquo;Give us your work and we&rsquo;ll take your clients?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But read an interview published in the September 1997 issue of Photo District News. There, you’ll get a frank explanation of how a stockman works. In it, the CEO of a major stock photo house explains how they successfully lured clients away from freelancers. According to Henry Scanlon of the Comstock photo agency, their &ldquo;goal&rdquo; was to convince art directors to use stock for commercial assignments. To do this they had to persuade them to call the stock house instead of photographers when they needed work.</p>
<p>Using direct mail, they &ldquo;hammered away at the market.&rdquo; They flooded clients with catalogues. And, &ldquo;after a long struggle,&rdquo; they created a &ldquo;position&rdquo; for stock that, he frankly admits, &ldquo;decimated&rdquo; the ranks of assignment photographers.</p>
<p>This particular CEO can afford to be blunt now. He’s branched out from stock into clip photos. And like other clip art sellers, he knows he’s no longer dependent on photographers. A clip-art-man, he says, will &ldquo;have no trouble&rdquo; finding hungry photographers willing to &ldquo;flood the market with cliches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what about the photographers he lured out of assignment work?
Well, now he can say it: They were hacks, &ldquo;mere technicians,&rdquo; in his words, willing to do nothing more than copy the work of other photographers. And just as stock &ldquo;decimated&rdquo; assignment photography, now royalty free photos will &ldquo;decimate&rdquo; them. 
As for stock photographers, he suggests they &ldquo;go to night school&rdquo; and find a new line of work. And good riddance, too. Disposing of the hacks, he says, will open up room at the top for &ldquo;real photographers&rdquo;. The stockman sees himself as a cat that is ridding the house of mice.
The stockmeisters of illustration will say this happened in stock photography. They’ll say it won’t happen here. You’re welcome to believe them if you like. But can you doubt they’re following a similar strategy?</p>
<p>If stock illustration houses &ldquo;decimate&rdquo; the ranks of artists, it will surely leave room at the top for &ldquo;real illustrators.&rdquo; Those with superior talent, and resourcefulness and those who enjoy name recognition will no doubt continue as elite craftsmen. But what business can consider itself healthy that has room at the top for only a handful of well-paid professionals and room at the bottom for a gypsy workforce of grunt laborers, desperate enough to do whatever work a stockman doles out.</p>
<p>We can’t presume to read the minds of the stock merchants who are now soliciting work from artists. We can’t know how sincere they are when they contact you to say that they’ve been following your career and they think you’re ready for stock. Credit them, if you like, with the best of intentions. But remember that when you give a stock house your pictures, you give them your clients. And there’s nothing in the contract you sign that says they ever have to give your clients back.</p>
