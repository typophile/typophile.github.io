  \u2013 dangerous curves!</strong>\r\n\r\nDesigned by Octavio Pardo, [[http://www.rosettatype.com/Sutturah|Sutturah]]
  is a display font intended for poster and editorial design. It was born as an exploration
  of new text patterns. The font combines very detailed and constructed shapes with
  script flavour. The design has varied influences, from gothic fraktur to the display
  super black high contrasted wood types. \r\n \r\n[[http://www.rosettatype.com/Sutturah|Sutturah]]
  is informal and irreverent. Its strong character goes beyond letter shape construction
  conventions; it quickly catches the eye and surprises the reader. Its personality
  allows for the creation of stunning pieces of design without the need of any other
  elements\u2026 a single word in [[http://www.rosettatype.com/Sutturah|Sutturah]]
  is worth a thousand images. Extra ligatures and swashes give the user even more
  possibilities and add to the fun of using [[http://www.rosettatype.com/Sutturah|Sutturah]]!\r\n\r\nSee
