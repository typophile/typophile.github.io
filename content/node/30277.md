    to non-EU citizens?

  body: James, it doesn't say anything about non-EU citizens but it looks to me like
    it's for students/schools only. I'll have another look.

  body: "I'm sorry, I should have looked into the official competition rules before
    posting but I didn't have the time. The rules say that are eligible for participation:\r\n\r\n\"schools
    of art, of graphic design, communication design, visual\r\ncommunication, media
    design or similar disciplines\" (my translation)\r\n\r\nit doesn't say anything
    about nationality: maybe you could write to redazione.polcom@politichecomunitarie.it
    to ask. As a general rule, no official contest can exclude EU citizens, but I'm
    not sure this applies here.\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry if I made you lose some time -
    but I really was excited at the possibility to have a professionally designed
    logo...\r\n\r\nbye C"

  body: Carlo, would you please explain to us what your agency actually does? The
    description in the contest rules is rather vague.

      of Ministers, so it's a part of the Government system. \r\n\r\nIt oversees the
      EU policy process, both in the policy definition phase and in the implementation
      of the EU rules in Italy. I know it's fairly complicated, so please feel free
      to ask any more information you need."
