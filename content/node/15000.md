  you guys could help me identify some of them.\r\n\r\nThe font used for \"Orion\"
  below:\r\nhttp://www.neko-machi.com/misc/ddr/orion78.jpg\r\n\r\nThe font used for
  \"Sounds\" below:\r\nhttp://img356.imageshack.us/img356/3904/untitled1copy1nf.jpg\r\n\r\n...and
  lastly, the font used for the partial set below.  I know it's not the greatest example
  (stroke + drop shadow has been added) but I know this font is pretty distinct...I
  just can't seem to put my finger on it.\r\nhttp://img356.imageshack.us/img356/4867/texts7ss.gif\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    target"new">DustBust</a> font, Sounds is [[Alessandro Butti]] and [[Aldo Novarese]]'s
    ubiquitous Microgramma/Eurostile Extended, and your partial set is Antique Olive.

    body: "Hi, thanks for the help.\r\n\r\nOne thing though--I'm pretty sure the last
      one isn't Antique Olive--I used to own the font used in that picture until I
      lost it in a hard drive crash, and I'm certain that wasn't it.  Are there any
      fonts that look very similar to that?"

    sure it's Antique Olive Compact indeed, Scott. ;-) Sorry for not linking right

      though--I could still swear the names don''t match up. *shrug* Thanks once again

    [[Bitstream]]'s <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=BT.107663.0.0\"
    target\"new\">Incised 901</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd it's a tad difficult to tell for sure,
    yet I think it might be the Nord weight, Paul."

    I looked through the Dustbust fonts, and while there were some really nice ones
    I hadn't seen before, none quite fit the bill :) I can post numerous other examples
    if neccesary; I've been chasing this font literally for years."
