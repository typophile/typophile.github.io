body: "I am looking for some publication quality fonts to suggest to my publisher.
  The text includes Hebrew (unpointed), polytonic Greek, and the usual diacritics
  used for Hebrew (underdots, hamza, ayin etc.) These are all available in the extended
  unicode (such as, for instance, TNR on Vista machines--not XP). Can anyone suggest
  either a single font or a combination of fonts (faces) that i could suggest to the
  designers of the book.\r\nThanks\r\nProf. Daniel Boyarin"

  body: "Although I cannot recommend specific typefaces, I would like to put forth
    the recommendation that you abandon the search for a single font for this purpuse,
    and instead explore a combination of fonts. When dealing with unrelated scripts,
    my experience is that they are best implemented through the use of separate fonts,
    as opposed to an amalgamated font. Simpler things tend to work better, and as
    expected. And, from a pure design perspective, separate fonts will give you better
    results for each script.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior Computer Scientist, CJKV

  body: "I think Prof. Boyarin is asking about eg. the underdot h, to indicate a chet
    sound, etc. for latin text, and compatible fonts for other scripts.\r\n\r\nFirst
    Adobe's Garamond Premier is a rare (unique?) font in having matching Polytonic
    Greek.   \r\n\r\nFor a project I have done, I needed to use the underdot h for
    Hebrew, and it was not present in an otherwise very complete Adobe font. At John
    Hudson's recommendation I made a separate modified font, with the underdot h in
    it, and substituted that where needed as I input the text. The glottal stops for
    the ayin and alef (not called hamza, that's Arabic) are often indicated with single
    quotes one way around and the other. Personally I better like transliteration
    rules where these are put in only when absolutely necessary to indicate pronunciation,
    and not routinely. But this gets into the Hebrew transliteration issue, which
    is a can of worms. \r\n\r\nI might add that a lot of success in harmonizing different
    scripts lies in the way the page is designed, and not only the fonts. "

  body: A few other good text faces that include polytonic Greek integrated with the
    Latin design are Adobe Arno Pro, Adobe Minion Pro, and ShinnType Scotch Modern.
    Gentium and Palatino Linotype also have polytonic Greek, but aren't quite as suitable
    for use as book faces. Scotch Modern and Gentium also contain the underdot diacritics
    and glottals for Semitic transliteration.
