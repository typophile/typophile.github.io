    the strange v's serif) must be the result of either a bad designer's choice or
    a quick unedited raster-to-vector conversion.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nI found

  body: "Thank you very much. At first sight I thought you can't be right, but after
    a second look: The left side of the bar of the \"t\", the rather short \"d\" and
    \"b\", the proportions of the upper-case \"B\", the shape of \"a\" and \"r\",
    that's all *very* similar. I haven't found a hint that there's a \"rough\" version
    of New York, so probably it's custom made for the CD cover for Handel's \"Alcina\",
    an opera about a sorceress turning men into animals. Probably the modifications
    of the font are thought to mirror the opera's archaic and \"wild\" plot...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01_5215.jpg]\r\nNo
    wonder I had no success when I searched for fonts similar to Caslon Antique or
    Manuscript...\r\nThanks again!"

  body: Thank you, Ryuk. IM Fell Double Pica comes quite close, doesn't it? The lower-case
    "b" has a similar spur, the "t" is similar as well. And IM Fell English and Great
    Primer have a similar roughness. Still, it's strange that this one should be so
    difficult to identify.
