body: "So, I'm starting a redesign of a boutique winery logotype, which was quickly
  thrown together years ago in Word using Kuenstler Script, and some Times New Roman
  (Windows default fonts). \r\n\r\nThe label looks terribly generic, but I'm thinking
  to refine the type overall and give the composition a designer's touch because the
  winery has some brand equity in the design.\r\n\r\nIf the timeline wasn't so crazy,
  I would really like to hire out the script to a calligrapher to get a totally custom
  and ownable logotype, I don't think I know enough about scripts to do it myself
  from scratch. I need some suggestions of types that look similar to Kuenstler, but
  are more unique and boutique than the Windows-installed font. I'm familiar with
  Shelley and Novia from other threads...\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?"

  body: Or you could try the wonderful <strong>[[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000329|Memoir]]</strong>
    by Stephen Rapp. The script has quite nice natural touch and lots of alternates,
    and would look wonderful on a wine label.

  body: "thanks everybody! Epixs, your stuff is really nice, if we had more time,
    I'd consider sourcing the script out. The logotype needs to be very close to their
    existing, but with a little more character. I'm really liking Burgues Script for
    the alternates and will probably go with that, Shelley is pretty close as well.\r\n\r\nGenerally
    speaking, are there 'rules' with how you should design flourishes and connect
    letters? It seems like calligraphic lettering is more an art and there aren't
    necessarily hard/fast rules or a 'correct' way of going about rendering a word.
    I have a great Doyald Young book at home that I'll consult, are there any other
    resources I should refer to when tackling this logotype?"
