body: " This typeface was used for a letterhead by a local (Massachusetts) printer
  in the early 1970's. It was said to have been similar to a typeface seen in Avant
  Garde magazine. The printer is still in business but the current personnel do not
  know the source. I suspect it is a phototype typeface that has not been digitized.
  I have not been able to search PLINC catalogs yet and have not found it on the various
  online sources or in the few standard references that I have been able to check.
  What is very distinctive about this typeface beyond the delicate, condensed spacing
  is the narrow uppercase \"A\" with relatively high crossbar, the narrow, straight
  lowercase \"t\", the absence of a spur on the lowercase \"u\" and how the circular
  parts of the lower case \"p\". \"a\" and \"d\" just barely touch the vertical parts
  of these letters. We have an additional sample of this typeface with a few more
  letters not shown in the image given here. If anyone has a name or source for this
  typeface, we would be much obliged. Otherwise we will attempt to recreate a digital
  version with some font software that we have.\r\n Thanks much,\r\n Ray\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MysteryFont_4292.jpg]"

  body: "It has more of a look of Futura than Avant Garde to me but I can't find a
    Futura that is that thin. The A doesn't match Futura either.\r\n\r\nThe tight
    spacing probably has nothing to do with the font, more the tracking."

    version.

  body: "In Futura the uppercase \"A\" is wider, the circular part of the lowercase
    \"a\", \"d\" and \"p\" has much greater contact with the vertical stroke than
    in this typeface, and the dot of the lowercase \"i\" is higher than the top of
    the lower case \"t\". There are lots of similar typefaces out there that seem
    to be variations of this simple, geometric construction, of which this seems to
    be one of the purest and to me most elegant. The recent Stylor JNL and the common
    Century Gothic are two that share many traits. You are correct that the spacing
    between letters is probably just an artifact of the typesetting. In my sample
    the lowercase \"p\" and \"e\" are actually touching in the letterhead.\r\n Ray"
