  body: "I'd be extremely surprised if the logo for classic Danish record company

    not impossible to reporduce with 1983 font technology, but I'd still wager good
    money on it being made by hand.\r\n\r\nOne good indicator of this is that the
    original logo was slimmer and slightly different:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://cdn.discogs.com/QRHCJ1mufHSoj50AmPMknkCw3NA=/fit-in/180x180/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb()/discogs-images/L-2061-001.gif.jpg\">"
