  making a decision. What do you think about these logos? It's for a snowboard company
  who is also selling downhill skateboard. I want to make two logos, one with the
  all \"Pumpkin\" word and another small one as a symbol. \r\n\r\nAny kind of critics
  are welcome...\r\n"

    a little safe.\r\n\r\nAlso does anyone else read 'PLIMPKIN'? Maybe look at making
    the U a little more rounded and having more space between the U and the M.\r\n\r\nHope
    that helps"

  body: "Thanks for your critic... I read Pumpkin easily, but yeah maybe more space
    will help.  The choice is hard between the straight and the rounded edges one
    (1 and 3). \r\n\r\nI really like number 2 and I'm trying to make the white and
    black holes look better. For example the inside of the \"P\" and the black on
    top of the intersection of \"P\" and \"K\"."

    screams skateboarding - more slick mountainering gear.\r\nI have no plimpkin problems
    and am leaning towards no.1 in a no.1 or no.3 choise.\r\n\r\nWill"

    pumpkin-like. It probably doesn't really matter but I find the very sharp pointed
    angles disconcerting with the name pumpkin. However, that may be the point. \r\nAnd
    I read pumpkin not plimpkin."

  body: 'I think the rounded edges of  #3 work best for the reasons kirsten mentioned.
    i also think the border should be thicker, as it is in #1, for similar reasons.
    and yes a little tracking the letters apart will help with legibility, and thankfully
    gets rid of that connection between the lower leg of the K and the I that we see
    in #1.'

  body: "Thanks all of you for your comments. About that project: I'm studying Graphic
    Design in Brussels and this is my final project. I'm going to do their new identity,
    website, packaging, boards graphics... the all thing.\r\n\r\nYou can check their
    two website here: \r\nhttp://www.cloud-9.ch/schneebretter/index.html\r\nhttp://www.cloud-9.ch/rollbretter/index.html\r\n\r\nCurrently
    they have two logos for one brand and I think one logo for the all \"Pumpkin\"
    brand suits better. About what Will said, I'm aware of that but their skateboards
    are slalom and downhill skateboards, often used on mountains and hills. I tried
    to put skate and snow in one logo (#2).\r\n\r\nI like the rounded one too, but
    it doesn't really fit when I'm using it as the symbol \"PK\" #3. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pk_4594.png]"

    the shape of the board ? I haven''t tried it, but I think it might work and it
    will be along the lines of the option #3.'

  body: 'I understand your concern about the rounded corners paired with the sharp
    angles of your icon. (although the contrast between the two doesn''t bother me
    so much) You may want to re-think your symbol. A mountain range would be good
    for ski/snowboard manufacturer but for a Skateboard/snowboard manufacturer? Looks
    like you are ignoring half of the clientele. after Re-reading your original post
    stating you want 2 designs, a word mark and a symbol. I''m wondering are they
    going to be used for the different products? And while I like the look of the
    mark, it''s starting to bother me the more I think about it, why PK? Does anyone
    abbreviate pumpkin PK? '

  body: "Hey Kirsten, thanks for your comment, it's always good to get different opinion.\r\n\r\nI
    understand what you mean with the skate/snow manufacturer, and I'm aware of that.
    But as I said above, those skateboards are often used for speed and downhill.
    Those guys wear leather and helmet riding down mountains at incredible speed...
    That's why I think the mountain symbol isn't far from that kind of skateboarding.
    \r\n\r\nI'm still thinking about that option because as you said I don't want
    to ignore half of the clientele. And it's true not everybody rides skateboards
    in mountains.\r\n\r\nI'm still in the early process of the logo so I'm trying
    things, that's why I came up with that PK. Maybe I could try to use the whole
    Pumpkin word and the mountain symbol without the PK. I know PK is not the abbreviation
    of Pumpkin, it's just an option to make a symbol out of the brand. \r\n\r\n@epsilicon
    \r\nDo you mean I should make the P and the N look like skateboard or snowboard
    edges?"

  body: Yes, round the two left corners of P and two right corners of N. Just to see
    if it works at all, there might be something in this.

  body: "^spam?\r\n\r\nI don't think there will be a lot of people on this board that
    can actually consider themselves in your target audience, however, I can.\r\n\r\nIt
    might be worth looking at other brands that are established in the (longboard)
    downhill community; Landyachtz, Rayne and Sector9 spring to mind.\r\n\r\nBut in
    this downhill community you can distinguish two different groups; those who do
    it for the fun of it, and those that do it professionally. I think the logo you
    currently have is better suited for the first group, the second one is a bit more
    'high tech', think 'nano-tube carbon-fiber'.\r\n\r\nIf you need the opinion of
    more people in the 'scene' try the forums of Silverfish Longboarding (the largest
    online community on longboarding).\r\n\r\nJust a heads up; Pumpkin is already
    a name in use for a type of bushings made by Bear (subdivision of Landyachtz)."
