    a font, but I think it has just enough quirk for my project.

  body: Interesting to see Eclat mentioned. I had dinner with its designer, <BR>Doyald
    Young, at TypeCon a few days ago, during which I asked <BR>why more of his beautiful
    letters and scripts aren&#39;t digitized. His <BR>main frustration &#40;and this
    shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise to anyone here&#41;  <BR>is that he sees his
    fonts used all the time but he rarely sees any  <BR>royalties. Perhaps [edited
    by TM] is one reason why.

  body: I have some familiarity with the work of the Eclat-lookalike font designer
    &#40;one more edit is needed to get rid of all the places it showed up, by the
    way&#41;. I&#39;d be a bit reluctant to accuse him of stealing Doyald&#39;s design,
    because I think they may both have used some old Art Deco -era books from the
    20&#39;s and 30&#39;s as their inspiration. Many of the other fonts that Mr. N.
    C. has done have been digitizations of other authentic typefaces from that era.
    In fact that time period, as we know, seems to be in vogue again, and many foundries
    have revivals of old typefaces.  <BR> <BR>Stephen, does Doyald say that the Eclat
    design is his original creation?

  body: I&#39;m with you Mike. I do know that the unnamed designer does <BR>draw most
    of his sources from older books. Eclat, though, is <BR>an exception as Doyald
    alluded that he drew it from scratch for <BR>photo type machines in the early
    &#39;80s. But I should go right to <BR>the source before I make any more assumptions.
    I&#39;ll ask him tonight.

  body: Stephen, the showing of <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?2OZ" target="_blank">Eclat
    at Identifont</a> says the design was &#39;Inspired by &#34;fat face&#34; designs
    of the early 19th century&#39;  &#40;I wonder if they meant 20th?&#41;. In any
    case that implies to me that it is not completely original, and it&#39;s possible
    that the other designer may have used the same sources.

  body: <i>Doyald Young asked me to post the following:</i> <BR> <BR>Eclat references
    sports scripts, the kind commonly seen for baseball teams. <BR> <BR>I did not
    draw from a model, remember I&#39;ve taught scripts to students at Art Center
    for 27 years. The style has been around for a hundred years or more though not
    in the same exact shapes - look in the Encyclopaedia of Types for a review of
    metal scripts. I saw the style with commercial possibilities, not a free style
    as in many casual or brush scripts, but formal, simple, and robust shapes - as
    bold as I could draw the forms while still holding legibility. Many of the sports
    scripts were drawn with scant finesse, and for commercial use, I thought that
    more attention to detail was needed.  <BR> <BR>Bold scripts can&#39;t lean much
    and heavy connecting strokes pose a problem, because the bolder their shape, the
    lower the join must be near the baseline, and this lessens readability. In my
    book <a href="http://delphipress.com/">Logotypes and Letterforms</a> I devote
    a double spread to its history of Eclat in the Scripts chapter. I show a logo,
    Shu Uemura that borrows some of these features whose thins are what I strived
    for. <BR> <BR>Eclat&#39;s joins were modified slightly from my art when Letraset
    cut the Rubyliths in 1985, ITC digitized it in 1992. Fonts with tight fit always
    pose problems. More alternate letters are needed, though when Letraset agreed
    to include the font in their library, their finished art cut-off date was tight
    and I didn&#39;t have time to add them. Also, in my book <a href="http://delphipress.com/">Fonts
    &amp; Logos</a> I show a bold, narrow script that I called &#39;Bold Condensed
    Script&#39; and now have renamed it &#39;Home Run Script.&#39; <BR> <BR>Plagiarism
    is a threat in all fields of design. It takes time and money to combat it. A Chicago
    foundry ripped off my ITC Young Baroque font, calling it Yves. Plagiarism lessens
    our design impulse, since the courts wont license a design, only the code, a bizarre
    ruling. And so it goes. Plagiarism and &#39;designed in the manner of&#39; are
    two different issues and type foundries have a history of doing the later. A cursory
    look at Frank Merriman&#39;s wonderful A Type Comparison Book illustrates the
    point. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not fond of the name Eclat, which means a dazzling effect,
    brilliance. It also is synonymous with fame. I preferred Elan, but that name was
    taken and Letraset offered Eclat, I couldn&#39;t think of a better name so I said
    yes.  <BR> <BR>I see Eclat used for food products; French&#39;s mustard uses it
    for the word &#39;Classic&#39; on the label, though they&#39;ve modified the cap
    C. A local Latino TV station here in Los Angeles boldly uses the font on the Metro
    Bus signs, Adobe has used it for their print ad headlines, and an Israeli airline
    has chosen it for their logo.
