  owners of a type foundry are interested in being interviewed for a professional
  profile in a text book I am writing, can they please send me an e-mail through Typophile
  or by sending an e-mail to: reid.anderson@durhamcollege.ca\r\n\r\nThe interview
  would take about an hour.\r\n\r\n<em> Hope to hear from some of you. "

    a few of you who could volunteer one hour. It could turn out to be a good way
    to publicize your work. Anyways, think about it. I am still looking.\r\n\r\nReid"

  body: "Reid, many owners of type foundries, especially larger ones, do not read
    every Typophile thread. I would suggest e-mailing them directly. The heads of
    Linotype, FontShop, E+F, URW++, TypeBox, Porchez Typofonderie, etc. all give interviews
    for publications on a regular basis, so I'm sure that they would respond favorably
    to your book if you would ask them.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
