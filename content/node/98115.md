  body: "I think \u2018Prosthetica\u2019 (amputated letter parts > prosthesis) was
    supposed to be joke. The letters of the logo, however, are a (worse) joke. If
    you want a working typeface with a similar feel, buy <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/\">Futura</a>."

  body: I'm guessing that means that the logo was edited in something like Photoshop
    then. I'm not a font expert, so can't expect me to get the joke. Thanks for your
    effort though.

  body: "Probably not Photoshop, but yes, they apparently used some software to either
    modify Futura or rather create the letters for the logo from scratch. It seems
    unlikely that there is an entire typeface; it\u2019s just these eight letters,
    I think. At least to me, the result looks amateurish and contrived. As I said,
    you might like Futura although I admit that it does not have this type of \u2018N\u2019,
    not to mention the quite unusual (and hard to read) \u2018R\u2019. And I\u2019m
    quite sensitive when it comes to this letter."

  body: 'Agree with R. Looks like a manipulated [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/futura-book/|Futura
    Demi]] (Demi and Paratype version to get a very close /S, /U, /O and /N with flat
    connections). The rest could have been redrawn: /B from /P with an additional
    bottom bowl (in Futura, /B top bowl is not identical to /P one), /R obviously
    with /P with a vertical stroke as leg, /N customized (moving vertical stroke left
    and removing the resulting external oblique stroke), /M and /A redrawn (or may
    be simply horizontally compressed?). Everything could be done using vector software
    like Illustrator or CorelDraw (type text, vectorize and simply edit moving strokes
    or points).'
