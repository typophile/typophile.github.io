body: "I'm typesetting a short A5 booklet which explains the ideology of a political
  party to a general audience.  Our budget allows us to get the cover professionally
  printed but not the inner pages, which we will be photocopying ourselves.  We'll
  also be producing a PDF version for online distribution.  I'm using LaTeX.\r\n\r\nThe
  booklet has been typeset in the Computer Modern family at 10pt, but this doesn't
  photocopy well as it's too thin.  I'd like suggestions on serif alternatives which
  are appropriate for this sort of subject matter and legible at 10pt when photocopied,
  as well as a matching heading typeface.  The standard PostScript typefaces would
  be easiest for us since LaTeX is already set up to work with them, but if there's
  a compelling reason to buy and install some proprietary fonts I'll consider them.\r\n\r\nFor
  example, would Palatino + Helvetica be suitable?  Or New Century Schoolbook for
  the text and something else for the headings?  (LaTeX pairs New Century Schoolbook
  with Avant Garde by default, but I'm not sure about the look of the latter.)\r\n\r\nHere's
  the actual pamphlet so far: <a href=\"http://www.nothingisreal.com/tmp/principes.pdf\"><em>Principes</em>
  in Computer Modern 10pt</a>.  (Ignore the layout and the four cover pages for now;
  I'm no professional book designer so I'm sure they're horrible, but I'll post a
  request for a critique later.)"

  body: "Yes, use almost anything except Computer Modern.  Ugh.  Avoid Avant Garde,
    too.\r\n\r\nThe classic PostScript faces don't pair very well, unless you really
    know what you're doing, typographically speaking.  I think it'd be better to use
    just one good face -- say, Palatino -- and come up with contrasting sizes & styles
    for heads.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, unless you're a LaTeX/TeX guru, you're still
    going to end up with something very text heavy and fairly gray on the page.  Maybe
    that's okay, but you mentioned \"general audience,\" and I think you're going
    to have a challenge getting everyday folks to read this all the way through.  I
    know, I know -- you didn't ask for input on layout.\r\n\r\n--John"
