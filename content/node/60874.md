  company based out of Petra, Jordan, but who receive a majority of their clients
  from Canada and the US.\r\n\r\n\r\nThought I would call on the type crowd to see
  what they might suggest.\r\n\r\n\r\nI appreciate any insight and thank-you in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO"

    It might give you some fresh ideas.\r\n\r\nI also seem to remember an Arabic-like

    are no inscriptions in \"Trajan\" style majuscules on the buildings, but that
    would presumably be the historically appropriate style of lettering.\r\n\r\n"
