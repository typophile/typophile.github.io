  ITC Blair, Engravers Gothic, or Trade Gothic Extended,  are an exact match (obvious
  in C and L I think) so I'd really appreciate your input.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_4x-horizontal_3981.jpg]"

    for Balenciaga. It is copyrighted to [[http://files.korkork.com|Anton Koovit]]
    and [[http://ybaggar.com|Yassin Baggar]] of [[http://www.fatype.com|Fatype]].
    They did some typefaces for GQ, Derzeit and Journal B. Attached, a printscreen
    of Bal10-Light as shown on Balanciaga website.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/balanciaga_4057.png]"

  body: OK, I see know some differences with Bal10. Overall design is close but some
    details remain off though. May be they simply started with Bal10 and created some
    kind of Bal10 Extended Bold version of it. Main logo is extended, /E middle bar
    is upper and shorter and /G middle bar is downer which actually are not hard to
    reproduce. Bests remain definitely Engravers Gothic Bold and Sackers Gothic Heavy.
    I'd probably start with Sackers (more balance than Engravers) and mainly make
    it bolder.

  body: Can't find a perfect match and really doubt there's one actually, commercially
    available speaking. As almost all the time for the fashion industry, they probably
    here too use bespoke typefaces which makes perfectly sense when your business
    tries to evoke luxury, uniqueness and fashion. This one is somehow similar to
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/engravers+gothic/|Engravers Gothic]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/blair/|Blair]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/sackers+gothic/|Sackers
    Gothic]], slightly wider. With some little alterations, you could do pretty much
    the same with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova|Proxima
    Nova MS]], [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview|Gotham HTF]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gautier/maax|Maax
    205]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/font-fabric/nexa|Nexa FFF]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/glen-jan/room|Room
    GJ]] or even [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/avenir|Avenir]] (more work here).

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nIf I may clarify this a little bit:\r\nThe logotype is a bespoke
    design created by Julien Gallico, the art director responsible for the new Balenciaga
    identity. We had no hand in it at all. He commissioned us to create a new typeface
    for this identity. While they certainly share a similar esthetic (that was the
    goal!), the logo and the typeface are not directly derived from each other. The
    typeface is a sort of spin-off (I'm not going to say custom since it often means
    quickly changing a few letters) of our typeface U8, which we transformed under
    his art direction.\r\n\r\nAs far as we know, the typeface has not been used very
    much yet. We expected it to be used for little prints on labels and things like
    that, the webfont was not planned (hence the rather poor rendering in your screenshot),
    but we are glad they embrace the design even for their website."
