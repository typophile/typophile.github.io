  body: 'We&#39;re working on the SOTA site right now, and it will be up next week
    with secure registration and more information. For now, I can tell you the fee
    structure: <BR> <BR>Full-time Student $25 <BR>Professional $60 <BR>Professional
    Plus $90 <BR>Sustaining $300&#43; <BR> <BR>Full breakdown of benefits will be
    listed on the site, and include a significant discount on TypeCon2003 admission,
    discounts on font purchases from participating foundries, no fees for TypeGallery
    submissions, membership in the SOTA discussion list, special invitations to events
    that SOTA co-sponsors, etc. <BR> <BR>We will be adding more benefits throughout
    the year. Since SOTA is a non-profit organization, a portion of the membership
    dues are tax-deductible for US citizens. Membership dues go toward SOTA&#39;s
    efforts to present more affordable educational programming, and our continued
    support of the type design community, developing publications, sponsoring other
    relevant events, and more. <BR> <BR>Come visit the site next Tuesday - you&#39;ll
    see much more. <a href="http://www.typesociety.org" target="_blank">www.typesociety.org</a>'

  body: Hi Tamye, everyone. <BR> <BR>When I came to TypeCon2002, I was under the impression
    the attendance fee came with a SoTA membership &#40;&#34;Admission includes a
    one year membership in SoTA&#34; as the form said&#41;. <BR> <BR>Does this apply?
    Have I still got 6 months of benefits left? Did I miss something?

  body: Hi, David. I&#39;ll clarify. SOTA membership is based on the calendar year,
    Jan. 1-Dec. 31. Since you went to TypeCon last year, in July, and SOTA membership
    was included with your registration, your membership was valid through Dec. 31,
    2002. It wasn&#39;t crystal clear on the conference registration form, and I apologize
    for that. <BR> <BR>We try to make the benefits so good, and the dues low enough,
    that if you join in the middle of the year, you will still get plenty out of your
    membership. If you join before TypeCon happens in the summer, a major perk is
    the 20% discount off conference registration fees for SOTA members... <BR> <BR>And
    being as you&#39;re outside North America, you&#39;re entitled to the Global Professional
    rate, which is a pretty great deal. <BR> <BR>I hope this makes more sense. Sorry
    for any confusion. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re welcome for the link <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Me too, but there are many organization using the solar or calendar year.
    Even my internet provider use this system and often it&#39;s annoying. Anyway,
    my internet provider actually charges you the months you use, and you only need
    to renew the contract in January. <BR>After my TDC subscription I gave up to any
    association, anyway. Being in Italy is not so close to important typographic events.
    <BR>And this year, with the AtypI in Rome, I wasn&#39;t so well... What a luck!

  body: Hrant and Claudio, your opinions are certainly valid. Please understand  that
    everyone involved with keeping SOTA going worked together to determine the best
    method. <BR> <BR>To help keep costs low and run the organization as efficiently
    as we can, the calendar year method works best for SOTA and its members over the
    long term. Another key factor in this decision is that TypeCon will not necessarily
    be held at the same time each year, so we cannot base the membership year on the
    &#34;right-before-a-conference&#34; method.
