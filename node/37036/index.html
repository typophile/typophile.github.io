Yes, but we don't need to be spreading the word for the pirates. Especially on a site where so many of our users are making some or all of their income creating the fonts that these guys are stealing.

With all respect to you Paul---aww give Dennis a break. Chiding him for his contribution is like making excuses for not putting your foot down when it counts. If typophile's moderators have any real guts at dealing with piracy, threads like this that link to pirated font sources would be simply be deleted without discussion.

There's nothing to discuss. Just get rid of it. There is no excuse for strealing fonts, and there is no excuse for not deleting posts by those who support it.

My point: be firm but fair. Trust everyone but cut the cards.

Is it because it will happen anyway and everyone who wants to pirate fonts already knows where to go. If not, I could make some suggestions on where to go.

The moderators here are fair to a fault in leaving posts up so that all sides of a discussion can be heard. Editing direct links and reminding a poster not to do such a thing is probably the fairest thing that could be done.

Okay, fair enuff. I just happen to think that discussion of font piracy usually goes in circles, altho this one has proven an exception.

Tiffany, I appreciate your rationale---the practical reason for leaving these threads as reference points. Thanks for explaining.

<em>Oh, and I don’t apologize for removing links, I just remove them.</em>

Perfect. There's nothing to apologize for.

My apologies to Paul---you did right.

Actually, everyone doesn't know. People wonder, but not everyone knows where to go unless they start wasting a lot of time searching. Let's make it just a bit harder to pirate for both the experts and the naifs, shall we?</div>
