    reduced their US price from $24 to $18 per issue.  <BR>Still pricey, but better.

  body: there&#39;s this magazine, grafik, coming out of the uk which is pretty rad.  i
    think it&#39;s graphic design and type, so it&#39;s similar to what baseline or
    eye would cover.   <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.grafikmagazine.co.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.grafikmagazine.co.uk/</a>

  body: I don&#39;t mean to rain on the grafik parade, but to me it is like the other
    &#34;trendy&#34; fashion/design mags like IdN and such. Baseline is excellent,
    it is an absolutely beautiful piece of work, a thing of beauty. You could also
    try Emigre if you like American pro-active design/type theory and critique.  <BR>

  body: BTW, weeks ago I found in a second hand book store an issue of the old Typographica
    magazine with a nice Walter Tracy&#39;s article about phone directories. Pages
    of about 12 different phone books are included en compared. Great!

  body: 'Baseline: the price reduction is strange, because for years I&#39;ve seen
    it on the stands for between 18 and 20 dollars... BTW, I&#39;ll be selling my
    entire collection &#40;almost 30 issues, some extremely rare - almost all in mint
    condition&#41; on eBay soon. It certainly was and is a great magazine, but I let
    my subscription lapse, and don&#39;t want to be stuck with a partial collection.
    My reserve price won&#39;t be too low, so start saving up, or get a rich spouse/mate
    to buy it for you for xmas or something...  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Ramiro, yes, that
    was an amazing article! <BR> <BR>hhp'
