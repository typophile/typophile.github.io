		<div class="commentbody">All of these are good points. Early offers paid smaller percentages, ITC for instance, but in that case we got a &quot;most favourable up front signing fee&quot;, they did all the work. ITC made a big event of a new releases. This was not exclusive. We released our own version of the same title, same artwork. <BR> <BR>The other option would have been to sub-license the font back. <BR> <BR>Another company paid $5000.00 up front. Another $20,000 but they only paid a &quot;dime&quot; (their verbiage) per font. However they guaranteed 200,000 fonts would be sold. Add that up, pretty good deal.  <BR> <BR>These were strictly signing fees and were never subtracted from royalties. Only one of them was exclusive. <BR> <BR>My thoughts are that resellers are a &quot;thing&quot; soon to be of the past. Either that, or the type designers. How can a type designer make a living from 25%, giving an exclusive, with no guarantee? <BR> <BR>Risky business, no stupid. <BR></div>

Some of which have been common currency in North American trade markets for 100 years. We are speaking of market proven products. People buy them. Believe me. <BR> <BR>I suppose the only thing that might be said about our fonts in their present state is they are preparing themselves for OpenType. In addition I more aware of the subtle aspects of European accents. Especially Scandinavian accents. So some of these issues are getting addressed. These are improvements under way. That said, the accent issue is nothing many American foundries should be proud of. <BR> <BR>And please, remember I am against OpenType so don't tell anyone what we are doing. OK.</div>

He's <BR>probably still weary from the change to digital typography and I  <BR>don't blame him. Fortunately, like John just said, the OT shift is  <BR>many times simpler and I think Gerald would be pleased with  <BR>what it can do for his typefaces.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, <BR> <BR>Look I agree, eight hours is not long. But when you spend eight hours for 90 days re-working your library you would be inclined to think otherwise. <BR> <BR>Why bother propping up the underpinnings of monolithic corporations and their crippled applications that can't handle the real basics of type in the first place. For instance, rubber type, what's that all about? These programs were planned by strippers and photo comp folk, not by people that really knew anything about type. <BR> <BR>Besides, how long do your think the customer will say, gee look at this, I have magic ligatures? Not long. They will just take it all for granted. For that matter, these trained fonts, with their nifty gimmicks will make redundant highly skilled typesetters. Now, wait just a minute, where have they gone now? <BR> <BR>It further erodes the already over stressed economics of type design by increasing their work load without compensation. In the end type designers will all be eating out of dumpsters. <BR> <BR>You hear people saying, &quot;save the farmers,&quot; &quot;save the fisherman&quot;. When do you expect a public outcry of &quot;save the type designer&quot;. Never, that's when, never. <BR> <BR>What happened to photographers after all those &quot;stock art photographs&quot; drove them into poverty. Next time you walk down the street and tell me what you see, bums, winos,  your future before you if you make OpenType fonts. <BR> <BR>Don't you care about your children. Your self respect?  <BR> <BR>Your wine decisions will be made by how many beer bottles you find. <BR> <BR>Here we are all busy working ourselves out of employment, already the children of photographers and typesetters are suffering from malnutrition, teeth rotting, living with street rats. Think about it. <BR> <BR>But, oh no, we are going to work even harder to reduce the already few jobs to be found for our fellow workers. <BR> <BR>That's it, lets unionize. <BR> <BR>By the way, can I stay at your house tonight? <BR></div>
