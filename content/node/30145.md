  printing) and this reminded me of a lovely bit of description that I'd like share
  with you all. My wish here is that you not only look at it -- if you have the time,
  please read what is said about Bell.\r\n\r\nMaine printer Fred Anthoensen ran a
  scholarly book printing establishment in Portland from the 1920s until his death
  in the 1960s. (I recently mentioned him in the thread about ornaments.) Fred adored
  Bell type and in the 1920s, on a trip to England, he bought 500 pounds of it from
  Stephenson Blake, cast from the original matrices. Fred used it throughout his career
  at the Anthoensen Press, and everyone took such good care of it, we were still using
  it in the 1980s!\r\n\r\nThis little book was produced in 1939 as a keepsake for
  the Press. The text was originally an article for \"The New England Printer,\" November
  1935. As far as I know, Fred wrote only this piece, and then his great (autobiographical)
  work \"Types and Bookmaking\" in the 1940s. Reading this Bell piece has always made
  me wish he'd found time to write more -- I think he is flat-out marvelous. \r\n\r\nHope
  you guys enjoy it. The artwork at the top of page 3 was made by Charles R. Capon,
  the Boston-area calligrapher, illustrator and bookplate artist, who often collaborated
  with Fred. (The first scan is the opening page of the text, the second shows the
  title page spread.)"
