    approximate 'TUIGA' with some [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/din|DIN]] ([[http://www.myfonts.com/search/din+condensed|Condensed]])/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Trade+Gothic|Trade
    Gothic]] mainly reducing /G crossbar (and adding a spur for DIN).\r\n/C is more
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]] to me. And /M... Well... It looks
    like a complete failure to me :D"
