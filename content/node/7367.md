  <BR>Question: <BR>Let&#39;s say you paint a grayscale bitmap font in BitFonter2,
  and save it out as a pixelfont - exactly what comes out? Assuming that operation
  is even allowed, what do the resultant outlines look like? <BR> <BR>hhp'

    &#40;color to b&amp;w conversion&#41; operation being performed before tracing
    pixels like in the &#34;Export to FL&#34; operation. <BR> <BR>Johnych
