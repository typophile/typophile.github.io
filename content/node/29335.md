  that expressed an interest in using the paper that COLORS magazine currently uses,
  and we have tracked it down to its source in Finland, but will not be able to obtain
  it for a variety of reasons related primarily to distribution.\r\n\r\nSo my question
  is can anyone recommend an alternative with a similar tactile quality or point me
  in the right direction?\r\n\r\nEverything we've looked at so far is a little too
  fine and we really like the somewhat \"cheap\", toothy feel.\r\n\r\nThanks for any
  help you can offer.\r\n"

    body: "It is called UPM Fine from UPM-Kymmene (Finland) and is a publication grade
      that they sell directly to web printing publication houses.  Apparently it is
      not  really sold through US west coast merchants at all and is not a sheetfed
      item.  Word is they do sell sheets of this in Finland and other places in Europe.\r\n
      \r\nThe specifications on this are that it is a wood-free machine finished uncoated
      pub stock.\r\n"
