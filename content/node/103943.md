    that has been opened up.

  body: "Well, I admit it's impossible to be sure. But note the following:\r\n- That's
    actually what a -simplified- curve/curve trap looks like. It's an approach favored
    by some people (including Carter AFAICT) even for straight/straight traps, for
    its simple elegance.\r\n- Many people put shears at the ends of their traps, especially
    when they [have to] go too deep.\r\n- When I look at the darkness of that area,
    it seems a bit too light to me, which means the curves <em>have</em> been pulled
    in (like you would do when trapping).\r\n- That \"B\" seems to have gentle thorns
    (the inverse of a trap) so it seems to be attuned to output degradation (where
    trapping is most relevant). But I admit that could just be a stylistic thing.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a detail of the \u054B in Ernestine:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/twotraps_4091.gif]\r\nAlthough
    we didn't use shears, note how the curve/curve and curve/straight traps are visibly
    lightening things up.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIf it <em>is</em> filled-in, the reason
    is probably to avoid super-sharp corners, since they can cause rendering problems.
    I think Doyald Young recommended that any corner sharper than 30 degrees should
    have such a shear.\r\n\r\nIt would be very helpful to see other glyphs, like the
    Bold \"v\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the answers. The \"B\" in the picture above is from Microsoft's
    Candara font. I've checked the \"V\" of the regular and bold version of Candara,
    and their corners are filled too. \r\n\r\nI want to add this corner filler thing
    to my non-Latin font. I don't know how large the fill should be, so i tried to
    google for more information. Unfortunatelly I don't know what this thing is called
    among typographers. Perhaps to determine the size of the filler, I'll just look
    and compare the filler in the professionally made fonts. "

    shapes are outlined, and partly because FontAudit and all the seniors tells us
    to.

  body: "If you look at Candara's \"v\" you will see a clear trap there, even in the
    Regular. Now look at the \"k\": no shears on those sharp corners... Plus, like
    I said, Candara even has thorns. So since it's a very \"pointy\" design with at
    least some trapping, I think the shear in the \"B\" is a classic way to finish
    off a trap (which might be done to avoid it going too deep). But we can always
    ask Gary.  :-)\r\n\r\nBTW whether you want to add a shear to avoid pointiness
    or not, the Trapping Flower can do it: once you decide how big you want the shear
    to be (see below) you can figure out which measurement ring it should fall on,
    and use that ring as the cutoff for all the inside corners. You can even use the
    Flower to make thorns BTW - in which case it would be a rose...  ;-)\r\n\r\nTo
    decide the size of your shear: look at some respectable fonts, but do mind the
    point size range they're intended for, since fonts for display will have smaller
    shears than fonts for small text.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "This is best thought of not as an angle that is filled in but as a crotch
    in which the confluence of two curves or diagonals is spread apart a little. The
    purpose is, as Frode says, to lighten the join and stop the area becoming too
    dark where the bowl or stems come together.\r\n\r\n[Ink] Trapping is something
    very particular, which I don't think applies in this case. The purpose of an ink
    trap is, as the term suggests, to capture ink during printing. It is a special
    treatment of an internal angle designed to compensate for the phenomenon of inkspread
    that would otherwise distort the letter shape at this point. As such, ink traps
    are properly designed relative to output technologies. They are related to but
    technically distinct from two other phenomenon: similar feature in designs for
    phototypesetting that compensate for photomechanical softening of corners, and
    more general, output-independent optical compensations of the kind used in Candara
    and many other designs. \r\n\r\nThis illustration shows how this type of  construction
    enables one to open up the crotch while maintaining the shape of the curves further
    out. The same curves without the 'spreader' segment is in the background layer.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/crotch_5458.png]"

  body: PS. These days, I usually put a spreader section in the crotch of two straight
    lines only if it is a particularly acute angle or if the type weight is heavy
    and the white area small. But I always put one where convex curves come together.

    being determined to an extent by the resolution at which they are rendered. \r\n\r\nBy
    pre-empting the blunting that press gain, for instance, may produce, the designer
    produces a more consistent design, with a nominal appearance controlled to be
    closer to the set result than the really sharp points that may otherwise characterize
    the typeface when closely inspected in, for instance, online PDFs."

    used pejoratively for an attribute of a letterform that filled excessively on
    press, and it was precisely these ink traps that Griffith sought to *eliminate*
    and work around with the Linotype Legibility series of newspaper typefaces, ca.
    1920s."

    whether this is another case of designers wanting more control than they can really
    have, resulting in the sacrificing of something more important than \"consistency\".
    Namely the quality of the form when it can be consciously appreciated (read: large)
    versus when everything just blends in (read: small).\r\n\r\nNote that this thread
