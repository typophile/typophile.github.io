  the typefaces used. If anyone has any ideas about how I can find out about identifying
  typefaces from the period 1860-1910 that would be very useful. Here is one example\r\n\r\n"

  body: "If you just want to know what the names of the typefaces are (loads probably
    don't even have names/have never been digitized) then I am of no real help. But
    if you want to find fonts that are similar (and can be used for modern designing)
    then the first thing I would check is Walden Fonts for anything close to that
    style. They have a good selection of those old-timey display faces; and while
    they may not be exact matches they will be somewhat close. There are plenty of
    other places \r\n\r\nhttp://waldenfont.com"

    foundries, if I recall correctly. These may be of help for IDing.
