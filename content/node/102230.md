  All!\r\n\r\nThis font is from a series of four teaser posters for the Green Lantern
  movie (2011), designed by Concept Arts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.impawards.com/2011/green_lantern.html\">FULL
  POSTERS HERE</a>\r\n\r\nIs it just a customised version of \"MVB Sweet Square\"?
  The I, E, & K seem quite different. I've found a bunch of similar fonts (\"Aerotype
  Durandal Flat\", \"Piranha\" by Nathan Caldecott, \"Identikal Rally\", \"Identikal
  Rebirth\", \"FF Aircraft\"), but no exact matches.\r\n\r\nAlso, how would one classify
  this font? A \"chamfered angular square sans-serif\"?\r\n\r\n*** Bonus points if
  anyone can confirm whether the \"2011\" on the poster is even in the same font?
  ***\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!   :D\r\n"

    on [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=lantern|WhatTheFont Forum]].
    So, 2 possibilities: totally hand-drawn from scratch or customization from an
    existing typeface (what I prefer, less frustrating ;). Sweet Square is also the
    closest I''ve found but some details you''ve already spotted remain off (but not
    hard to reproduce). It also shares many similarities with [[www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection|United]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/kp-duty|KP Duty]] and [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/fullblock.php|Full
    Block]] but none of these ones are matching either.'

  body: Unfortunately Hrant, I worked on a different comic book movie than this one.
    My completely uninformed guess would be that they took an existing font (like
    Durandal Flat) and modified it for the movie. But since I didn't work on that
    one, I can't say for certain. Sorry, wish I could be more help.
