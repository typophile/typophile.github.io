    but I think it might Futura.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/\r\n\r\nIf
    you haven't already, perhaps try uploading the image on whatthefont.com. If that
    doesn't work you could try to identify it by focusing in on the ampersand as they
    tend to have unique design elements. \r\n\r\nGood luck! And, let us know how you
    made out!"
