  that is designed by a woman. Or at least its design process should include a woman.\r\n\r\nCurrently
  I have found Mrs. Eaves (which we don't want for its poor on-screen performance),
  JAF Garamond (co-designed by Shoko Mugikara and Tim Ahrens, but it is, alas, unreleased),
  and MVB Verdigris (designed by a male, and the font file is produced by a woman).
  Any suggestions?"

      I work as a summer <em>intern</em> for a local letterpress artist who collaborates
      with her friend \u2013 an illustrator \u2013 to produce postcards, posters,
      etc.. These two women <em>decided themselves</em> that their work should be
      on the subject of feminism. As they both have inferior knowledge about on-screen
      typography (while superior about print typography), I decided to help them by
      providing advice.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, as long as the typeface is beautiful
      and appropriate, I personally won't care if it is designed by a female or a
      male. But since it is a project about feminism, it's good to have a little secret:
      \"see, not only the physical objects are produced by women, even the typefaces
      are!\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe problem here, @Nick Shinn, is that you presumed
      that a) I am hired to do design work, and b) my clients are supposedly (hypocritical)
      male who wants the work look feminine. Undoubted, but only in that case would
      I see the hypocrites in the situation. If I were you, I probably would be more
      cautious about my presumptions before using vocabulary of moral condemnation

    If the postcard is to reflect feminism, admitting a female influence into the

      seems that you believe in some form of gender-specificism that would define
      a male designer as morally wrong if he ever taps into the females' design affairs
      (and probably vice versa?) \u2013 or, probably not morally wrong, but morally
      indecent. I disagree with this view; it seems to be a guise for imprudently
      extreme feminism. Yet I do not wish to elaborate my counterargument, since you
      have not clearly stated that you are with such views.\r\n\r\nI would like to
      emphasize that I have not participated in any of the work process of this series.
      My intern boss and her friend asked me if I have any ideas on an on-screen typeface
      that would replace their original choice, Mrs. Eaves, and I agreed to help them.
      There are only a few demands: beautiful, legible on screen, and designed by
      a female. And then off I went.\r\nThen it all goes back to my previous post:
      is it morally wrong (or indecent?) to accept their request simply because I
      am not a female and I have no right to participate in their design judgments?\r\n\r\nI
      said that I felt offended after I read your first reply in which you said without
      any other elaborated arguments that I am a hypocrite. I am not saying that I
      am offended by your wrong presumptions, although wrong presumptions can certainly
      bring out negative effects. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTokenism: <blockquote>the practice

    so there's a heightened risk of misinterpretation. I'm assuming that's what's
    happened here. With that said, Nick did bring up an interesting issue regarding
    the contradictions and inconsistencies in a male making artistic decisions on
    a project about women artists.\r\n\r\nI don't think the issue rises to the level
    of questioning ethics, honesty or suggesting possible hypocrisy. But it does point
    out some interesting kinks in how far to go in maintaining purity of concept when
    the issue in question lacks inherent purity. We're a single species, and attempts
    to draw immutable dividing lines between our component parts is not only unwise,
    it's an effort in futility.\r\n\r\nA project about feminism (or masculinity) is
    fine, and I like GrubStreet's idea of using typography designed by a woman; it's
    a clever behind-the-scenes extra. The fact that he's a male points back to my
    previous paragraph about how, in reality, we're all one and that our differences
    don't preclude the commonalities that make us inseparable and dependent upon one
    another. In other words, I see no problem with his participation in this feminist

    and purity of concept, though I have to agree when one says there is nothing inherently
    contradictory about a male designer working on a project about feminism.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    in what way does using a typeface designed by a female become anything about feminism?
    I think the notion that a female couldn't be found to do the job GrubStreet is
    doing makes the gender imbalance in the industry only more obvious. If this project
    is all about hidden symbolism, I would argue it's inconsistent hidden symbolism.\r\n\r\nWould
    you say if everything is designed by males the project becomes about male empowerment?
    I think not. I'm really annoyed with the fact that people think female exclusivity
    equates to feminism. You're not even verifying in what conditions these women
    made these typefaces.\r\n\r\nI think it's absolutely ridiculous restrictions have
    been set on the gender. Why wouldn't you select the typeface that works best for
    this project regardless of gender? Is someone going to say \"Yes, this project
    could have been better, but we put a restriction on the gender\". How is that
    feminist? It's ludicrous.\r\n\r\nFeminism is about equality, not exclusivity.
