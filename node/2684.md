body: This sample was sent to me for an ID. I think the bowl shapes remind me of Zapf
  &#40;like Meilor or Palatino&#41;, but I can&#39;t place the face. The &#39;S&#39;
  seems like it would be a good clue, but no &#39;slab&#39; serifs matched it where
  I looked. <BR> <BR>Anyone recognize it? Thanks.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23948.gif"

  body: You were on the right track. It&#39;s Melior Bold Condensed. I don&#39;t think
    it&#39;s available in digital format, though.

  body: Thanks Mark. So it is &#40;found a picture in the Jaspert Encyclopaedia&#41;.
    The l.c. &#39;r&#39; fooled me, because it&#39;s different than normal Melior
    &#39;r&#39;.

  body: It was almost a trick question the way Mike first put it. I was  <BR>thinking,
    &#34;if it&#39;s not Melior, what could it be?&#34; At first I  <BR>though Dominante,
    but that was not even close. Then, for  <BR>some reason, I looked at Melior &#40;in
    the Jaspert encyclopedia,  <BR>of course&#41;. It&#39;s odd that Bold Condensed
    was never  <BR>digitized.
