  body: I think it is PMN Caecilia, but they slanted the roman instead of using the
    real italic. See <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pmn-caecilia/85-heavy-oldstyle-figures/testdrive.html?s=BONUS%21&amp;p=36"

  body: I stand corrected -- it is PMN Caecilia. Some of the distinguishing features,
    like the hook on the &#34;a&#34;, disappear at this small size and low resolution.
