  i'm a student (graphicDesign/photography)\r\n2) have not taken very many design
  courses\r\n3) eager/willing to learn\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, here are the steps that I've
  taken -- mind you I have zero training in this department  :)\r\n\r\n\r\n1) sketches
  (hundreds).\r\n2) photograph/scans.\r\n3) streamline/illustrator vector.\r\n4) import
  EPS -> fontLab\r\n\r\n\r\nSo here's where the problem comes up. I'm vectoring the
  letterForms perfectly fine in illustrator. However, upon importing into fontLab,
  I'm finding apparitions at the ends/tips of the curves. I do not have sample images
  at the moment ( im at work ), however, I'll post some later. \r\n\r\nNevertheless
  -- some questions...\r\n\r\n1) am I following the accurate steps? \r\n2) are theres
  any webSites that can describe to me how to draw a serif typeFace\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  apologize if this was a cumbersome post, and thanks for reading through. Also, thanks
  in advance to all who respond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc.\r\n\r\n\r\nattached are some early
  sketches..."

    than illustrator so that could account for the differences. When that happens
    to me I usually just edit the glyph in fontlab because I like its drawing tool
    better for typefaces.\r\n\r\nAnd here is a website that is good for beginers.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics"

    Type</em> by Karen Cheng.\r\n\r\nYour steps seem fine. What is causing the vector
    inconsistencies, I don't know. You can also try to just copy paste from illustrator
    to FL, but that also is not the most accurate way."

  body: "Why is copying and pasting from Illustrator to FL considered less accurate?
    That's what I've been doing, and it seems to work fine.\r\n\r\nIn FL I make a
    box from the baseline to the cap height line and I cut and paste it into Illustrator.
    In Illustrator I scale my alphabet so the caps match the height of the imported
    box. Once all the letters are scaled up I can cut and paste them into FL and they
    are all the same relative size."

  body: "The trouble with pasting Illustrator paths into Fontlab lies in Fontlab's
    strict use of coordinate points. In Illustrator, you can place a node and it's
    control handles anywhere and adjust them in very fine increments. In Fontlab,
    the nodes and handles can only lie on its grid system of unit coordinates. For
    instance, if your Fontlab file is using a 1000 UPM value, the nodes must sit somewhere
    on a grid based on one thousand units per em square. \r\n\r\nWhen you import or
    paste a path from Illustrator, Fontlab will nudge the nodes and control handles
    into positions that fit onto the grid, basically altering the shapes just a bit.
    If you're seeing changes in the fine details of your curves, maybe set your Fontlab
    file to a higher UPM value (the new Cleartype fonts use a 2048 value, for instance)
    and see if that translates the Illustrator paths with greater accuracy."

    used to it; FL is much better for putting a typeface together. FL has auto-trace
    tools and will save you time. Just let go of Illustrator, learn the FL tools and
    you''ll be happier. '

    darkly hint that they'll pay for it eventually. In fact all but one have visibly

  body: Working directly in Fontlab will definitely causes fewer headaches, yes, especially
    once you adapt to how its drawing tools work. (In "Learn Fontlab Fast," Leslie
    Cabarga does an incredible job of showing how to manipulate paths in Fontlab in
    4 easy-to-digest spreads.)
