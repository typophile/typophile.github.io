  body: "Good spot Florian. That's one of the first times i have seen that font come
    up as a question here. I have always liked it, and especially the way it can flip
    forms in printing -- a very clever design from pre-OpenType days.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Being not all that familiar with programming and stuff it was the first time
    I realized that fonts on a computer are software when I came across Beowulf. There
    is a randomness built into the font that makes a glyph look slightly different
    every time it appears in a text when being printed - this to achieve an analog
    touch.\r\n\r\nfrom LettError:\r\n<em>PostScript allows the designer to build a
    font program that modifies, changes or switches letterforms. Beowolf is the first
    font (1989) we build with a randomisation routine. All points on the contour of
    a (fairly) normal typeface are given a space in which they can freely move. So
    instead of each letter having one fixed form, the shapes move and wobble. Every
    single letter this typeface will print will be unique. If characters are repeated
    in a text they will have different shapes.</em>\r\n\r\nKosmik works different
    \u2013 with contextual alternates (OpenType). Read about it -<a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/foundry/kosmik/index.html\">here</a>-.\r\n\r\nThere
    might have been a PS version of Kosmik once that worked like Beowulf, but I don\u2019t
    know for sure."

  body: "Vicky, in addition to what Jan said:\r\nHave a close look at your sample,
    especially double characters as in \u2018all\u2019, \u2018well\u2019, \u2018Books\u2019.
    There are different forms (glyphs) for one and the same character."

    simpler in implementation than Beowolf, because I think there were three versions
    of each (or certain) letter(s), and it rotated them as they appeared in the printing.
    It doesn't do it on-screen, as I recall.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
