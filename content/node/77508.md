  some kind of typeface. Here's what I've got (feel free to point out any rough spots
  you think might need refining):\r\n<!--break-->\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/qanda_3696.png]\r\nI'm
  trying to settle on a good font combination; a title font that's in similar spirit
  to the lettering, and a fairly neutral font for the copy.\r\n\r\nSo far, I'm thinking
  of using <a href=\"http://www.smeltery.net/fonts/megalopolis-extra\">MEgalopolis
  Extra</a>, since that's one of the inspiration sources, and <a href=\"http://www.fontslive.com/font/candara-family.aspx\">Candara
  Bold</a> (with regular there's an awkward weight contrast between the two).\r\n\r\nMy
  main problem is I want to use this on the web, but I can't quite spare the money
  to buy web usage of Candara. Is there a free/open-source/embeddable font that's
  similar or goes better with MEgalopolis? Actually, does anyone have suggestions
  for a better font combination?\r\n\r\nThanks."
