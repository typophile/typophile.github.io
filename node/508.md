  body: I think bj got it right, it&#39;s Psy/Ops Crash Numbering, the bottom of the
    2 over the top of the 3.  <BR>Like in a misaligned rubber-stamp-numbering-machine,
    or whatever its real name is.

  body: 'That is the correct answer, Jesus. <BR> <BR>BJ asked two questions: <BR>
    <BR>1. Is it the top &amp; bottom of the 2? <BR> <BR>2. Is it Crash Numbering
    from RXC? <BR> <BR>While the answer to Question 2 is yes, the answer to Question
    1 is no, because, as Jesus pointed out, it&#39;s the alternate 2, which shows
    the top of the 3. <BR> <BR>So on a technicality, I think Jesus wins it. <BR> <BR>Sorry,
    BJ!'
