  for a furniture manufacturer.\r\nAt this moment we (the customer and I) has agreed
  on a \"concept\" for the logo. (Attachment)\r\nA \"tag\"-based concept, which are
  to be used further in a variety of angles, positions and so on. All good, I like
  that, and the customer loves it. The goal is to create a profile which is playful,
  but at the same time has references to the industry. Hope you understand.\r\n\r\nThen.
  The customer loves the logo set in Helvetica Neue, and I hate to admit, but I kind
  of think it works in capitals.\r\n\r\nAnyways, if this is to be used. I want to
  present a complete manual for font use, sizes and weights. Headings, body etc.\r\n\r\nSo,
  now im kind of in the dark with all of this.\r\nWhat's recommended? Find a sans
  similar to Helvetica Neue (but better, more readable for smaller body copys). Or,
  leave Helvetica Neue for logo only. And maybe use something completely different
  for the rest of the profile? A nice modern serif or something?\r\n\r\nAnswers and
  tips are much appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks alot,\r\n\r\nMathias"

  body: "Hi Mathias,\r\n\r\nI really liked the logo and its simplicity. though I also
    know that whatever you write in helvetica neue, will always look good ;-)\r\n\r\nKeep
    helvetica on the logo as well as you can use it in headings, but I think u should
    look for some other non serif typeface which can be paired with helvetica. Because
    helvetica doesnt look good in body text as i feel.\r\n\r\n\r\nsatya -\r\nIndia\r\n\r\n"

    i think this is a good way to keep the *\"Alleinstellungsmerkmal\" (unique characteristics)
    of the logo. I don't like the concept to use the font used in the logo anywhere
    else in the corporate design. It weakens the logo in my opinion.\r\n\r\n* it's
    german, sorry, i tried to translate it \u2013 unique characteristics \u2013 came
    out. I don't know if it really gets the meaning\u2026\r\n\r\nPS I like the logo,
    too.\r\n"

  body: 'satya & poms: Thanks a lot for your answers and kind feedback! I think i''m
    more into the idea of not using helvetica neue further in the profile again. But
    I really need some tips on fonts or pairings that could "help" the logo and vice
    versa.'

  body: "Hmmm A rule that kinda has worked for me in pairing sans serifs and serifs
    is to try fonts from the same designer. Examples of fonts that work well together
    are (not suggestions in this case) ITC Avant Garde & Lubalin but this is overused
    by many designers (Grafik Magazine is a good example of the harmony between these
    2 fonts) Another example is Univers and Serifa (both from Frutiger). In your case
    since Max didn't design any exciting serifs how about using some of Tobias Frere-Jones's
    typefaces like Gotham in the logo and a serif like Mercury. I have not tried this
    but I think it might work (all found on Typography.com) You could also try a font
    that has both serifs and sans weights) One that I recently used is Andrea Tinnes's
    Skopex but this is in a different style than you already sketched for the client.
    \r\n\r\nBTW I also like the logo but think it is an easy way out for you. Anything
    looks good in Helvetica and it is the reason why it is so overused by designers
    today. Check out www.the-letterbox.com.au for funny comments on the topic (The
    book/publication Grand)\r\n\r\nDeath to Helvetica and long live creativity;-) "
