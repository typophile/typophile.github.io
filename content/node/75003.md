  body: Most likely, the sign is hand-painted, and the typeface doesn't correspond
    to anything you'll find in a type specimen catalog...

  body: It looks like a condensed version of Doric or Doris.  Because of the camera
    angle it's tough to tell exactly how these layout in line weight (thick and thin,
    or equal line weight).  This may very well have been painted by hand but most
    sign painters tend to follow a formula or lettering style, especially for something
    like this where the company wants to keep a certain look for signs on their buildings,
    their trucks, etc.  So while you may get some mild variations in line weight,
    the overall lettering style will remain the same.
