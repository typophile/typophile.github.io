  body: Hi, this looks like [[http://store2.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-NL&event=displayFontPackage&code=1186&PID=930349|Frutiger]].

  body: Thank you!  This really threw me because Frutiger was my first guess. But
    when I lined it up, the "G" looked much rounder on the sample above and didn't
    fit either Frutiger Roman or Light versions that I have.  The leading also threw
    me.  But taking a second look at it & adjusting the leading, I think you're definitely
    correct.  I don't know what weights their using, as I don't have the complete
    font package, but I love the clean and forward look of how they treated this simple
    font.  Thanks for your help!  Jennifer

  body: "There's also a possibility that it's [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe|Segoe]],
    Microsofts version of Frutiger.\r\nBut it's hard to tell at this size.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    on second thought, given what it actually says, Segoe is more likely :) "

    \ I'll go with Fruitiger.  Thanks for your help!  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.istartedsomething.com/20070531/download-segoe-collection/\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ok...I downloaded it for free from this site.  I don't think it's the Segoe
    from Microsoft because the I has feet on the top & bottom (sorry, don't know the
    technical term for horizontal lines on the top & bottom of a capital I).  Other
    than that, it's looking pretty identical.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, here's the link in
    case you want the font:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontyukle.com/en/ara.php?ara=segoe"
