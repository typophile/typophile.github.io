    detail based on the specimen I have. Coiner\u2019s letters for the NRA often feel
    a little harder and draw more attention and I tried to work that into Recovery.
    FB Eagle Bold feels a little lighter, some angles and points aren\u2019t as sharp,
    and overall it feels a little quieter, perhaps because Dave drew it to work alongside
    the book weight. There are also some letters in both that depart pretty dramatically
    from the quirky gothic letters by Benton: Recovery drops Benton\u2019s too-narrow
    S, FB Eagle uses a different K for example. \r\n\r\nEagle also features a much
    larger character set and fractions, whereas FB Eagle adds a lowercase."

  body: "Nick, If Recovery is a copy, then what is FB Eagle?\r\n\r\nI don't believe
    it's a \"diss\" to make considered, subjective changes when producing a digital
    revival, especially if they are measured and intended by the designer and preferable
    to the user.  In addition to the more notably redrawn \"S\", Recovery exhibits
    what I would argue to be a more balanced visual equality.  The repositioning of
    counters/bowls alone is a notable departure from what James rightfully refers
    to as Benton's \"quirky gothic letters\".  James never referred to anything as
    a mistake on Benton's part.\r\n\r\nI also respectfully object to your tone.  \"Fiddling
    with some character widths and metrics\" is one of the greatest technological
    advantages we have today in chasing a well-designed and well-proportioned typeface.
    \ We learn through play, and if Benton were to work in FontLab today, I'm sure
    he'd fiddle a symphony."

    with some character widths and metrics\u201D is one of the greatest technological
    advantages we have today in chasing a well-designed and well-proportioned typeface.</em>\r\n\r\nWell,
    that's debatable. The design and proportions of a typeface bear an intimate relationship
    to the technology used at the time it's made. So fiddling isn't really a technological
    advantage, because all eras have technology that can be used to finesse widths
    and metrics.\r\n\r\nBut the point I was making was not about the merits of tinkering
    per se, but that Recovery is claimed to be a \"reinterpretation\", not a close
    revival with one letter redesigned and a lot of subtle nuancing. Looking at Coiner's
    letters (are there more than four in this style?) one would expect a reinterpretation
    to be much different than closely following in the footsteps of Benton and Berlow.\r\n\r\nLook,
    I've done revivals, and while I think original work deserves more respect, I don't
    think there's anything inherently wrong with doing them, although it's an ethical
    minefield. What prompted me to contribute to this thread was the gap between James'
    ambitious conception of the amount of socially relevant meaning that can inform
    a typeface, and the reality of releasing a close copy as one's first commercial
    type design. At Typecon, he showed me an original design he was working on, so
    I was disappointed to see Recovery and not that. \r\n\r\nHopefully he will give
    me similar consideration next time I post a new release in this forum...\r\n"

  body: "I think \"reinterpretation\" is a fair and accurate term.  An analogy...\r\n\r\nA
    text can be interpreted from one language to another\u2014or even from an older
    dialect to more modern usage\u2014and be \"fiddled\" with enough with respect
    to the meanings of words and the nuance of grammar.  The spirit of the text ought
    to remain the same.  Whether it is true to the original is a matter of subjective
    comprehension and perception.  Scholars and critics may argue indefinitely over
    all the finer points.  Publishers will print variations as the market demands
    and ethics abide.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a typeface can be interpreted.  Coiner's work
    was invariably filtered by Benton's experience and the technology of their day,
    and further augmented by Font Bureau to meet the demands of the <em>Publish!</em>
    project.  James has chosen to interpret Coiner's and Benton's work, contributing
    a certain degree of nuance that many will find valuable and preferable to other
    reproductions.  Recovery is recognizably rooted in the ATF Eagle specimen.  For
    that it is an interpretation, however faithful you wish to judge it.  Recovery
    comes after FB Eagle, so we respectfully call it a \"<em>re</em>interpretation\".
    \ There's nothing dubious about the word.\r\n\r\nI believe \"a lot of subtle nuancing\"
    is a considerable contribution to breathing new life into a typeface.  In any
    sort of design practice, nuance is the fine line between a desirable work and
    something less preferable.\r\n\r\nJames may have come across as ambitious in his
    artist's statement <em>slash</em> ad copy, but such is the nature of marketing.
    \ He's an inspired and disciplined new talent.  I don't think it's fair to scold
    him for being so.  I personally pushed him to work on the Recovery PDF so as to
    explain his intentions with this project, so blame me for fostering his lofty
    claims.  His passion for this stuff is however evident and valued.  Recovery is
    an excellent first release."

    that Eagle Bold was a perfect typeface (nor do I consider my work perfect), and
    I hardly think that my saying so is any sort of attack on a great designer.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the revival/reinterpretation argument, at the end of the day it\u2019s a relatively
    trivial argument over semantics. Maybe revival would be a better word. Maybe it\u2019s
    the word I would have used if I had the decades of experience under my belt that
    Nick does. But it was not chosen to try and raise myself up over any other designer.
    Nor was it used to imply that Recovery is an original design. \r\n\r\nThe essay
    in the Recovery specimen isn\u2019t great. I\u2019ll probably end up rewriting
    it. But it\u2019s really just ad copy\u2014it\u2019s not like this is appearing
    in <em>Baseline</em>. In retrospect, I overstressed the importance of Coiner because
    I felt that his contribution to the design of Eagle is neglected\u2014the entire
    design is usually attributed to Benton. This was not meant as a slight to Benton,
    although I see how it can be interpreted that way.\r\n\r\nAnd as for my original
    works, they\u2019re coming. Recovery was done as a break from art school before
    getting back to the original stuff. The face I showed at Typecon is a very ambitious
    design; I doubt it will see a release for at least a few years. Then again, with
    the job market the way it is, I may have time to get it done by spring ;)"
