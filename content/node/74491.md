  body: I got the name from a manual stencil cutting company.  We currently use a
    computerized system and Gerber software, but the cemetery mausoleum we are inscribing
    has an older style of Roman.  When I consulted the previous engraver he said it
    is roman modified several times and not modified roman.  A past engraver confirmed
    this as well.

  body: "Ahh, this would explain why you're having difficulty finding a digital version.
    Many engraver\u2019s fonts or templates have not been digitized and when they
    have they are often given a new name. Do you have a sample of the font?"
