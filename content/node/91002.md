  I can figure out, like \r\n\r\n\"capital A with right-opened half ring above\"\r\n\r\nBut
  then we hit\r\n\r\n\"a with acute and slanted half 'c' above\"\r\n\r\nWhich is clearly
  different that the half ring.\r\n\r\nAnybody know what a \"slanted half c\" is in
  the Cheyenne language, or anything else, for that matter? If not a character in
  Unicode, then in anything? It may be *signage* as a part of the heraldry rather
  than a linguistic use, and I'll get up with the authors if needed, but it is going
  to be one of those things that will have to be done quickly (& isn't everything
  these days?)."

  body: "David,\r\n\r\nNo, I know that one. I have a pencil drawing provided -- you
    know what that's like, basic shape only. What they've drawn is an 'a' with an
    acute accent, with either the half ring or \"short slanted c\" beside the acute.
    Of course, in the drawing, they exaggerated the half ring -- it is drawn to almost
    a \"u\" on it's side -- to differentiate it from the \"c\" (no serifs in pencil
    drawings). If you ask for more, they draw it again :-(\r\n\r\nI could always make
    up a superior italic \"c\", scale it narrower, etc. etc. but it gets very tiring
    playing the \"is it this?\" game, and you always risk authors not realizing what
    you *can* do, so they settle for something less than ideal.\r\n\r\nIf a *typophile*
    knew what it should be, I'd trust that.\r\n\r\nThanks, though..."

  body: I don't see such a mark combination in the Glenmore and Leman orthography.
    Perhaps it's meant as some sort of prosodic marker for notating song? In any case,
    if you're getting this from the editor at the press, I think you should probably
    go directly to the author(s) if possible - in my experience there's generally
    less miscommunication about weird glyphs in a direct dialogue, and you'll need
    to confirm whatever you draw with the person who knows exactly what they're trying
    to indicate anyway.

  body: 'A chirographic analysis: if one has just written an acute accent, from lower
    left to upper right, the tendency will be to write either a following half circle
    or inverted reversed comma sign as a quick curved stroke back down and to the
    right, rather than, say, taking the time to very carefully judge the position
    of the top right of the half circle relative. So this will tend to produce a rotated
    accent in writing, but I''m with Ross in thinking that this is probably intended
    to be either the half circle or reversed inverted comma aspiration mark.'

  body: "Well, I've started the long, laborious process of getting up with the authors.
    For those of you who don't know, the \"proper channel\" is to first make contact
    with the designer, who passes you off to the copyeditor, who passes you to the
    acquiring editor, who then, after several fits & starts, passes you to the authors...\r\n\r\n(Shortcutting
    this is why I post these things here!)\r\n\r\nI'm going to ramble now...\r\n\r\nI
    did hear from the designer, so we're started. She's going to use Charis, to take
    advantage of the character compliment. It's a Charis I've reworked, so it sets
    well, but is not, shall we say, attractive. Not it's purpose.\r\n\r\nI was hoping
    to finally have found a book that warranted purchasing Huronia, but I guess that
    will have to wait. Another problem is University Press budgets are awfully tight
    just now, and talking them into purchasing a typeface takes a lot of work -- and
    usually some examples of printed books.\r\n\r\nAs a typesetting firm, we were
    able to stir up interest in Sumner Stone's Cycles back in the days when printing
    was repro-negative-plate, but Sumner just never reweighted Cycles for direct-to-plate
    printing. While I'm pretty sure he'd let me do the work, I just never quite found
    the time. & when it comes to selling the presses on purchasing it, there are more
    alternatives to Cycles than to Huronia.\r\n\r\nI don't think weight will be a
    problem with Huronia. It looks like it will print fine DPT. I just need to buy
    it, & use if for one of the rare projects I design as well as set. Or talk a designer
    into using tracings for layouts, then let us purchase it & set a book with our
    licensed copies.  Sadly, the days when a designer can work that way are gone...\r\n\r\n*
    * *\r\nI've know of Ross Mills ever since Richard Eckersley came back from somewhere
    all excited after meeting Ross & discussing fonts for setting Native American
    languages. Richard's gone now, and I'm still waiting for an opportunity to work
    with Ross. One of the Native American books we do maybe, or maybe Matt Avery at
    Chicago will get some money in the budget. I know Matt is interested in Huronia
    generally, and he & Isaac Tobin are very good designers, well beyond the \"up
    & coming\" stage.\r\n\r\nOK, I'll stop rambling & complaining now...\r\n\r\nThanks
    for everyone's help; I suspect it will come back as John & Ross said."

  body: I wouldn't have thought so. Rightward motion tends to have priority in the
    ductus of LTR scripts, especially if one knows one is subsequently going to be
    writing another sign to the right of the acute. It is moe efficient, and efficiency
    is also what is likely to produce the rotation in the second sign.

  body: "As you say, its really up to the authors to confirm the intent of the mark.
    It could be one of aspiration, or perhaps more likely for Cheyenne, one of tone\u2014simply
    using a glyph form more commonly associated with aspiration, per se. That exact
    <em>form</em> of the mark is not one I recall coming across, although I have come
    across a superior 'c' on a few occasions. It wouldn't surprise me if it originates
    from a small, raised italic 'c' being used, depending on the era from which it
    originates. Or it could simply be an artifact of handwritten form, or something
    else entirely. In any case, its easily handled by mapping it as an alternate (once
    you establish what the most appropriate base form is [u+02BB, u+02BF, u+0314...]).
    I suppose it could also be related to the breve, circumflex or caron, or even
    one of the various forms of glottal, all of which have been used in Cheyenne orthographies.
    I could speculate further, but its probably pointless as the author can no doubt
    give a categorical answer."

  body: "<cite>I can understand that exact preservation of the original is important
    in scholarly publications. </cite>\r\n\r\nLess often than you might think. Either
    that, or we trivialize \"scholarly\" work. It's a good point, but your preaching
    to the choir. \r\n\r\nOr maybe I'm the Bible thumper here...\r\n\r\nOne thing
    people may not know about scholarly publishing is \"acquiring editor\" is now
    a quite different job than \"editor.\" It used to be a part-time duty of an editor,
    and the main challenge was to find a nice way to reject authors work -- \"I'm
    sorry, but your manuscript does not fit our list at this time.\" (Unless the author's
    name was, say, \"Samuelson\"...)\r\n\r\nNow, acquisitions should be a part of
    marketing -- the acquiring editor tries to convince authors to sign up with a
    publisher. \r\n\r\nAs with so many things, giveaways help.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,
    you're right, we need to include that 72-dpi picture of Adolph Hitler, no one
    knows what the man looked like...\" \r\n\r\n\"It's wonderful that you had the
    stain on page 76 of  J.D. Salinger's manuscript analyzed, showing that it was
    Lipton tea rather than Bigelow. We'll be sure find a way to include a representation
    of that stain in the extract when it is typeset.\"\r\n\r\nTo be serious for a
    minute, the original purpose of scholarly publishing -- at least, as a part the
    university -- was to publish work that was important, but aimed at such a small
    audience it would not be economically viable for a commercial publisher.\r\n\r\nDuring
    the tight times in the 1980s, almost all university administrations decided their
    presses needed to run lower deficits. Easiest way for a press to do that was to
    publish more titles, and start adding works that might make money. One press,
    located quite close to me, published about 20-25 books a year  in 1979. Now they
    publish close to 100 a year.\r\n\r\nWell, all sorts of changes in all parts of
    the book world. Eventually, scholarly publishing may morph into something that
    again makes sense. Right now, the whole business looks a little too much like
    late night television, with commercials hawking products with limited appeal.
