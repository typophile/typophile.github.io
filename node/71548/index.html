  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>It&rsquo;s not quite a &ldquo;who&rsquo;s buried in Grant&rsquo;s tomb&rdquo; type of question &ndash; I used to do letterpress printing in a cold metal shop but I haven&rsquo;t retained this datum. The one lettepress printer I asked so far didn&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>
<p>Most type is cast out of a lead alloy that&rsquo;s made with tin and antimony.</p>
<p>Are the actual strips of leading made out of the same metal, or pure lead?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing they were pure lead, because I remember them being much softer than pieces of type (and hence easier to bend and cut).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As far as my knowledge reaches, the composition of leading could vary as much as the composition of the sorts themselves. Making it pure lead would make it easier to cut, but it would also be easier to accidentally bend in the long strips, and it would be much heavier than if it were mixed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it depended on the specific letterpress. Leading wouldn&rsquo;t really need any &ldquo;harder&rdquo; metals as it doesn&rsquo;t receive much eroding over time, so maybe many left out other metals as they were more costly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Matthew — I checked a few references I have here and couldn’t find specific information about type metal for leads. The 1923 ATF catalogue offers 1-point leads in brass (presumably, you want 1-point leads a bit harder) and the rest in “metal,” without elaboration.</p>
<p>You should try contacting Theo Rehak. He would undoubtedly know, or be able to give a very educated guess. <a href="http://nicksherman.com">Nick Sherman</a> might have contact information for Rehak. Nick’s helping a couple guys who are working with Theo to revitalize the Dale Guild Type Foundry (a true metal foundry, not just in name).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Leading and other strip materials for letterpress are generally cast from an alloy that has a higher percentage of lead, so is cheaper to buy, usually about the same alloy as what was used for Linotype metal (since Linotype slugs were generally printed from once and then melted down to recast; they didn&rsquo;t need to be hard for repeated reuse).</p>
<p>I have never seen 1 pt. brass leads - too expensive! It&rsquo;s very easy to tell the difference between 1 pt. and 2 pt. leads when you have them in hand.</p>
<p>The 1 and 2 pt. leads will flex just because they are long and thin compared to lead type. A 6 pt. slug of the same length will not noticeably flex.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As far as I remember from my Art School days when we used loose type, the thinner ones were made of brass and quite delicate.</p>
<p>Thicker ones of a kind of light metal (might have been an aluminum alloy) and the even thicker ones, including the material to lock up the composition were made of an ironlike metal where a lot of hollow interior shapes were used to lighten the weight of these elements.</p>
<p>I have one of the medium (alu?) ones somewhere, but I guess having that tested for its composition is out of my reach…</p>
