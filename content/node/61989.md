  school i am creating a Type poster about the space race. There is to be commentary
  on what was going on in that era (the late 60's) So far the poster has somewhat
  of an international style. Mainly, it is about the USA vs USSR in the race to space.
  I am aware that the cold war was going on at this time as well, Also possibly turning
  it into a bit of a propaganda poster could work as well. \r\n\r\nNow, i was wonder
  if you guys could point me in the direction of some reference material which talks
  a bit about how design or typography was affected by the space race or the cold
  war.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be great!"

    is the \"industrial/futuristic\" style influenced by the signage on rockets, and
    the more widespread exposition to cyrillic."

  body: "Thanks for the info!\r\n\r\nI've spent all day trying to figure this thing
    out. Trying some faux cyrillic typefaces etc. I'm moving more toward a Cold War
    Modern/Swiss style. I'm trying to incorporate more of a propaganda feel to it
    as well. Right now it says, \"better dead than red\" and there is a spaceman falling
    from a moon shape.\r\n\r\nI'll have to keep researching and pushing it.\r\n\r\nAny
    more suggestions welcome!"

    and punch-card fonts, etc.? \r\n\r\nBecause I believe there is a lot of more fanciful
    type design inpired by the space race... Maybe think Jetsons - space-agey & weird.\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"
