  body: "pretty sure its <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-avant-garde-gothic/bold/\">avant
    garde gothic bold</a>, but the A is either made manual or with the real ligatures/alternates,
    for example found <a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/mondosearchresults.htm?st=12&kid=itc%20avant%20garde%20pro\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nif
    you only need the alternative A, its pretty easy to do in illustrator."
