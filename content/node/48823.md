body: There seems to be so many versions.  I am designing a book with Caslon Book
  and would like to pull out some quotes, parts of which are in italic. Caslon's italic
  looks a bit messy to me. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

  body: "For pull quotes I'd use Big Caslon. The roman is available from several sources
    (if you have a Mac it came with the system). Big Caslon Italic is harder to come
    by: contact Carter & Cone for that: http://www.carterandcone.com\r\n\r\nAnother
    possibilities are Caslon 540 and <a href=\"http://www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/kingscaslon/typo\">King's
    Caslon.</a>\r\n\r\nSomeday the long awaited William's Caslon, from our very own
    William Berkson, will be available. (Nudge, nudge William.) "

  body: CaslonBooKBE is a Berthold font:Caslon Book. It's quite different from the
    Adobe cut. The Berthold face is a bit darker and has shorter descenders. I like
    the Adobe cut better, but if I was setting small type, say 8 point, I might use
    the BE font.

  body: "I think Lange's versions of many of the classic typefaces like Caslon are
    very nice in extended text settings at sizes around 10 and 11 pt. I prefer Caslon
    Book to Adobe Caslon, and Baskerville Book to Storm or ITC's versions. I also
    think the Berthold Bodonis are quite nice.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Berthold text fonts are typically optimized for 9 pt rather than everyone
    else's 12 pt. Adobe Caslon is designed for 8-14 and is best at 10-12. I think
    it's my favourite of all the Adobe text faces, a great triumph for Twombly and
    of course the art director for the Originals in those days, Sumner Stone. I love
    Berthold fonts as a rule, but I remember being disappointed by the Caslon. The
    comments here make me want to have a new look -- it's been years. But just look
    at how well Adobe Caslon works in the New Yorker. Perfectly credible, graceful,
    transparent. Happy, even. Very few fonts give me that feeling, other than Sumner
    Stone's Cycles family. \r\n\r\nAs Ryan says, the Berthold Bodonis are very much
    worth looking for. One's basically for display, very high contrast, and another
    - - I forget the name - - Antiqua? Classic? something? - - is absolutely sensational
    in text - - setting even more fluently than Sumner Stone's ITC Bodoni 12. But
    I hate the g - - and for that reason would always use ITC Bodoni, which has the
    additional advantage of small text and display sizes. But if the g doesn't bother
    you . . . . "

  body: There are a couple of recent Font Font efforts in this area, I forget the
    names now, but I looked at them some last year. One was very high contrast and
    I felt was a candidate for display work, but in the end I went back to the Bertholds.
    The negative there though, besides the general Berthold vibe, is that you get
    the old 8-bit character set, no modern glyph goodies. Which of course, sucks.
