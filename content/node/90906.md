body: "Is there any glyph difference between 'Em dash' (\u2014 U+2014) and the 'Horizontal
  bar' (\u2015 U+2015)?\r\nThere are a number of dashes encoded on Unicode, but this
  is one of the few that is not very clear its usage. Unicode calls the horizontal
  bar 'quotation dash', yet is not clear why it was encoded differently, as all bibliography
  I've read makes no distinction between the dash used for parenthetical text and
  quotations. Fonts I've seen makes horizontal bar longer, shorter or both characters
  the same. Recurrently the em dash connect to the sides of the character width, but
  the horizontal bar not. A difference in the characters properties is that em dash
  makes line breaks while horizontal bar don't\u2014which may make sense as distinguishing
  them semantically, but don't give much hints for the glyph side.\r\nI probably won't
  be very interested by this, but the horizontal bar is included in an old Windows
  character set for Greek, along Em dash. I'm not sure if is used down there or not."

  body: I've read those before but they really don't answer my question. Besides perhaps
    Math characters, Unicode don't encode character based on the semantic meaning
    and if does something like encoding specifics "glyphs" is for compatibility with
    other stuff. The em dash don't seems to having to look any different when used
    either for parenthetical text nor quotations (I speak Spanish and I use it regularly
    for both) so I'm intrigued about what is the purpose of the 'horizontal bar' at
    all.

  body: "It's used as a direct quotation device in several typesetting trads, hence
    its other name, 'quote dash'. What little I have found about it says it should
    be some 2 ems or so. Usage:\r\n\r\n--- Text text text, said Foo. --- More text."

  body: "In Sweden (and I believe other Scandinavian countries) an En Dash is used
    instead of an Em dash for the conversation dash. I'm assuming it has a separate
    codepoint so as to enable coutry/language-specific alternates without messing
    with the \"real\" Em dash? (Not that it matters much. In Sweden the Em dash is
    as far as I know only used for one thing these days \u2013 omitting the author's
    name in repeated references in a bibliography.)"

  body: "The length of an em dash in contemporary typefaces these days tends to vary
    quite a bit and often does not measure an actual em. In my own work, for instance,
    I generally prefer an em dash which is on the order of 75\u201380% of an em, and
    I include modest sidebearings. This seems to work well for contemporary usage
    (current American practices, anyway).\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some traditions
    that prefer (or even demand) a nominal em dash \u2014 i.e., one that measures
    precisely a full em. I believe Spanish is one of these.\r\n\r\nAnd there are some
    situations where a full-length, nominal em dash may be preferable \u2014 building
    three-em dashes for bibliographies, for instance. \r\n\r\nThe norm in Font Bureau
    fonts these days (I hesitate to call it a standard) is to provide both a \u201Cdesigned\u201D
    em dash, according to the type designer\u2019s preference, as the default, plus
    a \u201Cnominal\u201D em dash which measures a full em and has no sidebearings.
    The default is, of course, encoded u+2014, while the nominal em dash is encoded
    as u+2015 horizontal bar. We provide a {locl} substitution for Spanish, as well
    as a dedicated stylistic set {ss18} for accessing the nominal dashes, for those
    who prefer.\r\n\r\n(We provide a similar pair of en dashes, but the nominal en
    dash is not assigned a unique code point.)"
