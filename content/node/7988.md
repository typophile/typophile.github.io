  a good, representative collection of faces from the era, from 1937&#39;s Coronet
  up to about Nov 1963: Murray Hill, Futura, Park Avenue, Balloon Extrabold, Gillies
  Gothic Bold, etc. <BR> <BR>I use Linux exclusively: GIMP for Web-based graphic design
  and TeX for print-based typesetting. I want to use the fonts primarily in GIMP,
  for Web work, but I&#39;d also like to be able to use them occasionally with TeX,
  for the purpose of printing cards, letterheads, and the like. <BR> <BR>Can anyone
  recommend a source for these fonts, and a format &#40;PostScript Type 1, TrueType,
  etc&#41; that will work for me?'

  body: For use with TeX, I stick with Type 1, although you can use TrueType and with
    some pain, OpenType as well. Installing the fonts for use with TeX is not trivial,
    but it isn&#39;t quite so bad, if you read the excellent <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide/fontinstallationguide.pdf">TeX
    font installation guide</a>.  <BR> <BR>As for where to buy the fonts, I usually
    buy from Adobe, Linotype, FontShop, etc. Avoid the generic rip-offs, though.

  body: Thanks, that&#39;s exactly the information I was looking for! <BR> <BR>I prefer
    to use Type 1 because they seem to work easy in X; once installed, GIMP and other
    applications just magically have them. <BR> <BR>Most foundries only seem to offer
    Mac and Windows options. I suppose Type 1 fonts for Windows on CD or downloaded
    will work on Linux? <BR> <BR>Just found some of the beautiful old faces I&#39;m
    looking for available from Linotype.com. Happy to see them but guess I&#39;m a
    little surprised at the prices for some of these 70-year-old typefaces. A <a href="http://www.linotype.com/89150/gilliesgothic-family.html">single
    4-font family</a> will set you back $80-100---the cost of doing business for a
    commercial publication, surely, but it seems a little impractical for hobbyists
    and free-lance part-timers! <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love to see them sold in packs, like
    how <a href="http://fontdiner.com/">Font Diner</a> does it. They sell new fonts
    with a &#34;retro&#34; aesthetic---I haven&#39;t tried them yet but the quality
    seems good, and you can get about a dozen for $30.

  body: Yes, you will want the PC Type 1 fonts.  <BR> <BR>For buying Linotype faces,
    often the more you buy, the cheaper the prices. &#40;Just add more to your cart,
    and the prices update.&#41; Unfortunately, that&#39;s not the case with all the
    fonts, though. I&#39;d love to get Optima Nova, but not enough people are beating
    down my door with freelance jobs for me to afford it.

    are still pricey, but I think that the cost is a good one for the number of weights
    one receives. <BR> <BR>Also, we have some Value Packs. These prices vary depending

    its initial sales price is only around $30. If you sign up for the Linotype newsletter,

  body: Dan, appreciate the links. I took note of the many themed Value Packs, and
    wonder if Linotype would ever consider releasing Packs of fonts collected by time
    period? <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to improve my collection with a concern for quality
    and authenticity over quantity---but this being an amateur operation &#40;at least
    for now, anyway&#41;, I&#39;m on a tight budget. I have the basic PostScript printer
    fonts, all of the fonts that come with teTeX, and some of the extra CTAN fonts.
    Can anyone recommend other sources for obtaining good Level 1 fonts---particularly
    mid-century---on a budget? <BR> <BR>I keep reading about the Bitstream 500 font
    CD and the 250 font CD, and they&#39;re recommended in both the comp.fonts FAQ
    and the Linux Font HOWTO, but these CDs no longer appear to be available by Bitstream,
    nor do they show up used on eBay. <BR> <BR>One source I did find that offers a
    collection of type scanned from vintage sources is the <a href="http://www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/PropFonts.html">HPLHS
    Prop Fonts</a> CD, and I wonder if anyone here has seen it.

    &#40;I even have sketches for at several ideas sitting in a pile on my desk right
    now&#41;. If you have any specific ideas of typefaces that might fit together
    into one package, I&#39;d love to hear them. Feel free to e-mail me; I&#39;ll

  body: I haven&#39;t seen the retail product, but the free fonts I&#39;ve seen from
    HPLHS are of truly abysmal quality. There&#39;s a complete lack of understanding
    about baselines, sidebearings, and other fundamental things in font development.
    <BR> <BR>Too bad. I had hopes for those fonts, and HPLHS does so many other cool
    things. First time I heard their &#34;Shoggoth on the Roof&#34; CD I almost wet
    myself laughing. <BR> <BR>T

    <a href="http://www.ahleman.com/">Andrew Leman</a>, who put it together, is a
    prop designer who also sells &#40;via myfonts.com&#41; a collection of vintage
    font props called <a href="http://www.ahleman.com/fonts/FontIndex.html">E-phemera</a>---but

    seen on the HPLHS site leads me to think so. I&#39;m just saying his fonts are
    really not very good, though it depends on the use one is going to put them to
    &#40;using them for props would not be crazy&#41;. <BR> <BR>Are you doing this
    stuff for some sort of RPG or LARP? <BR> <BR>T

  body: No, not using it for an RPG although I&#39;m impressed by the elaboration
    they&#39;ve done for those games as detailed on that Lovecraft site. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    looking for these fonts primarily for Web design at the moment, although letterhead
    and a print logo is also in view. <BR> <BR>As for the &#34;vintage&#34; aspect,
    my study is the ideals and design aesthetics of that time in Western civilization
    that predates the ruinous counter-culture. The idea is not to be simply &#34;retro&#34;---mimicking
    the relics of a frozen moment of the past, as viewed from the present---but to
    apply those principles to elevate the present situation.

    Industries type doesn&#39;t qualify as it is all new type, even if they have paid
    homage to past periods.
