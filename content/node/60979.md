  wonderful forum.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a <strong>reasonably</strong> priced sans
  serif font (something like Frutiger or Myriad). I tried quoting for Segoe UI (<em>yes,
  I know that it's a reap off from Frutiger</em>) Ascendercorp who is responsible
  for providing licenses for it and they gave me price quote at $1500 per year for
  letting me distribute their font in my application. It's a bit too much for me -
  I'm trying to create a stylish application for personal home use and I'm doing only
  first steps to make it. I even didn't start selling it yet.\r\n\r\nSo enough with
  my boring explanation. Does anybody know good Sans Serif font with license to distribute
  it in the commercial application with a price below $1000?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: You should explain your application a little bit more. Will the text be editable
    or non-editable? Will you subset the font? Will the user have access to the original
    fonts?

  body: "How exactly do you use the font in your application?\r\n\r\nDo you distribute
    it so that it gets installed like any regular font on the user's computer? Or
    do you embed it in your application so only the application itself can use it?\r\n\r\nAnd
    is it used interactively (the user can type in some text and it is displayed with
    the font), or non-interactively (only the application itself uses the font to
    display text)?\r\n\r\nIf you answer these questions, it might become more clear
    what kind of licence you would need exactly."

    to make an application for managing personal finances - bills, accounts and other
    stuff like that :)\r\n\r\n<em>Ivo,</em>\r\nThe font I'm looking for will be used
    in user interface for static labels and also in various grids and controls. So
    users will be able to view and edit texts displayed using that font. I'm not going
    to subset the font. Users will not be able to use the font outside the application.\r\n\r\n<em>Bert,</em>\r\nThanks,
    I will try contact him - Museo is looking very good.\r\n\r\n<em>Jens,</em>\r\nPart
    of your questions I answered in reply to Ivo. The font will not be installed in
    users Fonts directory. I will also embed it so to prevent users from installing
    it or using it them selfs :)"

  body: "I see. Then 1500$ seem to be a fair deal from my view. Other foundries may
    offer such a license for something less than this, but I guess most foundries
    may offer you a higher price. If you\u2019d like to get another offer, just let
    me know ;)"

  body: You don't mention the platforms you're targeting, but an additional consideration
    might be hinting quality, especially if your targeting Windows. You could easily
    spend thousands of dollars having a cheaper font hinted for optimal screen display.
