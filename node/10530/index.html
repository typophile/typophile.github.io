  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, <BR>I'm doing here and there (mostly by chance) a reseacrh of certain contemporary typefaces in use (almost all from the boom years of Emigre, the first middle of the 1990s). <BR>What intrigued me most was the use of a specific face (Jon Barnbrook Ma(n)son) in a widespread way but also unexpected situations: <BR>from the latest Barbie cartoons DVD to the novel &quot;I, Lucifer&quot;, to religious theatrical pieces posters; from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to a big (and embarassingly banal) Italian shopping center logotype. <BR> <BR>I would really love if you could drop me a line (and possibly the URL) when you see Manson used in unexpected (or even expected but good) ways. <BR> <BR>Other typefaces with a conceptual background (which users cannot guess from the face itself) I'm interested in seeing and collecting samples of their use are: <BR> <BR>Template Gothic (Emigre) <BR>Keedy Sans (Emigre) <BR>Exocet (Emigre) <BR>Democratica (Emigre) <BR>Prozac (Virus) <BR>Auferstehung (Linotype) <BR>Circumcision/CQN Molecular (T-26) <BR>Merlin (FontFont) <BR>Oneleigh (FontFont) <BR> <BR>Most of these may be seen by many people as &quot;novelty faces&quot; but part of them have been and are undoubtedly faces reflecting our times and the relationship with the emerging computer technology from the late 1980s early 1990s. <BR>In different ways, of course. <BR>Oneleigh (and Merlin), for example, I would be really interested to know if someone have used them in books or textsetting. <BR> <BR>Please, report freely also examples of any other face (expecially conceptual) used in an original or surprising way. <BR> <BR>Thank you SO much!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Sean! <BR>The use is quite strange (especially in those SoBe Suzuki imagery), even if the graphic design is not so original and it seems they've chosen manson for the &quot;mythical&quot; feeling it may give (here paired with a somewhat cheap oriental feeeling). <BR>It seems a quite &quot;superficial usage&quot; (like they often do with otherwise historical faces like Trajan) but it's interesting indeed.

		<div class="commentbody">Isaac, I'm really grateful. It's hard to nail down the samples I look for. Here in Italy we've had nice use of these faces but some of them I saw when I wasn't collecting samples yet. <BR>Could you tell me more about this book? It's not so clear from the cover: the man seems a friendly blend between St. Joseph and Santa Claus but I guess it's just a good christmas story. <BR>In case, could you send me a higher resolution scan in jpg? It seems enough interesting and unusual to fit in my project idea&hellip; <BR> <BR>I wonder why people feel always the urge to enlarge Democratica's initial letters when the face is meant to be unicase. Anyway, this comes most from amateurs, while in your sample the enlargement is moderate and works quite nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">this book is for grown-ups, although it's disguised as a children's book. <BR>i don't know if you have board books in italy. in case it's a purely north american <BR>phenomenon, board book are printed on very thick, almost cardboard like paper. <BR>it's like two sheets of 179 lb. (488 gsm)cover paper, each printed on one <BR>side with a glossy finish, and then stuck together. this particular <BR>book is about 5.25 by 5.75 inches and is 0.75 inches thick, yet has <BR>only 28 pages, including the covers. the point is the pages are very thick, <BR>made so chubby little baby hands can easily grab the pages and turn them. <BR>the book is about a man who builds a village to protect all of his <BR>children from the dangerous forest surrounding them. one of the kids <BR>finds a whole in the outer wall of the village and crawls through, <BR>gets lost, etc. the man comes and saves him, etc. it's obviously an allegory <BR>for the choices we make and how god will help us and all of that stuff. <BR>email me and let me know where i should send the high res images. btw, i <BR>think the designer should have left the title unicase instaed of faking <BR>the caps. it's just weird seeing it like that.</div>

And another big thank you to Isaac for sending me hi-res scans of the christmas book. <BR> <BR>This afternoon I've found with an incredible luck the poster for a &quot;Jasus Christ Superstar&quot; theatrical piece held in my city, Modena. Together with the Duncan novel cover they are a great example on how Manson is appealing to represent the most varied situations, being them ethical-related or not. <BR> <BR>Thanks to everyone's collaboration!!!</div>

My stupid &quot;star&quot; votes are not meant to be a real &quot;vote&quot; they're just to help you grasp what I'm looking for in particular. <BR> <BR>I have another great example in my collection: A book dustjacket by Mucca Design (NY) for Rizzoli (Italia). It's for the italian edition of the scientific essay &quot;Impossibilities&quot;, and it's the best use I've seen of Barry's ubiquitous face yet. <BR> <BR>The book (by famous scientist John D. Barrow) talks about the limitations of scientific thought (and of man's &quot;God complex&quot; in general), and this is echoed masterfully by the use of Template Gothic, designed by Barry in a deliberately &quot;irregular&quot; way to underline the imperfection and irregularity (and thus the limits) of this life.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First of all thank you all for your sympathy and kindness. You are helping me a lot, since I'm doing this research by chance, in spare time. <BR> <BR>Nathan: the dinosaur book is fantastic! Maybe Filosofia is not so conceptual (not in the way I meant) but this use is so unexpected I just love it! the two images you've scanned are *great* could you send me the same two in hi-res at <a href="mailto:claudioNOCRAP@docdesign.it"><a href="mailto:claudioNOCRAP@docdesign.it">claudioNOCRAP@docdesign.it</a></a> <BR>That's my work e-mail and I have DSL. Drop the NOCRAP line, Ive put it to avoid spam. <BR> <BR>Dave: Your post made me genuinely laugh. It's great how, when we refer to colleagues or occasional type friends to our close ones, assuming they are familiar with them. My mother has yet to figure out quite well who's Jonathan, who's Oded, who's Alan. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>The Aztec use is really interesting. <BR> <BR>Isaac: thank you so much for the card with Template Gothic. I think this is more an occasional use of the face, given is wide diffusion, than a conscious choice. Anyway I've downloaded the lowres. <BR> <BR>I keep using the stupid &quot;star-rate&quot; system to let you focus best on what I seek. <BR> <BR>thank you! thank you! thank you! <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;do you have any samples of ma(n)son from barbie packaging? my neice loves  <BR>the barbie fruit snacks, so i can easily scan a box for you if you need it. <BR> <BR>Isaac, I love you! I did not imagine they have used Manson in other products beside the Barbie DVD (and I wasn't even sure they did outside Italy). Here Rapunzel translates as Raperonzolo, which is one of the most ridiculous names you can find in Italian. I guessed the original german name would have been something like that. After all it's from an old fairy tale. Barbie just plays the role of the Princess. <BR> <BR>Please do send the hi-res scan. The size you've used here it's just fine: make it 300ppi and it would be A-OK. In fact I mean to showcase the DVD cover in big size. <BR>This is because in it the &quot;dreamy&quot; and &quot;fairytalish&quot; atmosphere is so strong contrasting with Manson in an incredible way. The logo is also clean (without nifty digital effects like I see in your cereal box) but the cereal box is an excellent addition. I need it anyway! <BR> <BR>Now you can send it to my thought mailbox (<a href="mailto:thoughtNOCRAP@nettuno.it"><a href="mailto:thoughtNOCRAP@nettuno.it">thoughtNOCRAP@nettuno.it</a></a>). Leave out the NOCRAP string, which I put to avoid spam engines. Now I have a DSL connection at home (sort of, it's pretty crappy). <BR> <BR>I wish to thank Nathan for sending the Dinosaur scans. I repeat my request to him anyway, to have the two beautiful interior pages as they appear in the low res above, and not cropped like the ones he sent me. <BR> <BR>Guys, you are really helping me! <BR>Thanks and love to you all. <BR> <BR>P.s. Nathan, you can use the thought address, too, for re-sending the two interior pages. <BR>There is no need to make them huge. Smaller files with a less lossy jpg compression would be better, in fact. <BR>Have you guys ever used proJPEG plug-in? It's *amazing* for the quality and compression. <BR>I have to see if they've released a OsX version.</div>
