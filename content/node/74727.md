  company which uses complex algorithms to place statistically favorable trades for
  clients. The client asked for a simple mark and strong, clean type.\r\n\r\nThe mark
  represents \"sine waves\" in the shape of an abstract \"M.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, how is
  the kerning?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/msp-typophile_4194.jpg]"

  body: "For psychological and aesthetic reasons (if not mathematic), I would make
    the descending curve smaller than the ascending ones.\r\nAlso, the type seems
    a little bit too rough."

  body: "The letterspacing (which is not kerning) could use some massaging. Look at
    the pairs of letters the repel each other the most, like the N-A-L, R-T-N and
    the R-S combinations. The white space created by those letters stand out among
    the tighter fitting letters. I would spread it out overall until the white spaces
    echo the current widest gaps. \r\n"
