body: "Hi Typophile community!\r\n\r\nHere I present a type design project - very
  first impressions. Small case and italic designed, some italics are being drawn
  roughly, some other are (for now) only oblique - that will change however, caps
  and numerals still to come. \r\n\r\nWould be great to have some c&c on it - thank
  you in advance.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/specimen_062_600_5731.jpg]"

  body: "I think this is a quirky-looking but potentially promising project. The s
    is a bit bothersome; the lower terminal looks a little weak and the letter is
    falling backwards.\r\n\r\nI think that the straight parts in a, e, d, b\u2014which
    are working well\u2014could be applied to p, g, q.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of the
    i, j curls; I don't think they disrupt the flow of the glyphs.\r\n\r\n-Eric MacLeod\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    are still not ok for me neither - I'm trying to improve the glyphs."

  body: "I was quite unsatisfied with the overall shapes, so am trying to redraw up
    from the sketches - love it more, it has something of personality as wall as the
    sketches - only lowercase for now.\r\n\r\nWould be good to get some feedback -
    thank you![img:sites/default/files/old-images/reka_sans_6459.gif]"
