    it was only voted for by saboteurs?

    Especially when it comes to a high valued company. Even though it looks lame that
    they do this kind of stuff I would be proud to take part in this competition and
    win. Even if I received no compensation whatsoever.\r\n\r\nBeing a designer of
    a logo that Adobe uses would compensate my effort enormously.\r\n\r\n(and looking
    at current results I think that sabotage is failing)."

    it is greedy? As in they cringe at a thought of paying few thousand to have a
    logo designed?\r\n\r\nRi-i-ight."

  body: "<cite>Not that I think anyone would, but please don't mock the designer,
    it's not the point...</cite>\r\n\r\nWhen throwing around notions of what is shameful
    it's worth bearing in mind that this method of protest hurts no-one but the unwitting
    individual whose logo design you have deemed to be a joke. It's bullying and is
    very unlikely to cause Adobe any sleepless nights.\r\n\r\nThere are better ways
    of educating people about spec work than resorting to mockery, implied or direct. "

    ignored.\r\n\r\nThey really blew it on this one. There are tons of really great
    designers doing some truly awesome stuff these days. And Adobe could have also
    taken a cue from hip happenin' companies like Absolut and BMW (et al) who have
    a natural corporate want to celebrate the association between a commissioned designer
    / artist and their product.\r\n\r\nWake up Warnock."

    submissions. Many pros have posted comments protesting the contest and made great
    arguments about the long-term damage of spec work. But, painfully few of the designers
    who submitted work get it - they reply by saying how excited they'd be to win.
    \r\n\r\nWorse, Adobe's site administrator has been replying to comments referencing
    <em>no-spec.com</em> by insisting it's \"not spec work\" because the payment is
    exposure.\r\n\r\nUgh. "
