  I have a question for the Masters...\r\n\r\nWhen I am picking out a typeface, I
  like to see my options. I like to see a sample of text in Myriad, Frutiger, Utopia,
  etc., all next to each other. \r\n\r\nI downloaded a demo of a program called FontTasteTester
  for Mac, but it expired (and being a cheapskate, I don't want to renew it...). It
  was also for the old OS.\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend a freeware program for Mac
  OS X that can display a chosen phrase or word in list form all the fonts available?
  \r\n\r\nThanks for your help, I look forward to posting more often!"

    body: You really should say what your "this" is, but it's FontExplorer, and a
      bit heavy of a program for his purposes. Although, if he needs all that functionality,
      it is useful.  They have a <a href=http://www.linotype.com/freedownload/tools/fontexplorer/FontExplorer-Setup.exe>Free
      PC Version</a> and <a href=http://www.linotype.com/freedownload/tools/fontexplorer/FontExplorer.sit>Free
      Mac Version</a> but at about 180 Mb each, it's a pretty big program.  A smaller
      program, only 658k, is a free version of Advanced Font Viewer called <a href=http://www.styopkin.com/details_free_and_easy_fonts_viewer.html>Easy
      Font Viewer</a>.  Still, I prefer <a href=http://www.styopkin.com/details_advanced_fonts_viewer.html>Advanced
      Font Viewer</a> and it is still small but powerful.  It's main feature is just
      what he's looking for.  A text box to type in the text you want to show in a
      particular font, and then a window that shows that text in all your fonts, listed
      neatly and quickly.

    need Word. Also not sure if they work on Mac Word. But there are likely alternatives
    for other WP's.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si "
