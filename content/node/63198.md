  body: "Even though it's been discussed before (here too: http://www.typophile.com/node/37315),
    that doesn't make the problem any less serious.  For linguists, language death
    represents an irretrievable loss.  We are forced to develop hypotheses based on
    limite data, but ideally we then test those hypotheses on as many different languages
    as possible to see if we've really understood something universal about language
    or not.  As a general rule (with the exception of pidgins/creoles) languages evolve
    slowly over thousands of years, and if they disappear, the features that are unique
    to them will likely never reemerge in our lifetime (nor for several subsequent
    generations, if ever).  If it happens that we have not discovered those unique
    features before a language disappears, we may lack crucial data that could otherwise
    inform and improve our flawed theories.\r\n\r\nFor minority language communities,
    the situation is even more serious, because of all of the culture that is inherent
    in their languages.  Many communities would like to bring back their languages
    to the extent that Hebrew, Welsh, or Maori have been revived, but that requires
    not only dedication and a critical mass of willing participants, but enough existing
    language resources so that the language can be learned and modernized.  Unfortunately,
    for many endangered languages there are insufficient resources to fully revive
    the language.\r\n\r\nI wish I had some easy answers to this perplexing situation,
    but at least folks are talking about it."
