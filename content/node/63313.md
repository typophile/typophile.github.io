body: "Sorry for the fact that I have already posted the same picture to ID this font,
  but needed to rename the subject line. I guess that Twitter did not seem to be an
  interesting topic. :-) Or nobody could ID it? :-(\r\n\r\nAnyway; the question is
  the same: what is this beautiful thing used for \"Follow\" and \"on Twitter\".\r\n\r\nI
  hope someone will answer this one. I am falling for this typeface SERIOUSLY and
  I would love to take a better look at it in different sizes, please help me to make
  that happen. \r\n"
