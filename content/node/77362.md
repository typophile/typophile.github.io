body: "Unfortunately I'm not able to describe this poster with typographic vocabulary,
  I attached the poster I found this typeface on, and a segmented image of the typeface
  I'm trying to name specifically. I ran it through \"what da font\" to no result,
  per usual findings. \r\n\r\nUnnecessary information: This poster was printed by
  MATER of Denver Colorado. A letterpress, screen printing, marketing firm. The poster
  is mostly self explanatory. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\nEB"

  body: To me, it looks like some effects (inline and a plain shadow are not so hard
    to reproduce) have been applied on [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008|Gotham]]
    or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/|Proxima Nova]]...
