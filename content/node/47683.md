  Latin scripts?\r\n\r\nI'm aware that InDesign CS3 does this on its own, and that
  the pango renderer (on Linux) also turns it on since version 1.17. Does anyone know
  anything else that supports it?\r\n"

    Office2007 do this for every script, not only Latin. But there is a catch, it
    applies 'locl' to default language system.\r\n\r\nIf you are asking about shaping
    with custom language (other than default), this Uniscribe version also provides
    new set of APIs allowing to apply client-supplied language tag. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"
