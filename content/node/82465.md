  Glyph palette to Photoshop: \r\nhttp://feedback.photoshop.com/photoshop_family/topics/glyphs_panel_for_the_love_of_god\r\n\r\nIt
  would be a good idea to go through the registration process (for those of you who
  don't have an account yet) and \"like\" that idea there, as well as leaving some
  comments. The more people support this, the higher it'll be prioritized in the development
  process. So please spread the word as well. \r\n\r\nI've already given my vote and
  comment there. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    question till CS3 isn't it? \r\nWe should also request a decent support for OT
    features ;)"
