  publication design, now do mostly Web design, but have little experience with logotypes.
  This one is for my own design company, in which I want to focus on more sophisticated,
  subtle &#40;less flashy&#41; Flash design. <BR> <BR>The logotype uses ITC New Baskerville.
  I added the &#34;tti&#34; ligature, and altered the descender on the &#34;g.&#34;
  And because it has to look good on screen, I flattened the bottoms of the baseline
  serifs &#40;to avoid blurry little curves&#41;. I&#39;m not sure about my kerning,
  or if my modifications have broken any rules of good typographic design. Any feedback
  would be truly appreciated. <BR> <BR>Note: Please be patient if it takes some time

  body: 'Do you really want to convey such a conservative attitude? If you do, I think
    Baskerville is a great choice. But you might consider livening it up, maybe by
    doing something with the descender of the &#34;g&#34; &#40;noting that it&#39;s
    the only descender&#41;. But please no swoosh.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>The bar in the
    &#34;tti&#34; ligature looks a bit stiff. Try making it taper, thinner on the
    left, and &#40;optically&#41; matching the normal head serif shape on the right.
    <BR> <BR>The dot&#40;s&#41; on the &#34;i&#34;&#40;s&#41; are too high, and maybe
    slightly too small. <BR> <BR>I think I like the &#34;k&#34;, but I&#39;m not sure.

  body: 'Thanks so much, Hrant, for the thoughtful and useful feedback. I couldn&#39;t

    alt="mattiklogo2">  <BR>The result is very pleasing to me, and I just may go with
    this as my logotype, for I think it conveys sophistication, and the ability to
    use traditional elements in contemporary ways. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t want to appear
    boring or uncreative, however, so I tried a multitude of approaches to liven it
    up, including many variations on the descender of the &#34;g&#34; &#40;avoiding
    swashes&#41;. Everything looked contrived, and any additional element detracted
    from the beauty of the letterforms. <BR> <BR>Finally, I tried merely moving one
    element: the dot on the 2nd &#34;i&#34;:  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12535.jpg"
    alt="mattiklogo-eye"> <BR>This definitely adds playfulness and interest, but I
    wonder if it&#39;s too cute, or if it too closely resembles another logo. I think
    it implies an examining eye, which is foundational to good design. It would also
    lend itself to a Flash treatment, which is appropriate for a designer seeking
    to specialize in Flash websites. But does it look good? Forgive me if this diverges
    too much from typography to graphic design and other considerations...  <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    I&#39;d be grateful for any additional feedback or suggestions--from you or from
    any others in the forums--regarding either of the above logotypes, or alternate
    suggestions for adding interest/distinction to my basic logotype. Thanks so much!  --Jim

    could be to move the dot slightly to the right, but I am not sure if there is
    enough place to do that &#40;the dot in the centre of the counter probably wouldn&#39;t
    work so well&#41;. Another solution: Make the dot black. This solution makes some

    maybe the dot could just &#34;jump&#34; towards the &#34;g&#34; but remain above

    the very literal representation of animation in my previous version was annoying,

    Hrant&#39;s suggestion &#40;which Tanya and Matjaz seemed to like&#41; to leave
    both dots off, or the meaning of &#34;a secondary animated effect.&#34; Maybe
    it&#39;s to keep the &#34;straight&#34; form for print, and save playing with
    the dots for online animation? Or was it really to take all the dots off for print,
    like this?: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12588.jpg"
    alt="mattiklogo - no dots"> <BR>Or was something altogether different being suggested?
    <BR> <BR>I did try the &#34;slightly off&#34; idea of Matjaz, but the results
    of that irritated me too. &#40;Though maybe in more skilled hands...?&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Perhaps I&#39;m being indulgent messing with these dots; my original intent
    was for a clean, simple, appealing logotype, and now I&#39;m trying to get it
    to do too much. If I really want to imply animation in print, I should probably
    design a logo from scratch for that purpose. <BR> <BR>So, unless there&#39;s a
    good idea I haven&#39;t explored, it seems I should just stop messing with the
    dots for print, and go with the straightforward version. If I can find an appropriate
    way online to introduce animation &#40;and I now see several possibilities&#41;,
    I can do that later, and can change it more easily than the printed stuff. &#40;But
    if anyone still wants to give/clarify dot suggestions, I&#39;ll of course consider
    them.&#41; <BR> <BR>What I&#39;d finally like to ask--and this is actually why
    I originally started this forum, so pardon the dot sidetracking--is if anyone
    sees any &#42;typographic&#42; problems remaining with the logotype. Hrant and
    a few friends have helped me get some of my major problems fixed, so from a purely
    typographic standpoint, is it good to go? <BR> <BR>David Hamuel wondered why I
    did the &#34;tti&#34; ligature. Maybe for any of you to evaluate what I&#39;ve
    done, it would be good for me to show the &#34;raw&#34; type &#40;1, below&#41;
    so you can compare it with what I&#39;ve done &#40;2, below&#41;. The raw type
    is ITC New Baskerville, set in Illustrator with reduced tracking, but no hand
    kerning. Here they are:  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12589.jpg"
    alt="mattiklogo -process"> <BR>So, keeping in mind that on-screen appearance takes
    priority, is there anything else you hard-core type experts see in this thing
    that needs to be fixed? Be amicably ruthless, please. <BR> <BR>Again, sincere
    thanks to previous &#40;and any future&#41; contributors. A deadline may keep
    me away for a day or so, but I&#39;ll be back then to respond to any new offerings.  --Jim

    matter how I did it. And I appreciate you pointing out the &#34;empty space&#34;
    above the second i; my clients usually say they want designs with lots of white
    space, so I think it&#39;s good that my logo suggests a sense of empty space.
    <BR> <BR>Matjaz--  It&#39;s really good that you spotted that fat descender on
    the g. When I did my initial work before my first post, I made several modifications
    to reduce the onscreen distortion caused by antialiasing my vector art, which
    was the worst in Flash. These mods were the things I felt the most insecure about
    presenting to typographers, and I wondered if anyone would notice. I think you&#39;re
    the first &#40;in 34 posts&#41; to mention any of this! I actually imaged that
    this topic of modifying type to look good onscreen with antialiasing &#40;not
    a pixel font&#41; might generate the most discussion in my thread. <BR> <BR>I
    mentioned right up front that I had changed the baseline serifs &#40;removing
    their bottom &#34;dimples&#34;&#41;. The g &#40;my more open version as well as
    the Baskerville&#41; was tending to get a flat section on the bottom of the descender,
    and thickening it seemed to counteract this. But if it&#39;s bad typography, I
    want to change it. I tried to compromise with the g in version 8 &#40;a &amp;
    b&#41; above. How does that look? <BR> <BR>I had the same &#34;flattening&#34;
    problem with the top of the &#34;a,&#34; and did a similar fattening of the stroke.
    But after the scrutiny inspired by your observation, I tried to thin that back
    up in this last version &#40;above&#41;, although the letterform is still somewhat
    different in an attempt to reduce its antialias mess. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a comparison
    of how Flash rendered the outlines of the raw Baskerville &#34;a&#34; and my new
    compromise &#34;a&#34;: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12753.jpg"
    alt="&#34;a&#34;s in Flash"> <BR>But the logo will also appear in print, so I
    don&#39;t want to do anything too weird in compensating for antialias distortion.
    So, I&#39;m hoping my new &#34;a&#34; stands on its own as a halfway decent letterform.
    Please look at the two &#34;a&#34;s enlarged &#40;below&#41;, and let me know
    what you think: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12754.jpg"

    color, and would like a variety of respondents. Is this forum appropriate for
    that? Thanks.  --Jim <BR>  <BR> <BR> '

  body: David--  I appreciate your feedback. Glad you agree with Keith and Darrel,
    as I took that route of not trying to indicate animation, and removing the dots.
    <BR> <BR>As for Hrant&#39;s question about conservative, in my second post I guess
    I only implied an answer by saying I didn&#39;t want to appear boring or uncreative,
    so would try various things to liven it up. &#40;This lead to all the variations
    that finally culminated in the basic design of version 7.&#41; <BR> <BR>I think
    if conservative in this context means uncreative, I definitely don&#39;t want
    that. If, however, working creatively with existing elements in a non-radical,
    subdued/subtle way is considered conservative, then yes, that&#39;s something
    I&#39;d like to realize &#40;in my work and my logo&#41;. I really like the beauty
    of classic serif faces, and I wanted to try to use one in a way that was clean
    and somewhat contemporary. Since I work mostly with architects who often think
    sans serifs like Futura or Helvetica are the only way to have clean, &#34;structural&#34;
    type, it would be nice if my logo implied other creative possibilities for designing
    for architectural concerns. <BR> <BR>And to be honest, I&#39;m so in over my head
    reworking these letterforms, and I&#39;ve already devoted so much time to it,
    that at this point I&#39;ll settle for something that isn&#39;t ugly, avoids clich

    Flash renders cubic beziers &#40;the kind Postscript uses, in fonts, EPS, etc.&#41;

    So try importing your logo into Fontogapher or FontLab &#40;preferably the latter&#41;

    as version 10 is basically the final version, I was asking above for any final
