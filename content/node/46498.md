  body: "@typerror: <em>And as to the thick/thin disparity I was merely trying to
    say that the thins are much heavier than Zapf would have done! It has been altered
    as well.</em>\r\n\r\nAssuming Zapf did it. What if it isn't altered Zapfino, but
    merely a few glyphs that look like altered Zapfino? \r\n\r\n<em>You were just
    pulling my leg, right?</em>\r\n\r\nNot really. I just think it's wise not to jump
    to obvious conclusions based on visual evidence alone. We don't know the Zapfino
    theory is true, we only assume it is. It's one thing to overlay a sample on top
    of glyphs from a particular font and say \"it was made out of this but modified\"
    on account of the similarities, and it's another thing to acquire and provide
    proof that that is indeed what actually happened.\r\n\r\n@Nick Cooke: <em>I think
    you\u2019re wrong James - Michael is right; Zapfino is the starting point.\r\n\r\nThis
    is done with outset paths, a bit of skewing here and there and no other manipulation.
    \r\n\r\nA bit more refinement and you\u2019re there.</em>\r\n\r\nYour overlay
    drawing proves nothing other than the similarities between the glyphs in the I.D
    sample and Zapfino 1. It does not prove Zapfino was the starting point. I looked
    at Zapfino 1 as well, compared the sample, and concluded it may have been derived
    from Zapfino, or maybe not. Either way, all you've got is speculation based on
    what you want to believe, what you want reality to be.\r\n\r\nWhoever made the
    sample glyphs could have drawn them that way by eye using a sample of Zapfino.
    I could have done it by eye with a sample on-screen or printed and taped to the
    shadow mask of the screen. Any competent bezier wrangler could have done it by
    eye.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying it wasn't made out of Zapfino. All I'm saying is we
    don't <em>know</em> it was with certainty. The overwhelming similarities could
    be coincidental.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm playing devil's advocate too. Somebody has to.\r\n\r\nj

  body: "I just tried playing around with Zapfino Forte and Zapfino One, and adding
    stroke thickness approaches the sample, but the stroke details are wrong, as are
    the angles. When I tried adding  negative shear the M was too skewed if I got
    close with the I's. I also tried using path offsets with the outlines, and that
    was closer in some respects, but still had the wrong calligraphic stroke details.\r\n\r\nMy
    inclination, based on my crude attempts, is to say that someone skilled in calligraphy
    might quite easily imitate the forms of Zapfino, but not without imparting their
    own signature technique. That's what I suspect we are seeing. \r\n\r\nIf your
    goal is to approximately replicate this, then I agree with using Zapfino as a
    starting point, unless you have the calligraphic skill to imitate it.  Unless
    you match them side by side, I think it would be hard to describe the differences.\r\n\r\n-
