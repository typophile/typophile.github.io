  Daft Punk in their One More Time single cover. The font is called \"WatchMNOutline_,\"
  but all the version I have found don't have lowercase letters. If anyone can make
  the uppercase letters the lowercase ones as well,  it would be perfect. Also, here
  are some covers for reference-\r\n<img>http://www.dafont.com/forum/attach/orig/2/6/264862.jpg
