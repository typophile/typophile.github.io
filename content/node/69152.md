body: The example I include here is of a particular font that seems to me to be of
  the Garalde style of typeface. I've seen this typeface in a few books over the years,
  but I have never been able to track it down on the internet on my own or even find
  out its name. Can anyone here help me? Thanks in advance.

  body: No, it isn't Bembo. The uppercase R is different (please see new attachment).

    the long tail, Bembo always had a short tail version*. It's just that whoever
    digitised it choose to use the long-tailed R as a default.\r\n\r\n* see here (glyph

  body: That's good to know, riccard0. I often choose not to use Bembo because I find
    that tail in the R to be too distracting and difficult to work with in text.
