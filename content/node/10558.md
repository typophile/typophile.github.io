  etc... <BR> <BR>I have checked H&amp;FJ Whitney, but that&#39;s not it - just look
  at &#34;e&#34; and &#34;C&#34;. &#40;When did they stop using H&amp;FJ whitney anyway?&#41;
  <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a pretty crude scan &#40;it has an unusual comma and diamond-shaped
  punctuation&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70751.jpg"

  body: Zemestro is Farey&#39;s watered-down version of Cachet.  <BR>The disappointing
    &#34;renewal&#34; of the previous face was  <BR>intended to be more usable, but
    it just ends up boring.
