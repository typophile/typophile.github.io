  body: '&#34;has the accessibility symbol&#34; <BR> <BR>That&#39;s not an accessibility
    symbol. It&#39;s a &#39;handicapped&#39; symbol or &#39;wheelchair accessible&#39;
    symbol.  <BR> <BR>accessibility &#62; physical disability. I&#39;d seriously consider
    trying to come up with your own if you can. Check out what Apple use&#39;s for
    their icon.  <BR> <BR>I co-opted it for a quick icon on our site: <BR><a href="http://www.courts.state.mn.us/"
    target="_blank">http://www.courts.state.mn.us/</a> <BR> <BR>Now, if you&#39;re
    trying to design a sign for handicapped parking, then it makes a lot of sense,
    but for accessibility in general, not so much.'

  body: Well, I guess I&#39;m lost unless I know a bit more about the context of situation.
    My point was that using the wheelchair symbol is not a good icon for the broader
    concept of &#39;accessibility&#39; outside of the basic handicapped parking space
    and wheelchair ramp.

  body: Darrel, <BR>I think the clue was in the question, [accessibility symbol &#40;guy
    on chair :P&#41;], which led me to my suggestion, but it was an ungracious remark
    by inversarium to someone who was trying to help him/her. On the other hand I
    don&#39;t think the icon you pointed to would have indicated accessibility without
    the word next to it. <BR>Tim

  body: 'Tim: <BR> <BR>I agree that the icon I linked to in no way is a great icon
    for accessibility. But it&#39;s arguably much better than the wheelchair icon.
    <BR> <BR>The main issue is that accessibility is so much more than just accomodating
    physical impairements and the wheelchair icon just carries a lot of baggage with
    it that doesn&#39;t really fit into the whole accessibility concept. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    love to see push for more a universally agreed upon standard for accessibility
    rather than just the wheelchair.'

    sits right with the other symbols in Photoshop 7 default shapes and it&#39;s only
    now that I notice it! Anyways, thought i&#39;d share the alternative to the font
