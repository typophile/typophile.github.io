  discussions are always informative and entertaining!\r\n\r\n\r\nSo here is my project,
  I am helping a friend open a Brazilian jiu-jitsu company based inside a local gym.
  I have not created a logo since college. and I am struggling with getting this to
  look right. I am hoping you can help throw-out some ideas on what direction I can
  take on this? Dont be nice jsut let me have it.\r\n\r\nHere are some really rough
  comps:\r\n\r\nthe first 2 are ideas from the \"client\" that I have digitized, The
  others are me playing with what they gave me. The colors are not approved or final
  just trying different things.\r\n\r\nType faces being used:\r\nBerlinsans\r\nDaleysGothic\r\n\r\nAgain
  these are not approved and can change... \r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nThis \"jiu-jitsu\"
  class will be for male and female currently adults of all ages and later kids will
  have classes as well. These classes will be geared towards more \"staying in shape,
  and toning muscle\" NOT FIGHTING I think this is the part where I am having issues
  targeting the market and making it appeal that way... any way let me know what you
  think!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    how it looked... so that's why its there, I already know that looks really bad.
