    called 'Roco', shown in the Dan Solo 'Art Deco' book published by Dover.\r\n\r\nMany
    of the Art Deco digitizations I know were done by Nick Curtis. If 'Old Nick' is
    hanging around he could probably tell you right away.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    one of the two A's that are shown in the Solotype book.\r\n\r\nA quick look through
    Nick Curtis's fonts didn't show this one, so that might be your best bet for a
    digital version.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "On further comparison, I would say Stephen said it right -- they are 'similar'.
    Most letters are the same, but there are a number of differences, including the
    S. The P22 font is clearly based on Roco, but that's about it. 'Roco' does match
    every character of the sample, except for the A.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    (p. 49), and it does match the A of the sample. So 'Right Bank' is based on Grock?\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Mike - I'm pretty sure that it is, as you first said, Roco. Most of Grock's
    letterforms are considerably narrower. Just compare the two S's in the Solotype
    Catlaog.\r\n\r\nI should say that it is <em>mostly</em> Roco. Casady & Greene
    always tweaked their \"versions\" of existing fonts a bit. I'm not sure if Roco
    had that A (or Jeff Levine's) as an alternate (Homage to the Alphabet doesn't
    show an alt) or if it was purely a C&G modification.\r\n\r\nThere's also Fontbank's
    <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/lullaby.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Lullaby</a>,
    but it lacks Roco's original 5 as used in the poster's image. Right Bank is the
    only font I'm aware of that fully matches up."

  body: "My notes on Lullaby show Right Bank as the equivalent, but I think you're
    right that Roco was the original. Levine's 'Regal Suite' mirrors Roco, including
    both A's shown in the Dover book (but not 'Homage'), and the big 5. It seems the
    A with sloped sides is the C&G 'innovation' ('tweak', as you said).\r\n\r\nWith
    all these versions floating around it was no wonder it looked familiar right away.\r\n\r\n-
