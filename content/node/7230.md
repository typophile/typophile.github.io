    handled it.

    The story has been extensively covered in the UK press, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll
    be able to find more.

  body: Thanks Robin, do they only have a salad shot or is it a campaign

  body: I believe it&#39;s a campaign. &#40;Haven&#39;t actually seen any of the ads
    - only read about them!&#41; Obviously there won&#39;t be any shots of burgers
    and fries. According to the <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=14748945&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50143">Mirror</a>,
    the posters feature &#34;wholesome images of lettuce leaves, frothy coffee and
    free range eggs&#34;. Don&#39;t think it&#39;ll convince me to go there!

  body: It is a billboard campaign featuring a large image on a white background,
    with black type and a hand drawn question mark - &#40;not part of a typeface&#41;
    in the same colour as the golden arches, all quite understated. Typography by
    Mark Cakebread, Leo Burnett, London. <BR>What is all this about a closely guarded
    McFont? - it doesn&#39;t exist. Anyone can buy Houschka. <BR>I may have a pdf
    soon...
