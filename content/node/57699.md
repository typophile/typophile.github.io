  used Telidon Ink font for something similar. This one however has serifs although
  still printed...I think it was pulled from an old Apple database in the 90s but
  that's all I know. Help !!!"

    replicate this mechanical printer built-in 'font'by scanning the letters (FontFont
    seems to do it all the time), you will probably not find this in digital form.\r\n\r\n-

  body: So there's nothing closer than Telidon ?! It doesn't really need to look like
    it was printed as long as the font looks the same.
