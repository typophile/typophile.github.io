  body: "I like it.\r\n\r\nA few small observations; the top of the 'a' seems a bit
    too light. The 'c' looks wide compared to 'o', 'd', etc., same goes for the 'e'.
    Maybe the 's' is a bit bottom-heavy. I'll take a better look at it when I have
    more time.\r\n\r\nOh and please try to post in English, otherwise many of us don't
    know what you are saying. ;)"

    for your comment. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Imagen-10_5591.jpg]\r\n\r\nHope
    you have more time to take a second look because I realy need some feedback. I
    been working on this for so long that I get used to see it, and that make me hard
    to find the problems. \r\n\r\n(sorry for my poor English)"

    Why don't you have \xF1 in the specimen? I'll take a look at the sample and give
    you more comments later."

    yet. I still have much to do on diacritics, ligatures and non alphabetical characters
    (never ends)."
