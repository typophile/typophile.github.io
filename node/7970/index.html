		<div class="commentbody">Ken, justifing that much text copy is hard to read. Make it Flush Left, Rag Right. Also (if you can) allow for some hypenation for better color. The banking industry here doesn't allow hypenation. You might also look into making a two column layout. Remember most people read newspapers and magazines and they generally don't have wide columns. Just because the logo is in a sans serif face it doesn't mean you can't have a serif face for the body copy. I would think the separation would help the communication. Think again about newspapers and magazines. <BR> <BR>One last thought the 97% ad is unreadable with the body text like that. Its also inconsistant with your other image ads. How about getting a picture of a rig and in photoshop put the 97% on the trailer of the rig. Reinforce that its about ground transportation.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, I made all the changes that I understood and just uploaded 3 versions of them.  The first I columnized the layout and then went with a serif font just to see how it would look.  The second is a column that just uses dax-light again and the Vito advertisement is flush left, rag right like you suggested.  I columized the first two because their copy was larger than the other &quot;person envy&quot; ads. <BR> <BR>Of the two column layouts, which do you think is better?

		<div class="commentbody">Now Ken I have one more bone to pick with your ads. Way too much copy. You need to tease the reader into action. In this case either calling the toll-free number or going to the web site. At the web site or the telephone operators can give the full story. Also I'm confussed do you only handle ground traffic or air traffic as well? If you handle air traffic you somehow have to make that clear too.  <BR> <BR>I like the two column format but not the justification. To justify copy it creates wholes throughout the paragraphs as letter spacing and word spacing is compromised to make it flush. Thats why the color of Flush left, rag right copy reads better. I don't think it matters if the serif has any relationship with Dax, the body text is not the logo and should probably be kept separate from it. Keep up the good work</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ken, <BR>This is some good work. As a first comment I would make sure that you do not use double word spaces after a full point (or in any other place) this will improve the colour of your type, for certain combinations . W and . T it is worth kerning the space to help. As pointed out justified type can be a bit of a trial, for example, in your first (and to a lesser extent in the second) the second line of the righthand column is a bit spacy, if you are in a position to rewrite/have rewritten to suit that might help, or there is no reason that the two columns couldn't be different widths. To aid readers and potential clients I would try to get all three elements of the date in the same line. In the second layout the leading in the righthand column is not the same as that of the left not being the same results in an ugly step. To get picky, if you have a full point or comma at the end of a line in justified text it can make a step in the righthand vertical margin, an easy way to deal with this is to insert a white (or the same colour as the background) full point/comma at the end of each line to create hanging punctuation (remember that you have done this when it comes to changing/updating a piece of text). I might consider moving the logo so that the t of Connect aligned with the righthand margin of the body copy. <BR>Tim</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all the comments everyone.  Here are the next versions of the ads that incorporate everyone's comments. <BR> <BR>I didn't move the logo so that the 't' lined up with the right side of the second column because then it makes a big uneven space on the right side of the ad.  Either I move the paragraph over so it's not centered you the tagline is too far to the right :/  I noticed this before when I was positioning things earlier before the comment but wanted to try it again.  I don't see how it could work.  I do realize now after looking at it that something is still odd about it but I printed one of the ads and it looks better when its aligned with the tagline. <BR> <BR>I just picked the proforma serif font.  I used the light version and the semi-bold for the website, phone, etc.  Your right Dan, once printed I can read the text much better.  It also gave it this rich kind of feel that I wouldn't have expected and got this warm feeling that it started to actually look like an advertisement. <BR> <BR>I made sure the punctuation is hanging.  This was a great comment and I would have never saw this on my own.  It's a good thing my program has an option for it actually so I didn't have to add in those extra white periods at the end of each line. <BR> <BR>Also Tim, I removed the double spaces.  It looks weird on the screen actually, but the space is very adequate once it's printed.  I'll make sure to not double space after sentences anymore.  That's a good tip. <BR> <BR>I never even realized the problem with the leading on the first ad.  Again, this is just stuff I'd never notice unless I was taught.  Thanks so much for that because after looking at it, it's kind of embarassing.  Told you I was not a designer <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>I'm actually marveled at how you guys can see a problems with the line &quot;employee, but also because her company uses&quot; because again, that just didn't jump out at me.  I'll have to internalize a lot of these techniques for future works.  Very useful.  The problem is still there, but I'll remove it once I reword the text so that &quot;BorderConnect&quot; is on the same line. <BR> <BR>The one thing I didn't do was flush left the columns as Dan had suggested, mainly because the right column looked weird with &quot;BorderConnect&quot; on the next line.  I think the rest of sentences actually look fine besides that though.  I think I just have to reword it to make justification or the flush left to work correctly. <BR> <BR>Lastly, and probably most importantly, I shrunk all the copy by a few lines.  You'd notice that more if you compared these new versions as single-column layouts like the original ads.  I think the columnization and the extra leading makes it even appear as less text too.  I also started to use the active voice a bit more, as one copywriter website had suggested. <BR> <BR>I think the problem with the service that we are providing is that a lot of carriers don't really know what it is, so it's imperative to give them some use-cases to visualize what the software can do in their minds.  At least, that's what we try to do on the phone when selling to potential customers and the hit rates are higher.   <BR> <BR>We also don't have any competitors really, so we can't say our solution is &quot;faster&quot;, &quot;safer&quot;, &quot;cheaper&quot;, etc. like other brands can.  We also don't have a point of reference like normal products do (like cars, etc.). <BR> <BR>Anyway, here are the new versions and let me know what you think.  Thanks again for all the amazing comments.   You guys astonish me all the time. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/55095.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/55096.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/55097.jpg" alt=""> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/55098.jpg" alt=""></div>

No one will take the ad and compare it to the website. Its two different kinds of media. Just make sure the message is the same. Have you considered changing the photos to a duotone or tritone.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks again for all the great feedback Dan and Tim.  I think I get the general principles associated with justification.  I'm finding it fairly easy to fake justification with the flush left, ragged right by changing words around and adding hyphens.  However, if I can fake it, making it justified actually looks pretty good too, so I guess you can use flush left, ragged right as a guide to perfecting it the spacing problems and then justify it afterwards.  I think the justified look is superior visually, but I also see the problems with letter and word spacing, so I want to have the best of both worlds. <BR> <BR>I went back to my old fast company magazines and it seems that 65% of the ads justify their text (single or two-colomn layouts) and 35% don't.  I noticed that certain advertisements like car ads (most), Microsoft, HP, etc. will not justify any of their text while others will.  In most cases where I saw justified text, they fixed the problems with word spacing, however some companies did not.  Interesting enough, the large companies with a lot of advertising dollars did it right and the no-name brands did it wrong.  After thinking about everything you guys have been teaching me, it has become glaringly obvious now. <BR> <BR>I have incorporated all the suggestions up to this point, so here is an update.  I tried looking at display fonts, but everything I try on my computer looks bad.  I realized that italizing really makes things look better though, although I don't really know why (don't understand the psychology).  What are some good display faces that you'd recommend Daniel? <BR> <BR>Also, is it really that obvious that pictures look like stock photos?  Is that a bad thing?  I have taken some real digital photos of our customers actually (in the office, on the road, in the lots, at the border, etc.) and I could use those.   <BR> <BR>So duotone, tritone and quadtone images are the way to go?  I have not read any articles even mentioning the benefits and disadvantages to doing this, so I don't really know much about it.  In fact, it never even occured to me.  I have seen some ads in black/white, like those from salesforce.com or omnisky, HP, IBM (and many others), as well as some quadtone pictures from Doilette and Touche.  I also see full-color images too, like every ad from Microsoft, although I guess that's understandable with their XP, Office and MSN campaigns, where all of their brands have multiple bright colours of red, yellow, blue and green.  I'm not really sure what the strategy or general principles are here. <BR> <BR>Anyway, here are some updates.  I'm still not liking the display fonts as mentioned earlier.  I tried to use the same font for the subheads as the headlines, but it just doesn't look right to me. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/55155.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ken the point about the stock photos is you ad will get lost in publications that use stock photos. In your first Aynsley ad loose the &quot;walk 30 minutes through snow&quot; even if it was true it sounds like a scare tactic. Only stress benefits not consenquences. The reason for using display faces is to sort of shock the eye not nessicerely please the eye. They ad a uniqueness to your look. I suggest looking at one of the Indie Font books for inspiration, check a library or contact P22 fonts. There are two volumns. Ken you haven't told me if your software is for drivers only or does it also work with air traffic? If it works with air traffic also make it clear it does at least in one ad. If it only ground traffic make that painfully  clear.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The software is just for ground.  To be honest, I don't even know how customs does air traffic, but I'm assuming they release the shipment when the plane takes off or lands, or both.  Either way, that really doesn't have much to do with the actual release offices. <BR> <BR>Customs hasn't exactly told us what the messages are capable of either but we have many ground carriers using the system and we built the software with the intention of providing a service for ground carriers only.  I'd actually have to ask customs and sign up an air carrier to see what kind of messages the government is sending us to verify if it can work with air traffic.  That might sound kind of weird, but the specifications for connecting software with customs is extremely poor and are filled with all kinds of mistakes and missing inforamtion (both technical and even high-level information). <BR> <BR>But I'm not really sure why this can be confusing because when I think of the border, I think of the ports of entry into Canada/US.  When I think of border problems, I think of excessively long lineups miles long and drivers being sent away to customs compounds in frustration when the shipments aren't properly cleared by the customs broker.  Those are the problems are software solves. <BR> <BR>I can make it abundantly clear that its international ground carriers I guess and start showing more trucks (as you suggested).  I have some pictures of directions and vps next their trucks actually smiling into the camera.  I also have some drivers in various pictures in and out of their trucks.  I can use those but they aren't really professional pictures although Photoshop might be able to fix that problem. <BR> <BR>I'll take out the &quot;30 minutes in the snow&quot; part then.  The fact is true though.  In Winnipeg, Manitoba it snows more often than when I live and it can get fairly deep.  A lot of times when the truck is forced to stop at the border, the driver has to walk to a customs broker at a compound.  If that's in the snow, it usually makes a lot of drivers really pissed off if you can imagine.  That's more of a location-specific problem because here in Windsor, Ontario, we don't have that problem really.  That's actually why certain ads need to target certain locations.  In Windsor, it's the long lineups and so on as it's the busiest border-crossing in the entire world believe it or not. <BR> <BR>So would you suggest of taking some custom photos and keep them in full-color?  Or is the general principle to always use duotone to make them standout from the other ads?  When you say, &quot;get lost in publications that use stock photos&quot;, I guess I'm not really sure what the means.  A lot of ads use stock photos and are full color, so I never noticed a problem with it (but I obviously am not an expert and I don't know the benefits and disadvantages to each approach). <BR> <BR>I'm looking at p22 right now.  I'm not terribly impressed with them but I'll look through them all.  Hopefully I find something that catches my eye. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for your comments Dan, as always.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ken, don't just go by statistics x% does this or that. Following the lead of the flock mentality will make sure you look like one of the sheep. Tell me you can see the difference in a flock of sheep. Use your custom photos if you can, the only reason I mentioned duotones is to set your ad apart from the look of the editorial work or other ads. You could do any other device to make you ads unique: a border around the photo, a transistion from black and white to full color, float the photo and fade the edges to white.  <BR> <BR>Also check out Font Bureau <BR> <BR>Ken rule of thumb. Express one idea, keep the copy short, have a call to action, no negitives.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As regards the type, for an ad, I try to avoid hyphens more than wide spacing, for a good example look at your second Aynsley ad where, on three occasions the hyphenated word is a word of itself. Avoid a single word on the last line, it looks lost. BTW I had no objection to the sans versions.  <BR>I believe that Dan was saying that stock photography is generic and will appear in a publication containing lots of ads also using stock images (and, on occasion, the same shot can be used by another company). A designer might recognise the source but I doubt that most of your potential clients would have the same reaction and I think your confusion over the comment underlines that. There is no general principle with stock photography</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ken, it's cool that you are looking through other ads and comparing justification and making observations. That attention to detail will really help you out if this is something you continue to do. <BR> <BR>If you don't mind me jumping in late, I can add some suggestions to Tim &amp; Daniel's already very helpful ones.   <BR> <BR>With Vito &amp; Jack, the line length is much too long. 113 characters is almost twice the &quot;maximum&quot; for optimal readability. The two-column layouts are much more pleasing and won't overwhelm your readers. People (who read correctly) read by grouping up phrases from line to line, but this is impossible with long line lengths. Try aiming for around 45-66 characters, includings spaces. <BR> <BR>I think it's really nice that you haven't added space between lines AND indented new paragraphs. Usually people do that all the time, and it's unnecessary. Congrats! (and thank you.) <BR> <BR>Proforma has a set of small caps, and since you are using all caps with FREE and AMPS, it would be extra nice to set these in small caps. <BR> <BR>For Jack, should the headline end with a period? <BR> <BR>For Aynsley1 (the first one), you might also want to hang the punctuation in the photo descriptions after the names. Since the captions are shorter, some people might purposefully leave them the way you have them. Your line count (or depth) shouldn't vary by just one or two. When you are lining things up, you either want to have them align perfectly, or create enough of a difference that it makes a healthy contrast. <BR> <BR>For the two column layouts, it looks like you have matched the space between columns with the space between paragraphs. You might want to consider bringing the columns a little bit closer. This will make them feel more unified as a section of copy. Now, there's also something called rivers. This is where white space runs up through a paragraph. Subconsciously they can be distracting, and they kill the color for paragraphs. It can happen when the same word falls in the same position on two consecutive lines (the first aynsley ad, second column, the word &quot;her&quot;) or it can occur randomly just because. If you spot them, you can try to reword sentences. It happens more in justified settings because sentences stretch out to fit, creating more space, and it might be another reason Daniel is suggesting left-aligned ragged right. <BR> <BR>If it's possible, the dates would look better if you can keep from breaking them up. Might not be possible, but if you are able to rewrite things, it would flow much better. Tim mentioned this previously. <BR> <BR>Stock photography is really tricky. In the future, look for pictures with eye contact and not a lot of background clutter. The two photos with eye contact are so much more dynamic, and even makes it seem like these people are actually telling you their story. In the second Aynsley photo, the cluttered desk makes her look disorganized and the red cup draws too much attention. In a directed photo, you would have been able to remove it and put meaningful objects in the background. <BR> <BR>This is just something I noticed, and I'm not trying to say anything, but it's all white people. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> It seems like the border might be a little more controlled than you think! Just teasing. Some diversity might help though. <BR> <BR>Lastly, in the tagline, do you need the word &quot;Because?&quot; Might want to just have &quot;Borders were made for crossing.&quot; <BR> <BR>Hope you found these comments useful! Your revisions so far are looking good.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the comments Brian. You mentioend several good points that I'm going to implement.  I've actually been reading Ogilvy On Advertising and Robert Bly's Copywriting handbook, which repeatedly hammers on some of the points that you have mentioned. <BR> <BR>I have actually read some material that conflicts to what is being said here too by Dan and Tim, and that is what is on my mind right now.  Namely: <BR> <BR>1. There seems to be a principal to use shorter copy, however Ogivly is pro-long copy and Bly offers some good principles that let you choose, which also lead to long copy for my service. <BR> <BR>2. Duotone or other effects on photos.  Ogivly hasn't shown one advertisement where he edits the photo.  They are all full-color photos with bleeding that are positioned in three or four spots every time.  I think they look nice and it was the effect I was going for even before I knew about Ogilvy.  He belives that the more you make them look like an article from the magazine, the more people are inclined to read it.  It's also more readable from his research. <BR> <BR>Bly says these that by tinting the photo, doing fancy arrows or &quot;addy&quot; kind of design elements, you lose readership.  This is just a different way of saying what Ogivly is saying. <BR> <BR>Both went into way more detail, but that's the jist of what they are saying. <BR> <BR>3. I've made some strides in making some different ads.  Most of them are a bit more creative, are &quot;risky&quot; if Ogivly or Bly were to look at them and have shorter copies.  However, everything I'm reading is suggesting that it's a mistake.  In fact, I should really go back and rework a lot of copy or delete some of the ads altogether (Like Vito for example, which seems to be very flat and doesn't do a very good job of selling or promising anything specific). <BR> <BR>I think I still have a week or two of working on these ads before I get it right.  I hope to launch them at the beginning of January, so I still have a lot of time. <BR> <BR>When I get some more time, I'll be sure to reply more specifically to your comments Brian.  There is some great stuff in there (like the period on the headline - my bad, utilizing the small caps (a typography article was saying the same thing for office documents, keeping the date on the same line, etc.)  I really appreciate it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ken first of all January isn't far away. You have to make the comps into mechanicals with bleed, trim and safety. If you aren't up on these contact someone who regularly does production for magazine ads. Also you will have to add a slug also something to bring up with a production person.  <BR> <BR>That Ogivly book is old! I suggest you read ad information thats been published fresh in the last couple of years. Trends change. <BR> <BR>Check out CreativePro.com they have a lot of useful articles and recently there was one about using different treatments on photos.  <BR> <BR>As ususal Ken keep up the good work</div>
