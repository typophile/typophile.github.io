body: From a 1919 topographical map of Mt. St. Helens. Closest font  <BR>I&#39;m getting
  is Craw Modern. Gotta be something closer. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37237.jpg"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>I immediately thought of the lovely <a href="http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/sirenne/pk_sirenne_text.htm">Sirenne</a>
  which was inspired <BR>by an old map, but this is of another era.

  body: Looks like it was hand-lettered. Maps back then usually were. It&#39;s very
    lovely, but I can&#39;t think of any fonts quite like it. You might be able to
    simulate it by stretching something like Century Expanded or DeVinne.

  body: I think it&#39;s time for someone to reinterpret this baby. Nothing <BR>really
    matches its width and italics. Go go go!

  body: Same thing I was thinking. I put your sample into my ideas folder. Someday
    soon, I hope. It looks like a fun one.

    modern with very wide serifs.

  body: I&#39;d LOVE to see a cleaned-up more-readable version of Dalliance without
    the strange characters like the K. I use that font and am constantly redrawing
    characters.

  body: I got a higher resolution image of this map and on closer inspection <BR>it
    is indeed hand lettered. Amazing work throughout. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been told
    that Tobias Frere-Jones did something very similar <BR>for Martha Stewart and
    it should be free from its proprietary <BR>contract very soon.
