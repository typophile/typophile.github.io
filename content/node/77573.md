body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m trying to put FontLab\u2019s super weak implementation
  of drawing things onto the glyph window canvas to some use. Y\u2019now, the one
  that disappears once you move a toolbar over it or switch to another window or app.\r\n\r\nMore
  specifically, I want to draw a path using a couple of LineTo-commands, but there
  seems to be no ClosePath implemented, or at least it\u2019s not documented anywhere.
  So how do I close such a path to get a solid shape?\r\n\r\nAnd once we\u2019re at
  it: Can one set drawing colors other than using the seven constants? They return
  integer values between 0 (black) and 16M (white), so could one set anything in between?\r\nEdit:
  I tried: yes one can.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nYanone\r\n\r\n<code>\r\ncanvas = fl.GetCanvas()\r\ncanvas.MoveTo(here)\r\ncanvas.LineTo(there)\r\ncanvas.LineTo(over
  there)\r\n# now what??\r\n</code>"

  body: "Hello Yanone,\r\n\r\nRegarding the colors:\r\n\r\nYou can use the FontLab
    build-in function RGB() to calculate the color values.\r\nIt is defined in Studio5/Macros/System/init.py
    and looks like this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\ndef RGB(r, g, b):\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return
    long(r) | (long(g) << 8) | (b << 16)\r\n</code>"

    but only found the reverse Integer to RGB conversion. Thank you.\r\nBut the b
    requires another long(), right?\r\n\r\n<cite>You can build a temporary glyph and
    use this glyph with the canvas.OutlineGlyph() or canvas.FillGlyph() method to
    draw on the canvas.</cite>\r\n\r\nI just tested that successfully with existing
    glyphs. I guess that constructing a glyph with my wanted path would work. But
    I couldn\u2019t get to apply a color as opposed to the previously used single
    lines. Neither pen_color nor brush_color changed the fill color away from black.
    If it\u2019s not possible to change the color, I might want to stick with the
    lines."

  body: "hi Yanone,\r\nif i would start messing with canvas i would look into these
    2 Tool scripts. \r\nProbably you know both.\r\nErik's \"measure glyph\" has supernice
    colors and neat curves.\r\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/robofab/browse_thread/thread/9f1e292498d5c929/c85f485b0f463f6e?lnk=gst&q=measureglyph#c85f485b0f463f6e\r\n\r\nGustavo's
    Pixelbrush draws filled shapes.\r\nhttps://github.com/gferreira/PixelBrush\r\n\r\nTheres
    one modification of that one by F.Berlaen, with stiches instead of boxes. Unfortunately
    on FL canvas it draws still rectangles (once i tried to make triangles, as well
    didnt work out to change the preview).\r\nPlease update us. Post your tipps if
    you have any success with canvas.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nAnton"

  body: "Hi, oh i found it!\r\n\r\nI wrote this script to draw simple straight segment
    on FL canvas. For segments, curves and such... need to add few more lines. Basically
    FL canvas has no line thickness and no propper fill. So my solution: lets plot
    the image with geometric shapes that Fontlab supports. Rect and Ellipse. It runs
    instantly, thus: why not?\r\n\r\nhttp://anton.korkork.com/tech_work/scripts/Draw_Thick_line.py\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\n\r\nAnton\r\n*Comments to improve are welcome. For example if i
    click on cavas my image disapears, in some other scripts it doesnt disappear so
    fast. I think it has to do with the code structure.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Anton,\r\n\r\nthanks for hinting to the two tools, both of which I didn't
    know yet, and yours.\r\nBut neither helps. Yours and Gustavo's draw rectangles,
    Erik's draws curves. I need a way to draw an arbitrary path, a polygon (I don't
    have curves for now).\r\nSo the way I see it the only way to draw that is to iterate
    through the whole canvas using a Point In Polygon function or RoboFab's PointInside
    and draw one-pixel big Rectangles.\r\nBut I tried. It drew one shape in several
    minutes, so that's kind of beyond reason.\r\nLooks like I might have to stick
    with the unfilled lines.\r\n"

  body: Using a function to calculate the bounding box of a polygon prior to iterting
    through the canvas, I was able to speed up the process to an extent where I can
    now sit in front of the screen and watch the pixels draw (e.g. Blinkenlights).
    It now takes only 427 seconds (more than 7 minutes) to draw my outlines. The result
    is a piece of computer art that seems to come straight out of a time machine.
    Almost performance art!

    may work.\r\n\r\nYou can draw with a 'ReportLabPen' from FontTools (works also
    with robofab) to create a reportlab.graphics.shapes.Group. Then render this vector
    graphic with reportlab.graphics.renderPM.drawToPIL() to an image. Finaly paste
    this image with the FontLab Canvas.PutImage() method into your canvas.\r\n\r\nEigi"
