  Mag's logo. Can anyone identify it? See images below. While you're at it check out

  body: "Looks similar to \r\n<a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-nobel/\">Nobel
    Bold</a> designed by Tobias Frere-Jones, Sjoerd Hendrik de Roos and published
    by Font Bureau.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NobelBoldByFontBureau_3722.jpg]\r\nThe
    magazine logo seems to be slightly heavier and wider.\r\nMyFonts Blurb: \r\n\"Nobel
    offers personal variations on strict Bauhaus geometry.\r\nIn 1929, three years
    after the Futura release, Sjoerd Henrik de Roos at Amsterdam explored alternative
    character sets to enliven basic Futura forms.\r\nThe Nobel series was designed
    for Font Bureau by Tobias Frere-Jones, who fondly views Nobel as \u2018Futura
    cooked in dirty pots & pans\u2019\"\r\nDon \r\n"

    pretty convinced it is as simple as \"Futura Bold with /C customized from 2 mirrored
    /G's top half parts\"."

  body: Ryuk. I think you're right. I just mocked it up. I suppose it wouldn't hurt
    to just ask Graphics Mag how they made their logo. Cheers!
