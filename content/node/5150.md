    matter what logo you slap on the granite sign in front of the gated community.
    This market is buying square footage and that&#39;s about it. ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>As
    for your marks, 1 is nice, but rather cliche...I think I&#39;ve seen more slightly
    distressed/handwritten logos for whispering pines/shady acres/prarie rock/etc.
    in front of fields of houses than not. <BR> <BR>I like 2 alot, though I get a
    &#39;cigarette logo&#39; vibe from it. <BR> <BR>I think #3 is the one I&#39;d
    go with. It&#39;s got a bit of a modern feel to it, yet it fits in with the typical
    McMansion development logo style &#40;as to not scare away the jones&#39;s&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>The bottom 3 are nice, but just not doing it for me.'

    chosen, and I also like the second on the left &#40;condensed&#41; and the bottom
    two fonts. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing them with the graphics you are intending.
    One side note: I really like the weather vane idea but if these are high-end homes
    you may want to re-think using a tractor.'

  body: 'I agree with Kirsten, however If you are going to engrave this typeface you
    would would most likely want a clean version of it. Or If you like the distressed
    look, distress it yourself. It just seems funny when the R&#39;s are distressed
    in the exact same way. IMPO distressed types should only be distressed when the
    paper or other printing medium unintentionally distresses them. There is nothing
    wrong with a beautiful, confident, classical, and perfectly set serif typeface.&#40;Maybe
    a BEMBO&#41; <BR> <BR>Also certain faces would look better in wood and certain
    faces would look better in stone. <BR> <BR>An important question would be: <BR>
    <BR>Have they developed a style guideline for the development or are homeowners
    going to be able to build whatever they like &#40;modern or classic&#41;? <BR>  <BR>

  body: Hi Scott <BR> <BR>I vote for number two. It has a little vibe of hipness to
    it which the customers might draw some comfort from as they buy into the dowdy
    McMansion lifestyle. With a nice &#34;farm&#34; illustrative element I think you
    could chase away the cigarette associations. <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re looking for

    Farms to get fresh goat cheese, corn, and apples.&#34; Only the ones on the third

  body: 'Hi Scott, <BR> <BR>Oh man, can I relate to this! Its a tall order creating
    something appealing based on a mirage that has nothing to do with anything. I&#39;ve
    done more than my fair share of these new housing development brochures. Two months
    ago I did one called Vintage Ranch. Predictably, it wound up having a nostalgic
    barn thing happening. The logo was modeled after antiquated fruit packing lables.
    All in all it worked out fine, but everyone knows they are being sold a bill of
    goods when they are selecting Floorplan 4 with the &#34;spanish&#34; detailing
    package.  <BR> <BR>All that aside, I agree that what you&#39;ve got going in #2
    has the most potential. It works well with the weather vane too &#40;solid version&#41;.
    If you do decide to go with this, note the distortion/color issue from stretching
    the W &#40;R looks ok&#41;. <BR> <BR>Do the flooplans have names?  <BR>If so would
    you share them with us, just for laughs. :-&#41; <BR>They might also give you
    imagery ideas. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>Randy'

  body: Hi Scott, gotta hand it to you...you did find some beautiful imagery of tractors.
    But I agree with Steve in that it says farm products rather than luxury homes.
    And I&#39;m not sure the bucolic charm from the photos would translate into the
    stone or wood applications. The weather vane is working. Have you considered having
    the name as part of the weather vane itself? &#40;W for West W for Winsor&#41;Especially
    on the next to last design where the letters are right reading. It might be tricky
    at the crossover point, but it could be worth the exploration. Also what kind
    of architectural style will the buildings be following? Is there any inspiration
    that could be pulled from that?

  body: Well wouldn&#39;t ya know it. I included the staple cliche background watermark
    image with the widely kerned type and my client was all over it. Meanwhile, all
    you typophiles unanimously &#40;except for Hrant&#41; pointed me toward the stacked
    &#34;marlboro&#34; concept. <BR> <BR>Below are the two concepts that my client
    currently has on the table. I have offered to pursue a third direction &#40;as
    a strategic maneuver to pull his attention away from his current favorite&#41;
    which is Kirsten&#39;s recommended concept, but right now I am waiting for a response.

  body: I like them both, and I like the colors.  <BR> <BR>What I think helps tie
    the image and the type together on the first design is that the letters in the
    weather vane and the Windsor name are the same font. Did you try using the condensed
    slab characters for the NSEW letters on the second design? <BR> <BR>What I believe
    adds to the &#34;Marlboro&#34; look of the second design is the large W and R.
    What if the letters were one size? but then FARMS might need to be re-thought
    since it would no longer tuck in. Hmm, perhaps if FARMS were set as wide as WINSOR
    it might make the type block appear to be the coupola the weather vane is attached
    to. Then agin it might look too heavy.

  body: 'Scott, I think the bottom of the two makes more of a statement. The type
    is more architectural and strong. The only thing I wonder is if you could alter
    the cap W to be a little more open, the bottom legs are kinda heavy, they don&#39;t
    balance out with the cap R which feels lighter. Not 100% positive, but it seems
    that most housing developments I&#39;ve noticed seem to be trying to be posh or
    elegant ... we&#39;re just too close to mountains. Exclusive can&#39;t be stated
    in more ways than just white space and thin serifs.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: The top version could work but considering the potential to engrave the logo
    you will run into difficulties with the R touching the weather vane post. I also
    think the bottom version could work but only as a typographic solution sans the
    weathervane. Consider wood type style ornaments for the bottom version if you
    feel the need to stylize it a bit more. <BR> <BR>

    I have a small but vocal rally for Alexis Way, Blake Court and Crystal Boulevard...
    just too dang funny! I think I will post where I am so far with that. Its really
    funny because the agent who sells them likes one logo, the owner likes another
    and the owner&#39;s wife likes the third one! Where do I keep finding these people?!?!
    <BR> <BR>all kidding aside, scott - I think its a very nice identity and I especially
    think you have presented it well in your standards manual I hope you can post
    a photo of the entryway when its all done to see how it works as 3-d elements.
    I am currently also working with a shopping mall and we are having &#34;negotiations&#34;
    about how the logo will be on signage.

    cigarette packaging is interesting, as I am about as anti-cigarette as one gets.
    I did associate the Marlboro logo with this, but that didn&#39;t bother me too
    much because the words were distinctively different. After giving it more thought,
    however, I remembered the Winston logo, which is too close for comfort. Unfortunately,
    the logo is already in application. <BR> <BR>Hopefully, the fact that Utah is
    one of the most smoke free states in the US &#40;location of development&#41;
