  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Does anyone know anything at all about various U.S. license plates and the faces used on them &#40;does anyone care as much as I do&#41;?  I&#39;ve noticed three basic categories for plates, which I classify thusly:   <BR> <BR>1&#41;Non-designed...  these appear to have been fashioned strictly with the limitations of production-machinery in mind, it would seem that almost no thought went into psychological issues &#40;legibility, etc.&#41;--I&#39;ll let this class be represented by the state of Ohio &#40;but it seems Class 1 is actually the style used by most states&#41;. <BR> <BR>2&#41;Semi-designed...  at least SOME thought beyond mechanical constraints went into the design of these plates &#40;the attempt to make the forms more human has resulted in these plates being significantly more legible than Class 1 at great distances&#41;--represented by West Virginia&#42;. <BR> <BR>3&#41;Fully-designed...  I&#39;ve seen only one state so far that fits this category--Virginia.  These plates are amazing, their face is both seriffed AND modulated &#40;and legibility at great distance is excellent&#41;. <BR> <BR>Which brings me to my point...  I contacted the Ohio BMV about the plates&#39; type designer, and the response was that the 3M Corporation did the work.  I don&#39;t believe, however, that my question was fully understood.  I think 3M may have devised the production &#40;printing&#41; method, but not the actual typeface design. <BR> <BR>And my question to all of you...  I also contacted the Virginia BMV about their plates, but an official quickly wrote back that he didn&#39;t know who designed the face--do any of you know who designed Virginia&#39;s license plate typeface?  I&#39;m dying to know. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;In an especially ironic twist, Ohioans and West Virginians are perpetually feuding over who&#39;s the classiest and most metropolitan of the two, Ohio usually wins, I think &#40;is it because I live in Ohio?&#41;, because we have cities like Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati.  West Virginia&#39;s license plates are designed better than Ohio&#39;s, they just look better too--and this is funny because Ohio would never want to be second to West Virginia in anything &#40;I don&#39;t feel this way--not an Ohio native&#41;.</div>

I think this whole structure was carefully planned, the state of Virginia seems to know what they&#39;re doing. <BR> <BR>On your advice, I&#39;ll persist for an answer.</div>

You&#39;d think that seriffed forms would not be the best choice for an object that requires easy recognition and travels at high speeds &#40;or moves at all&#41;, but just a few days ago I had the rare opportunity to observe three cars on the highway just outside of Cleveland--one from Ohio, one from West Virginia, and yes, one from Virginia.  I realized that some cosmic force was allowing me the chance to test legibility among the three classes I just listed above; so I slowed my speed and watched...   <BR> <BR>-At about 25 feet legibility was comparable in all three classes. <BR>-At around 35 feet Ohio was seriously losing ground. <BR>-At about 45 feet Ohio was entirely out, West Virginia was OK, and Virginia was clear as a bell. <BR>-Past 80 feet Virginia was at least discernible, while Ohio and West Virginia were difficult to distinguish their state of origin. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure that too much research has been done in this field, doesn&#39;t seem that way.</div>
