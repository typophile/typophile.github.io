body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/P9220037_6500.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere's a new
  card designed by me, for me!\r\nWe've changed the trade-name of out website to \"slowprint.com\"
  so it's time to roll out a card to replace the \"Exquisite Letterpress\" design
  which has been in use for the past couple of years.\r\n\r\nThis design is printed
  in four colors, with extremely tight register.\r\nI figured I should make a point
  of printing a tough job for my own cards, since I'm telling all you designers that
  we can handle whatever you through our way ;-)\r\n\r\nAlthough it started as a representation
  of the CMYK registration mark, I now think of the colors as being more in line with
  the traditional seasonal directions like the Native American 'mandala' or 'medicine
  wheel' I've included both positive and negative glyphs in the design, allowing the
  dimension of the impression full play. The very fine white lines are about .5 point.\r\n\r\nThe
  type is Carol Twombly's Nueva from Adobe Systems.\r\n\r\nWe'd be happy to send a
  couple of cards (limited availability, however) and maybe some other goodies to
  anyone who would care to drop us a note through the website (do include your mailing
  address, and note that you read about it on typophile.com!)\r\n\r\nhttp://slowprint.com/contact-us"

    pretty amazing for the price, although the lens has obvious limitations, and the
    UI on the camera is really pretty terrible...\r\n\r\nGreat for just this sort
    of thing, though ;-)\r\nCheers\r\n\r\npeter\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://slowprint.com/ Letterpress
