body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am involved in a project in which I have the need for an oblique
  UC display font. I am looking for a display font that is fairly dark and is a true
  slanted roman (no decoration on the J or Y which I seem to see in many UC Italic
  fonts.)\r\n\r\nI am also looking for a font with a particular style of \"A\"--I
  am not sure if these have a name, but an \"A\" wherein the right-hand stroke is
  angled like the stem of a B, F, L etc.\r\n\r\nThe closest I have come so far would
  be Font Bureau's Farnham Display. Attached is its italic UC. My only complaints
  with it are its J and Y and that I am looking for something that has smoother serif
  bracketing, but not a didone.\r\n\r\nI feel like this should be fairly easy to find
  but for some reason can't dig anything up. Any advice is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nPaul"

    for some Fleischman revivals, thats what Farnham is, I believe.\r\nAlso, Farnham
    Text Italic has normal looking J's and Y's, although the A is less dramatic."
