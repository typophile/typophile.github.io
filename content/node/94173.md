body: "Hi everybody ,\r\n\r\nI am working on a logo for a high class italian clothing
  brand.\r\n\r\nThe logo should be stylish and with a somewhat prestigious feeling
  to compete in the fashion world with brands such as Armani, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari,
  D&G etc. It must look like a well established brand.\r\n\r\nI ended up with the
  following solution, which seems to fulfill the requirements previously described.
  \r\n\r\nI would love to hear your opinion on how to improve it/adjust it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ramiero_3644.jpg]"

  body: Didone feels like an overly obvious solution. To me it is a very tried and
    true way to suggest high fashion. This might not be the wrong solution, but without
    exploring dozens of other ideas, I wouldn't stop the research and ideation phase
    of the project. I would be concerned that this gets lost without a bit more unique
    personality.

  body: "Luma is right. But still I kinda like it.\r\n\r\nMaybe redraw it by hand
    with a slightly larger x height? Just a quick idea.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could explore
    some patterns or other graphical elements to make the brand unique."

  body: "I also think this one's too generic for a budding brand. Maybe you can play
    \ a little with the typography and make the background color lighter. Gray would
    be great. \r\n"
