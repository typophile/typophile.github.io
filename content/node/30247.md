  body: "With only one duplicated letter ('o') I find it hard to conclude that this
    is not a font, although it certainly may not be. I looked in Parts 12 (Childish
    printing) and 14 (Strange/Distressed scripts) of the Script Font ID Guide and
    came up with no matches, but a few fairly close alternatives, if you are open
    to that idea:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=420862\">Vreehend</a>
    from GarageFonts;\r\n\r\nLinotype <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/russisch-brot/\">Russisch
    Brot</a>;\r\n\r\nand Ethan Dunham's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fonthead/good-dog/\">Good
    Dog</a>\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
