<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I know this problem has been discussed before. Google advanced search is not my friend today. I have an InDesign CS2 file. I am using Tyfa from Storm in Postscript Type 1. (client does not have license to Opentype version.) The small caps are going to jibberish when I output to a PDF. Any ideas? Do you know where the other thread is?
Thanks!

<div class=commentbody>I had this too once, the small caps - which was part of the font, not a "small caps" setting - came out bitmapped. But this was from Quark 6, not Indesign.</div>

<div class=commentbody>You were using Tyfa?
Yeah. It is a separate font file. So frustrating. Probably wouldn't happen if I could use the OT version. Grrrr.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Forgive my shot in the dark-
Have you tried printing the file to postscript and running the .ps file through Distiller?
Besides that, I got nothing. PDFs and font embedding confuses the hell out of me. I have heard of some issue with Central European Type 1 fonts and PDFs generated from InDesign CS.
Good luck!</div>

<div class=commentbody>No I was using Today Sans. But it was so frustrating - it printed fine but in the pdf it looked like hell. I ended up saving the files as .eps and opening them (page by page - luckily there were only 6 pages) in Illustrator, re-saving as a pdf. Pain in my butt.
I'm having lots of tech problems right now, Mercury must be back in retrograde.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I had forgotten this happened before. Frantisek was kind enough to assist me with OT versions. However, as I've mentioned I have to us PS Type 1 for this project.
What is apparently happening is some bad encoding. Oh poodles!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Have any of you ever had a problem with the letterforms being okay (not bitmapped as patty described above) but the order of the keystrokes changed?
In 2001 I did a 256-page large-format book, heavy to text. Thomson Shore was the printer and wanted it as PDF rather than native Quark files. Fine by me. I printed to Postscript and ran Distiller, and sent the job off. Didn't bother to proofread the PDF because I had just had a complete read done on the latest set of corrected page proofs (those proofs printed from Quark).
When I got the printed books back, to my complete horror, on one page the text changed from -- they'd hoped -- to -- they ‘d hoped. [Not sure how easy it is for you to see this on-screen, but instead of the first word having y-apostrophe-d, it was y-space-singleopenquote-d.]
I went back to check my native Quark file and it was fine.
This experience made me permanently distrustful of sending files off in PDF form without YET another round of proofing. Made me look careless as the typesetter, when in fact I had been scrupulously careful to have a complete professional read done before converting to PDF (in addition to prior proofreading work earlier in the project).
Has anyone else had this experience?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yuck. Bruce that sounds horrible. I wonder if it isn't somehow related. Ergo, font encoding gone awry.

<div class=commentbody>No but I had my H&Js go missing once, creating some truly horrible line breaks and rivers. But that was an earlier earlier version, probably before even Acrobat 4.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sometimes my ä and ö letters vanish, even with distiller. Like yesterday with Cocon. This happens especially with Freehand (yes, I know... but some clients still insist on using it). Some days the only way around it is to convert text to outlines. Good job there are usually only a few pages!</div>
