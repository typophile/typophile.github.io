  project.\r\nIt's a renaissance inspired italic serif based on old calligraphy principally
  by Arrighi.\r\n\r\nIt's no vectorized yet, so there is some irregularity along the
  letters.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

  body: "Wow, very nice work. I like how the letters consist of many straight lines
    rather than curves. You don't see that very often, but particularly as a book
    face it will look amazing.\r\n\r\nI think the 'z' looks too heavy near the stem.
    Also I'm wondering why the tittle on the 'j' is bigger than the tittle on the
    'i'. I've never seen it before. Does it have something to do with the Renaissance
    style lettering?"

    bit.\r\nThe o is a little bit big,\r\nthe tittle on the j is the good one. Will
    correct the one on the i on future versions."
