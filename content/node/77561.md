  workshops and serves as entertainment on company parties and such.\r\n\r\nFor creation
  of the logo I wanted to stay away from the clich\xE9 cocktail logo's. Instead I
  tried to find an appropriate typographical solution. (look attachment) \r\n\r\nThis
  is the look and feel that I was aiming for:\r\n\r\n- 60ties cocktail vibe\r\n- classy
  but not too chic\r\n- red, black and white\r\n(think NBC's show Mad Men)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_cocktails4u_zwart_4340.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow
  with the logo more or less done I am looking for a sans serif corporate typeface.\r\n\r\nGill
  Sans Light (Condensed)\r\nFrutiger Light (Condensed)\r\n.....\r\n...\r\n\r\nMore/better
  suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\nFeedback on the logo is also very welcome. ;-)"

  body: "I have some critique on the logo if you're still open to it:\r\n\r\nYour
    x-height seems a bit on the low side.  I realize that it's part of the look you're
    going for but I'd consider moving your cap-height down a bit so that the ascenders
    don't break up the flow of the word so much. It would also help with that very
    large space you have in your C (which feels a bit awkward to me) and the somewhat
    narrow appearance of your 4. Other than that, the t doesn't typically extend (or
    at least doesn't have to) to the cap-height, so you might consider bringing that
    down a bit, which should help with the flow.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for the Corporate face,
    are you looking for something that's going to forward that 60's cocktail vibe,
    or something a bit more neutral?\r\n\r\n\r\nMad Men is on AMC  by the way"

  body: "Hello there!\r\n\r\nI have the same feeling as Kazyole concerning the \"C\".
    It somehow appears to be to slim compared to the rest. At the same time the 4
    could have a bigger \"body\" by lowering the horizontal line even further to get
    this kind of vintage look.\r\n\r\nMaybe Neutraface would also be a possible choice
    for the corporate font, not just because the name's more \xABneutral\xBB. ;)"

    the \"U\" abbreviation with the 60s, nor does it strike me as being classy.  I
    associate it instead with casual text messaging.\r\n\r\nI know you didn't pick
    the name; I'm just saying that the style goals may not be a good match for the
    name."

    especially with this, but also everything else that's been said. [ What was said
    about the \"U\" goes for the \"4\" as well. ]\r\n"
