    cant find the website i was reading <BR>&#62; this in <BR> <BR>You&#39;re thinking
    of the lower-case &#34;eth&#34; or &#34;edh&#34; <BR>&#40;pronounced like &#34;eth&#34;
    in &#34;whether&#34;&#41;, which is <BR>used in Anglo-Saxon, Faroese and Icelandic.
    <BR> <BR>The &#34;d&#34; in Andrij&#39;s logo does look rather like an <BR>&#34;eth&#34;,
    especially with the swooping crossbar <BR>cutting through it. I&#39;m not sure
    that this is really <BR>a problem, though, depending on where and <BR>how Andreij
    intends to use the logo.'

  body: andrij, <BR> <BR>that logo looks nice and diligently designed. i think the
    incontinuous loop on the &#34;d&#34; ascender fits right in and the &#34;a&#34;
    is okay for me, too. <BR> <BR>but if - if! - your personal logo is mainly thought
    to tell people what your name is, it might be too hard to read. personally - if
    i didn&#39;t know your name - at first sight, i&#39;d read &#34;andaj&#34;, on
    second i wouldn&#39;t know at all how to decipher those letters. <BR> <BR>like
    alex i think the top end of the &#34;r&#34; could be a bit thicker, but i think
    it might need more than that. maybe redesign the &#34;r&#34; in a way that both
    the &#34;r&#34; itself and the &#34;i&#34; become easier to recognize and easier
    to distinguish from the &#34;a&#34;. the following is a quick&#39;n&#39;dirty
    bitmap work to illustrate what i mean and is <b>not</b> meant as a final design
    &#40;see one post below, please&#41;. <BR> <BR>peter

    ... now that i look at it, i doubt whether that makes the name more legible. one
    could say the &#34;ri&#34; looks even more like an &#34;a&#34; now ... well, it
    was just an idea. may better ones follow. <BR> <BR>peter

  body: i&#39;ve played around another while and after discarding four or five versions,
    i think this one might show the way to an actual improvement - at least i think
    legibility has profited &#40;while it&#39;s still anything but perfect&#41;. i
    find that the &#34;j&#34; gets along quite well without the dot, which the &#34;i&#34;
    needs more urgently. besides that, i made only minor changes &#40;if at all -
    i&#39;ve lost the overview&#41;. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13169.gif"

    stem &#40;that doesn&#39;t have to be as prominent as in my below draft&#41; would

  body: yeah david, you are right, thanks for reminding me... i dont think there will
    be a legibility problem either <BR>p.j. efforts are really nice, however i am
    not sure about that &#34;r&#34; in the last version... all the characters of this
    logo escape formality, and that 2 -stroked &#34;r&#34;... xm, i dont know what&#39;s
    best
