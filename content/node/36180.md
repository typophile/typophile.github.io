  body: Can you please isolate the sans and post it at a bigger size? This isn't going

  body: The swash treatment may be inspired by Bookman, but that's not the base typeface.
    The shapes are much closer to something like ITC Garamond.

  body: I agree with Marc, it doesn't really match Bookman. It's (obviously) a rip-off
    of Rolling Stone.
