  in design and that means picking up the pieces of my long lost relationship with
  Type. We had it good back in the day but we both grew successful, didn't have time
  for one another and then eventually drifted apart. But I've decided no more games.
  I'm back. And this time, it is for real.\r\n\r\nI love you Type. You are all that
  is pretty and perfect. \r\n\r\nForever,\r\nzeena\r\n\r\nPS - To further prove my
  pining for you, I've attached a token of my affection."

  body: "I sent this through my pc rather than my mac (my mac is down, don't hurt
    me!) Therefore no .gif available at this time since i can only create the .gif
    from a .ppt file and as you might know, this looks atrocious and does not do the
    typeface justice. believe me, this is tragic for the both of us! you can also
    view the font here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.showstudio.com/archive/title/p\r\n\r\ncredit
    to nick night.\r\n\r\nthe typeface is listed under pagan poetry, which is what
    nick created (inspired by the video he made for bjork for the song with the same
    name)"
