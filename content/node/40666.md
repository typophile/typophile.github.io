  Wide Bold Italic</strong>, which I like for its overall round feel and softness.
  Having said that, I'd like to stay away from anything that has too much of a tech-y
  feel to it (ie. Neo Sans, Apex New etc).\r\nSome quirks in the design are nice but
  not a must.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSeb "
