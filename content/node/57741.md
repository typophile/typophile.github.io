  saved from Photoshop) into Word, the correct dimensions (vertical rectangle) appears,
  however it has a fill of solid black. The image should have instead the company
  name, logo, etc. \r\n\r\nHow to proceed? Your advice is greatly appreciated.\r\nMerci!!"

  body: "Google found several things. First, there's a bug in Word's handling of JPGs
    from Photoshop. Supposedly, there was a fix for both Word 2004 and 2008; do you
    have all the updates? Other found suggestions: (1) use a TIF instead of a JPG;
    (2) open the JPG in a third program (e.g., Preview) and resave it; (3) convert
    from CYMK to RGB.\r\n\r\nIf you use Word's insert picture from file, does your
    JPG show up as a thumbnail in the dialog box?\r\n\r\nhttp://forums.macosxhints.com/archive/index.php/t-36344.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.mac.office.word&tid=033a76a1-9c21-45a7-9017-25b0322b0517&cat=en_US_3cf8ecf1-ca81-4391-b07d-8933029ee8a9&lang=en&cr=US&sloc=&p=1\r\n\r\n"
