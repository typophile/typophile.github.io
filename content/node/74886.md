body: "Hi all,\r\nI'm working on a new web page for an academic association whose
  name is 39 letters long (divided into seven words). While they internally tend to
  shorten the name, using a four-letter acronym, I would like to instead -- for clarity
  -- use the full name of the association at the top of the web page. Design-wise,
  I struggle working with such a long name, though. Does anybody have examples of
  companies/associations/etc with long names, where the logotype has been solved with
  elegance? All types of examples are of interest, print or digital ...\r\n\r\nIn
  advance: Thanks for any suggestions!\r\n\r\n"

    recently <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/pwc.php">caved
    in to the acronym</a>. I liked the old quirky thing.

  body: "Will this logotype be used in only one place -- across the top of a web page
    -- or might it eventually be used other places where the available space might
    be more limited (like a small web ad, or a business card, or a postage-stamp-size
    link graphic)?\r\n\r\nA very long, one-line logotype can be a real problem in
    situations like that, as you may need to reduce the type to a tiny size.\r\n\r\nSo
    my advice is to stack it on two or more lines, unless you're absolutely sure you'll
    never need to reduce it to a small size.\r\n\r\nYou also might try using the acronym
    as the logo, and then spell out the full name in smaller type below or beside
    it. Then if you're faced with situations with very limited space, you could just
    use the acronym alone.\r\n"
