body: "(With apologies for cross-posting)\r\n\r\nWe are looking for exceptional candidates
  for full-time postgraduate study in the Department of Typography at Reading. The
  University will award one AHRC-funded studentship for our practice-based MA programmes:
  Book Design, Information Design or Typeface Design, with entry in October 2011.\L\r\n\r\nWe
  will also be putting candidates forward for doctoral and MA studentships funded
  by the University of Reading.\L\L\r\n\r\nThese schemes offer different levels of
  support depending on your country of origin and residence (AHRC is only open to
  UK/EU applicants, but UoR to all nationals. They are very competitive. Read the
  details, and if you have questions email Carolyn Davidson at c.davidson@reading.ac.uk
  . The links below are thin on details; if you are interested, email Carolyn at first
  instance, with a description of your background and area of work. If you are a current
  student you will need to be predicted a high grade at graduation. Be prepared to
  work very quickly to put in a good application, and think about possible referees.\r\n\r\nSend
  your completed applications (including two references) to Elaine Harris by Friday
  18th February 2011 at Joint Faculty Admissions Office, University of Reading, HUMSS
  126D, Reading RG6 6AA (e.harris@reading.ac.uk). Ms. Harris will also be the first
  point of contact for any enquiries relating to the competition. See http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography/pg-taught/typ-pgtcourses.aspx

  body: "Craig, sorry: something missing there (fixed). The AHRC pay fees and living
    expenses to UK residents, or fees only to EU residents. The University's own studentships
    are open to all nationalities. The rationale is clear: the funding council uses
    tax revenue, so the benefits should go to taxpayers. The University has more independence,
    so it can afford to seek out the very best worldwide. (Jo de Baerdemaeker, from
    Belgium, and Myra Thiessen, from Canada, were recent award holders. Titus Nemeth,
    an Austrian, is a current one.)\r\n\r\nThe AHRC professional preparation studentships
    are primarily intended for recent graduates or professionals relatively early
    in their career who can make a convincing argument for support in their developing
    specialised skills. The UoR studentships are different, in that they have a clear
    research focus; no terminal practical element in these proposals. \r\n\r\nNick,
    I am not sure what in your own experience is relevant to an announcement of funding
    opportunities for MA students. The AHRC studentship I refer to has nothing to
    do with the system of research grants or fellowships, which I suspect you would
    have applied for. But you seem to have little respect for a process you deride?
    Why apply if you don't trust the system? (No need to answer.)  \r\n\r\nIn any
    case, this is money that can make the difference between \"I can\" and \"I can't\"
    for someone to realise a life-changing goal. Any such opportunity should be welcomed.
    \r\n"

    The worldwide ones are in an open competition with other departments, so the level
    is exceptionally high; but, as I mentioned, we''ve got an excellent track record
    of getting them. '
