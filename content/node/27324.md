    could always try <a/href=\"http://www.typography.com/catalog/leviathan/index.html\">Leviathan</a>

  body: "Royal Gothic is also pretty similar to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/folio-sb/extra-bold/\">Folio
    Extra Bold</a>.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Line typeface is an odd one. That G is very atypical,
    for starters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
