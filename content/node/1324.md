body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to educate myself as much as possible with regards
  to design. I&#39;ve read as much as I can get my hands on with regards to typography
  but I don&#39;t really feel there&#39;s any replacement for experience, which I
  don&#39;t have. For the first time I&#39;ve got full control over the design of
  something the company I work for is doing and I want to make a really good job of
  it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m trying to create a visual hierarchy for my type that isn&#39;t
  boring. The two major concerns I have are that a&#41; It looks quite stylised &#40;which
  doesn&#39;t bode well for the &#34;good typography is invisible to the untrained
  eye&#34; rule I keep hearing about&#41; and b&#41; Even though the counter spaces
  on the fonts I&#39;ve picked seem to go well together, I&#39;m not sure about the
  variations between other elements of the letters. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not hoping to
  do anything profound or technically impressive. I&#39;d just rather not make any
  glarring errors with my first real foray into laying out type. I&#39;m aware that
  the colours for the roll overs are weak and damage the readability, I just haven&#39;t
  come up with any alternatives yet. Obviously it&#39;ll look a lot different with
  lots of text, but I want to get the foundations correct before I start worrying
  about the rest of it. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1644.gif"

  opinions/suggestions/criticisms etc. <BR> <BR>cheers.

  body: ' Hi Benjie, I would like to be of some help but it is not easy as you have
    not told us what type of company it is you work for. What is the audience / demographics
    that will be seeing the work? What type of information are you trying to deliver
    with what type of impact. What is the current identity/brand and market positioning
    of the company you work for. These types of questions are much more important
    than what typeface to use, If you have a clear picture of the answers I asked
    I would say you may be ready for the creative process to begin and exploration
    is a good way to do this. Do not be too critical on your self at this stage. The
    rules you mentioned are good guidelines but not absolutes. Just look at Emigre
    type foundry, they did everything wrong according to the critics but they are
    now considered pioneers in modern type design. <BR>As strange as it may sound
    I often qualify typeface selection for projects based on circulation, if a typeface
    is distributed by a major foundry or has been over used I will not use it. I personally
    aim for exclusivity in choosing typefaces. As for your choices of Omega and Rotondo,
    they may work well together but in what context? '

  body: ' Hi, <BR> <BR>Sorry- I could&#39;ve been more helpful there couldn&#39;t
    I? <BR> <BR>Anyway, the target demographic is difficult to state. I sorta have
    two. I&#39;m building a specialist directory of hotels and guesthouses. The target
    in terms of getting people to sign up seems to be largely women in there mid 40&#39;s
    with relatively traditional tastes. This is contrasted by larger hotels, which
    whilst being fewer in number are considerably more profitable for us. On the other
    hand the target audience is young mobile businessmen and tourists of all ages.
    <BR> <BR>I started out trying to get a very 1950&#39;s &#39;I dream of Genie&#39;,
    or picture postcard sort of look. Then with the mixture of targets I decided I&#39;d
    prefer something that a&#41;didn&#39;t clash with the individual businesses method
    of marketing themselves, and b&#41;was appropriate for all. <BR> <BR>What I now
    want is a type design that blends into the background and doesn&#39;t interfere
    with anything. Something really clean and subtle. To that end I considered using
    arial. I know that that&#39;s a bit of a cop-out, but my feeling was that because
    it&#39;s everywhere on the web, it would present no presence as people of all
    tastes using the internet are accustomed to it by now. <BR> <BR>Currently there
    is no branding or status for the project online or offline, so I&#39;ve got a
    clean palette from that point of view. <BR> <BR>Rotondo has been dropped because
    my boss hates it &#40;and he&#39;s paying my salary&#41;, which I think&#39;s
    a shame, but never mind. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions, on how to fade type selection/design
    towards subtlety much appreciated. <BR> <BR>cheers. '
