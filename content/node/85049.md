  href=\"http://qandacreative.com\">(Q&A Creative)</a>. I'm currently using Megalopolis
  for the headings and Candara Bold for the content (regular just doesn't seem to
  feel right). The goal was to try and find fonts that would go well with the hand
  drawn type of the logo (larger version attached if needed).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have
  any suggestions for different fonts or adjustments to the way I'm currently using
  the ones I have?\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated."

    other outside the basic character set) in the body copy in Win XP."

  body: Like I said, I'm thinking of changing the typeface, especially since I'm relying
    on one that I'm not sure is even available on XP, falling back to Verdana instead.
