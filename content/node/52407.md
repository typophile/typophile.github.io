    that needed to be improved on? Just curious if you have anything special in mind.\r\nF"

    is done with a later version and you do see why it was done. Perhaps ignorance
    is bliss! I do know that when I saw Berling Nova (a face I like very much)I saw
    quite clearly the improvements over Berling as was."

  body: "Of course, the most obvious changes are: \r\n<ul><li>the extended character
    set. <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/en/43839/aldusstdroman-charactermap.html\">Aldus
    Roman OT</a> contains 408 glyphs, while <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/en/109960/aldusnovacombook-charactermap.html\">Aldus
    nova Com Book</a> has 677. Most of them are due to the added support of Central
    European languages. But Linotype also has added a number of ligatures, ordinals,
    superscript letters and a wider set of figures.</li>\r\n<li>the added Bold and
    Bold Italic</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIt seems every single character has been revised
    and altered \u2013 sometimes sightly, sometimes strikingly (Q, s, t, \u2026).\r\nThe
    ascender length has been reduced drastically.\r\nLooking at the italic f, w or
    y, I have to say that I liked the classic (digital) Aldus better. The new version
    looks less characteristic. Or less quirky? Maybe it is just a matter of getting
    used to the new. Maybe Aldus nova has a better colour. And it certainly does integrate
    better with the other Palatino nova family members.\r\n\r\nI think it is impossible
    to draw any conclusions without having a couple of printed pages, in both versions
    with otherwise equal settings.\r\n\r\nBtw, [[John D. Berry]] wrote an <a href=\"http://www.creativepro.com/article/dot-font-hermann-zapf-at-87\">article
    about Hermann Zapf and the development of the Palatino nova family</a> for creativepro.com.\r\nF"
