  body: My money is on <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=regular&q=Go">Regular</a>
    from Gestalten. They also did <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?font=blender&q=Go">Blender</a>
    which is more chiseled.

  body: "Great shot CreativeNRG, I just checked \"Regular\" and I can't find any discrepancies,
    I think that's exactly it. I was already aware of Blender so that's two I'm interested
    in from the same foundry. Why do you say the quality is poor Thomas, I'm not a
    typographer but I've been a graphic designer for two decades and I can't see any
    problems, educate me please if I'm missing something.\r\n\r\nCheers both of you
    for taking the time to respond."

  body: "Perhaps I was being overly hasty, but there were two things that made me
    assume that it wasn't likely a regular retail font.\r\n\r\n1) The slightly clunky
    transitions of curves to straight lines are pretty typical of average \"free\"
    fonts, and almost never seen in decent quality retail fonts.\r\n\r\n2) Making
    the horizontal strokes the exact same thickness as the vertical strokes. If they
    want them to *look* the same thickness, they should make the verticals a bit thicker
    than the horizontals, to give the visual appearance of a constant thickness.\r\n\r\nThese
    are both typical beginner mistakes in type design. I suppose they could be doing
    these things knowingly and on purpose, trying for a deliberately naive look. They
    succeeded well enough to fool me at first glance.  :/  First time I've been wrong
    when I expected something to be a \"free font.\"\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: OK, thanks. Having vertical and horizontal strokes of the same weight suits
    me for digital display because of the low res output, the optical correction you
    refer to won't show up at 72dpi, however I understand your point. Thanks for explaining.

  body: "It may suit you, and of course you can choose as you like. But it creates
    a visibly \"wrong\" result. The optical correction I refer to is quite visible
    at 72 dpi, including in the sample shown, which is how I noticed it as a problem
    in that font. We're talking something like 5-15% difference in stroke thickness,
    which in the sample shown would have made a difference of 1-2 pixels.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
