  Doesn't have to be necessarily blackletter-styled type.. looking for whimsical,
  fantastic, and the like. Also any guidance on where to find such old storybooks
  ie. specific libraries/shops in the Los Angeles area would be helpful as well.\r\n\r\nA
  few crude examples: [[http://www.toysintheattic.biz/products/agg/40100_storybook_storytellers_puzzle.gif|1]],
