body: does anyone know how to get python talking to fontlab on the mac? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
  running mac os 10.3.3, fontlab 4.6, and macpython 2.3. I can&#39;t seem to get the
  &#34;macro&#34; option to show up via &#34;view/toolbars/&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  been trying to get python to work with fontlab since version 4.5 came out, and have
  just given up each time. <BR> <BR>anyone else go through this?
