  board. I, being the artist in the family, am the go to guy for doing this. Usually
  its easy stuff, Times Roman, Palatino, Trajan, but this...would have to be totally
  recreated. I am not getting paid for this. Any help figuring out what typestyle
  this is would be vastly appreciated! I'd rather not tweak 2 or 3 hours worth of
  bezier handles if I can avoid it. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo
