  may find this interesting.\r\n\r\nA copy of the New York Transit Authority Graphic
  Standards Manual, designed by Massimo Vignelli of Unimark International in 1970,
  was found recently and has been posted. Each page can be clicked for an enlargement,
  and you can roll over with your cursor to magnify further.\r\n\r\nhttp://thestandardsmanual.com/grid.html\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/manual_5590.jpg]"

  body: "Interesting that they use \"X height\" to mean the height of the <em>capital</em>
    x.\r\n\r\nAlso, they give the sign-makers a complete kerning table! You look up
    a kerning pair by finding the first letter in the pair and sliding along the row
    until you find the cell for the second letter, and it gives you the spacing value."
