  what fonts were used for numbers and last names on their backs?\r\n\r\nI'm watching
  now game with Algiers against Slovenia and Algiers are using an font with bad metrics."

    some of the African nations in this World Cup. [[http://footballfashion.wordpress.com/2009/10/10/the-puma-2010-african-kit-collection/|There's
    an article here]] which says \"a unique brush-stroke effect, mimicking fans\u2019
    body paint, creates the decorative stripes on most of the away jerseys and the
    players\u2019 names and numbers on the back.\" \r\n\r\nIt's unique alright."

    Others.\r\nThanks. Those were Puma's jerseys like Jan wrote. Maybe it's just my
    eyes, but I think I saw a couple of times a very bad spacing/kerning on their
    backs (maybe it was just an error during the printing of their last names).\r\nIf
    you watch WC in SA, pay attention to Puma's jerseys. Maybe I'm hallucinating cause
    of bad result of Serbian team :) "

    I have to admit that the alternative lc a of the adidas font looks neat (see the
    pic Northbay posted)!\r\nAnd why puma seems to prefer all lower case on their
    jerseys. It looks feeble and meek next to an all caps shirt.\r\n\r\nPlus the adidas
    font lacks a capital eszett, no? Since name setting is one of the best reasons
    for its existence in the first place. Remebering the terrible H\xC4\xDFLER shirts\u2026\r\n\r\nI
    agree that the overall look of the jerseys is much better this year but as far
    as type is concerned they\u2019re still third division!"

    numbers are the most legible of the bunch: it's light enough, and tracked loosely
    enough to work from a distance. Those extra hooks on 'E' and 'e' and so on I'm
    not a fan of. \r\n\r\nBut as numbers go, others have made too narrow, heavy and
    tight versions."
