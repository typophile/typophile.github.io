body: "I've already spent three days with this design. I try to have a sedated version
  of Caslon, but not with a Dutch or French dryness. I also make this font with a
  tall x-height for newspaper use, where Caslon is seldom used.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cardinale2_4578.png]\r\n\r\nHinting
  this one is a bugger, but here is a pdf.\r\n\r\n"

    that 'cardinal' -fleuron, but now (after a hefty Jule meal) I am seriously thinking
    of italics, and weights as well\u2026"

  body: "Thanks, Danny-\r\n\r\nThis is still work very much in progress, and I was
    just lazy with the italic sample, therefore that fi ligature got in. I'm hoping
    to turn this family into a working tool for magazine and newspaper use with that
    relatively tall x-height."
