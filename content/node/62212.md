  body: Back in Ye Olden Tymes, when people did hand lettering, there was an abundance
    of instructional books for aspiring artists, and there was a lot of "borrowing"
    among the various authors. The earliest "probable influence" I can find in my
    collection is an undated (but probably early 30s) version of "abc of Lettering"
    by Carl Holmes. This is called a "moderne" style and, with the exception of the
    truncation of the bottom strokes on the 3 and 5, the letterforms pretty much match
    an alphabet on page 21.

  body: The book shown is a different edition (there were SEVERAL over the course
    of thirty or more years). The alphabet I was referring to is on page 36 of this
    edition.
