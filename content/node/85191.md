  body: "Often, the cent sign is present in fonts, but it is not frequently used as
    it is not accessible easily from the standard keyboard layout.\r\n\r\nI would
    very much like to see the standard U.S. keyboard layout extended slightly, so
    that the right-hand Alt key would serve as AltGr, so that even in the simple default
    layout, a few alternate characters used often enough in U.S. word processing would
    be obviously accessible - and marked on the keyboard.\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alts_4625.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
    \"U.S. International\" keyboard layout is little used, because it turns the quote
    marks and some other keys into \"dead keys\" for typing accents, which is awkward
    unless typing accented characters is the primary reason one is using that keyboard.\r\n\r\nWhen
    the ISO 9995 keyboard becomes more widely available, though, additional characters
    will be more easily available."

  body: "\u2117 is used in music publishing. Apparently -- and I've not researched
    this in any depth -- \u2117 is used contrastively with \xA9 such that the former
    refers to the recording and the latter to packaging. One of the things this enables,
    I suppose, is the original \u2117 date to be clearly identified when music is
    re-released with new artwork/packaging that has its own \xA9 date."

    a UK record label, but I think they were specifically referring to the use of
    the two symbols on e.g. CD packaging, hence the association of the \xA9 with the
    artwork.\r\n\r\nNice to see that the \u2117 illustration used on the Wikipedia

    2000, we were commissioned by Microcadam to produce a suite of fonts for their
    Helix CAD software. The fonts implemented both the ISO and ANSI standard lettering
    and symbols for CAD, and I was rather pleased with their quality. Unfortunately,
    very shortly after we delivered the completed fonts to Microcadam, the company
    was shut down. I don't even know who owns those fonts now; IBM took over some
    of the Microcadam assets, I believe, and encouraged users to switch to their own
    product, so perhaps they own the fonts."
