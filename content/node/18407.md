  or is there any digitised font like it.\r\nAlso, if anyone knows who designed it
  I'd be interested to know.\r\nThanks!"

    Penfolds Grange Hermitage label</a>  from the National Library of Australia shows
    a Penfolds label from 1967 with the same script, so I guess it's originally hand-drawn.
    Whether it's since been digitised, I'm afraid I don't know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Kyle, it would be best to start a new thread for Kiehl's.\r\n\r\nAs for the
    Penfolds lettering, I suggest P22's [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=IHT0000254|Brass
    Script]] as having a similar contrasty feeling, although the initials are less
    fancy. You might also look at Letterhead Font's [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ephemera.php|Ephemera]],
    for something more ornate.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
