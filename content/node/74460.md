  body: "Greetings, Stephen, thanks for the link-- Lamar Pen was somewhat similar,
    mostly in the \"T\" to the 1st attachment. Do you think it was hand written, because
    none of those matched. Also, I noticed p22 Virginian font has that same A, but
    not the rest... hmmmm...Thanks for your help!\r\nAnyone else with luck here? It's
    appreaciated.\r\n"

  body: Is it necessary to match it exactly? Why not use something finer and more
    convincing?
