  in photo 1.jpg and the all caps \"McMenamins Edgefield Ruby's Spa\" in photo 2.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
  font will be used for wedding invitations, and the wedding will be taking place
  at McMenamins Edgefield.  I have a call into their marketing office, but have been
  waiting a while to speak with someone. Thought I might try my luck on the forum!
  :)\r\n\r\nThanks!"
