body: "It was in the summer of 1982 that I, with the crucial guidance of my older
  brother, made my first \"typeface\": an 8\xD78 Armenian bitmap font on our newly
  acquired darling, the Commodore-64. Although the C64 was in fact our third computer
  (we'd previously had a couple of PETs) it was the first to open up this new world
  for me.\r\n\r\nI vividly remember penciling in the squares on grid paper, turning
  those into byte values, and entering all the numbers into the BASIC language's \"DATA\"
  fields. Sometimes it feels like it was yesterday.\r\n\r\nAnd here I am sounding
  like an old fart.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
