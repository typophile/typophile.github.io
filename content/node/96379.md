body: I'm looking for a more simple and clean looking Art Nouveau lettering, preferably
  relating to late 1800 (or so) France and would value any input you may offer. Auriol's
  namesake font looks a bit too mych like a stencil for my project. Something like
  DeVinne  or Letterhead's Billhead might work?
