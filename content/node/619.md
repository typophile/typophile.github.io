    <BR>TypeCon2003 News for Attendees <BR> <BR>TypeCon2003: Counter Culture <BR>July
    17-July 20, 2003 <BR>Radisson Plaza Hotel, Downtown <BR>Minneapolis, Minnesota,
    USA <BR><a href="http://www.typecon2003.com" target="_blank">http://www.typecon2003.com</a>
    <BR> <BR> <BR>Hello, everyone! We&#39;re in Minneapolis, preparing for your arrival
    at TypeCon2003. It&#39;s going to be a great conference! <BR> <BR>Below is some
    essential info for TypeCon2003 attendees. <BR> <BR> <BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------
    <BR>ON-SITE CHECK-IN &amp; REGISTRATION INFORMATION <BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------
    <BR>First things first - when we&#39;re talking about the Radisson, we mean the
    Radisson Plaza in downtown Minneapolis, and not the Radisson at the Metrodome.
    <BR> <BR>Since so many people have decided to get to Min <BR> <BR>Wednesday, July
    16, 3-6 pm <BR>Thursday, July 17, 8:30 am-6 pm <BR>Friday, July 18, 8:30 am-6
    pm <BR> <BR>Workshop attendees are encouraged to check in at the registration
    desk in the lobby of the Radisson on Wednesday to avoid being rushed Thursday
    morning before class. <BR> <BR>The list of the workshops and venues is at the
    bottom of this email. <BR> <BR>Walk-up conference registration is available at
    the Radisson on a space-available basis. <BR> <BR> <BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------
    <BR>WORKSHOP AND SPECIAL EVENTS TRANSPORTATION <BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------
    <BR>SOTA is providing shuttle buses to transport workshop attendees between the
    Radisson and the workshop venues &#40;MCAD and MCBA&#41;. The shuttle schedule
    will be available at the registration desk. <BR> <BR> <BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------
    <BR>BREAKFAST, BREAKS, &amp; MORE <BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------
    <BR>Continental breakfast will be available to TypeCon attendees Friday-Sunday.
    Food will be served outside the conference areas. There&#39;ll also be refreshment
    breaks twice daily &#40;coffee, tea, snacks, etc.&#41;. <BR> <BR>At Friday night&#39;s
    big event hosted by MCBA, Font Diner, and Penco, a casual dinner, cocktails, and
    non-alcoholic beverages will be provided. Food is coming from what many say is
    the best pizza place in town, so keep that in mind when choosing Friday&#39;s
    lunch spot. <BR> <BR> <BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------
    <BR>HELPFUL HOTEL HINTS <BR>----------------------------------------------------------------------
    <BR>If you&#39;re staying at the Radisson, there are a couple of things you should
    know. They just completed a major renovation, and the place looks great! When
    you check in, be sure to specify if you want a smoking or non-smoking room. If
    you want high-speed internet access, you need to specify that at check-in, as
    not all rooms have that feature. Smokers, be forewarned: there is no high-speed
    net access on the smoking floors. <BR> <BR> <BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------

    Center&#41; and I can&#39;t even afford the $$ to spring for a ticket.

  body: I know that now.  Got an email from Tamye telling me it wasn&#39;t too late.  Alas,
    my schedule has been set such that I wouldn&#39;t be able to attend anything.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m talking to Chank about meeting up with everyone when people head
    out for the evening.

  body: If you like beer and are coming to Minneapolis for typecon, try to get out
    to Town Hall &#40;located near the Metrodome in 7 corners&#41;. They brew their
    own beer which is quite good, and there&#39;s a nice outdoor patio if the weather
    cooperates.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure Chank will try to get you to venture into the
    land of Northeast Minneapolis &#40;his neck of the woods&#41; for some culture.
    Having lived in Northeast a few years back, I would say it&#39;s worth the trip.
    NE is home to a number of wonderful restaurants &#40;The Modern Cafe, Holy Land
    Bakery and Deli, The Sample Room, etc&#41; and some great dive bars &#40;Grumpy&#39;s
    NE&#41;. <BR> <BR>No trip would be complete without experiencing the local restaurant
    &amp; bar scene. Feel free to stop me for recommendations at any time during the
    convention. <BR> <BR>Looking forward to meeting everyone.
