  so long ago I made a thread asking to identify something like [[http://cl.ly/MHfV|this]].
  But it was just me looking for analogues early in the work progress. Although recently
  I've found very similar [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/moretype/rehn/|one]], but
  it was already too late to quit.\r\n\r\nI intended this for a paragraph-length copy.
  Quotes, openings etc. Originally it was an upright italic, but everything changed
  except /e slanted crossbar.  2 Masters, (prob.) 5 weights, Multilatin, Expanded
  Cyrillic. My first font being made with Glyphs. It's awesome.  Won't be going back
  to FontLab. \r\n\r\nNeris is a name of a river that goes through my city.\r\n"

    an Italic for it, don't feel bad, since Italics are over-rated, especially in
    a typeface with finely gradated weights. Related: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/stone/silica/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    link - different enough? And does any quirk catches the eye here? Except for /e-cy,
    it's middle bar was already lightened."

    mostly it's about self-education... Actually no, these days it feels like the
    Alamo.  :-/\r\n\r\nI don't think Rehn is close enough. But considering this genre
    has become pretty crowded their might in fact be something even closer out there!
    :-/  But as long as it's not intentional don't get paranoid about it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a lot of polishing. Right now I'm kerning the Cyrillic. Then will be working on
    italics.\r\n\r\n<strong>Just noticed nasty bug with /g, gonna fix it </strong>"
