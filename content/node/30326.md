  I use Kennerly in QuarkXPress, only the Roman version appears, not the Italic nor
  Bold, although all are activated. I tried to redo this layout in InDesign CS2 (in
  which I am rebuilding ALL of my layouts), but now Kennerly will not obey there either.
  Should I try and split the font suitcases apart, as was suggested in earlier forums?
  Anyone have a better font management utility?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    TextEdit?\r\n\r\nIf so, it is probably the application that is the problem. Try
    placing the fonts in the Libary > Application Support > Adobe > Fonts folder and
    launching InDesign again.\r\n\r\nIf not, it is probably the font manager that
    is the problem. Try placing the fonts directly in your [user] > Library > Fonts
    folder.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30240\">More on font managers.</a>"

  body: "I wonder if this is the old case of fonts. When some of the manufacturer
    did (Bold) (Italic) etc. and though only the Regular showed up - the rest were
    available by using the B for bold, I for Italic, etc.\r\n\r\nI remember when Fontographer
    1.0 was first out - they had a special extension so you could do this with your
    typefaces -- happy to say, I didn't and wouldn't ever touch it.\r\n"

  body: True, forgot about the style-linking issue. Does the font change to the proper
    italic when you hit the Italic button, Marty?

  body: "Brilliant! The fonts (all 4 variants) DID show up in TextEdit, but in InDesign
    bolding or italicizing the Regular did not work. So I copied the font family into
    InDesign's font folder and voila, there they are. Now, why don't they show up
    in Quark, even though the fonts are activated in FEx? Is there a workaround for
    that? And why does this happen with the rare font, most of them seeming to activate
    and deactivate properly, even in Dreaded QuarkXPress?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help
    guys."

    great, but it's still young and there are kinks to be worked out."
