    The sample is pretty small, but could it be '<a href=\"http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Categories/Text+Fonts/Typ1451/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Typ 1451</a>'? Nah.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dav.name\" target=\"_blank\">Dav</a>"

  body: "It's not Typ 1451. I don't remeber the name but it's listed in the <em>Most
    Beautiful Swiss Books</em> catalogue (2005). I just saw it last month. in fact
    there are no curves, if I remember correctly, it's composed of little straight
    line segments. Similar to the type that is generated with some weather charts,
    such as the ones found in some the University of Reading's Numeric Weather Prediction
    reports.\r\n\r\nSorry this isn't much help, anyway I think it's custom.\r\n\r\n"
