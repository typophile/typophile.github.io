  body: "Nick, me thinks no malice is intended \u2014 but what about setting up another
    (anonymous) account\u2026? That way you are \"not\" logged in as Nick, but can
    participate anyway.\r\n\r\nBTW I was reading the discussion re the new OTF version
    of ITC Avant Garde Gothic on this other site and I felt kind of *small* because
    the people involved were so knowledgable about the matter \u2014 even though I
    have been involved with type, typography and design for a quarter of a century.
    AND I have seen and read and appreciated all U&lc's for ages.\r\nMaybe I should
    set up some special *lurking* accounts to get rid of that feeling\u2026 hah!"
