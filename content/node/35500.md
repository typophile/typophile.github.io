  ID? I'm looking for a unique complementary typeface. Condensed, sans serif, serif,
  whatever you think works well. I'm hoping for something that compliments and adds
  more brand value. All the faces I've tried feel too blah and typical. Any help is
  greatly appreciated!"

    would work well with the ID. The ID is not getting re-branded...
