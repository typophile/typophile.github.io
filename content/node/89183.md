  on a project about a 1950s sexy, wreckless, fast, slutty, smeary red lipstick, hard
  drinking, hard smoking, voluptuous woman. Yes, she''s fabulous. I''m looking for
  the right typeface for her name. This Lolita face would work -- any other ideas? '

    to <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=rapier&q=Go">Rapier</a> or
    <a href="http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=laser&q=Go">Laser</a>. '
