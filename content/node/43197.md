  body: "FWIW, I searched MyFonts.com using \"1800s serif\" and found nothing very
    close. I also quickly browsed the Jaspert \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" without
    finding a match. I also searched my own Serif Font ID Guide and found nothing
    very similar in about 1,600 serif families.\r\n\r\nWhat can you tell us about
    the origin and age of the sample?\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for all your help. The only information I have on this type comes
    from the original letterhead, dated 1967. The company was established in 1728
    and are the oldest manufacturers of pianos in the world. At some point (as can
    be seen on the letterhead) they even had the royal warrant. The letterhead itself
    is pretty classy with all those added details (esp. the logo on the right 'national
    scheme for disabled men' \u2013 looks hand-drawn). I just love the style of this
    face, it seems so playful, especially on the lowercase, the overhang on the 'r'
    is just great!\r\nAny ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/broadwood_2_6024.png]"

  body: "Thanks for the image Rob, that gives a better sample of the typeface. Unfortunately
    my best resource is not very comprehensive on British typefaces, but I'm hoping
    an American version may have been produced that will show up in Mac McGrew's book.
    I'll report back if I find anything similar. My feeling is that this type is not
    as old as the Broadwood & Sons business.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I finished looking through McGrew's book, and found only a few other early
    20th century typefaces that had a similar feeling, such as Card Roman, Light Oldstyle,
    Pabst, Packard and Pencraft. Of these, I think [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-pabst-oldstyle/ltc-pabst-oldstyle/|Pabst]]
    and Packard have been digitized. Packard was done by Opti, I think, and as \"Paliard\"
    by NovelFonts (which I have).\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    they're not quite what I was looking for. I think this could turn into a project...\r\nCheers!"
