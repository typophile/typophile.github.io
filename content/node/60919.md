body: "Is there a typographical \"best practice\" for setting an academic year in
  a resume? Some of the things I have tried (in TeX notation [i.e. --=en-dash]): \r\n\r\n2006--2007
  AY  \r\n2006--2007 A. Y.   \r\n2006--2007 Academic Year\r\n\r\n'06--'07 AY \r\n'06--'07
  A. Y.\r\n'06--'07 Academic Year\r\n\r\n2006/2007 AY \r\n2006/2007 A. Y. \r\n2006/2007
  Academic Year\r\n\r\n'06/'07 AY \r\n'06/'07 A. Y. \r\n'06/'07 Academic Year\r\n
  \r\nMy main concern was that the en-dash would mean all of 2006 and 2007, being
  somewhat contradictory to the \"Academic Year\" part, and that the slash would be
  bad typographical practice without kerning. If I use the slash, would it be better
  to use old-style figures or lining? Space is a bit of a concern, so I really would
  like to avoid using the \"Academic Year\" version. \r\n\r\nThanks for any help you
  can provide. \r\n"

  body: I've always just used August 2006 - May 2007.  In any case, the norm to say
    "The Academic Year 2006-2007", so the typed/written one I (would) think would
    go along those lines.
