  name is just initials with the letters s, e, s, I've been playing around with different
  concepts but keep on getting stuck because of the duplicate \"s\" letters. \r\n\r\nThe
  goal is to create more of an 'Identity' than a logo, I'm thinking of implementing
  [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=vista%20sans|Vista Sans]] as the general brand
  typeface (a custom font would probably not be affordable).\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  or direction?"

    we need some questions answered ... :D\r\n\r\nplaying around = what exactly?\r\n\r\ndoes

    What *exactly* do they do? Who are their competitors? Who are their customers?</cite>\r\nThis
    is the interesting part, I can't elaborate much because some of the details are
    confidential, but here are the basics. They are a young and fresh think tank group
    aspiring to reach the american orthodox jewish sector just like other ethnic marketing
    agencies (e.g. WingLatino, Vidal Partnership, Alma DDB, etc.) are already doing
    with the hispanic sector for example.\r\n\r\nThey offer insight to a sector that
    corporate america cannot reach with conventional media, they serve as a link to
    a community which is mostly secluded from mainstream america. That is also the
    reason why they virtually have no competition to date, because they are from within
    this marketplace and are therefore very exclusive in understanding the language
    and subtle nuances of this specific market.\r\n\r\n<cite>what are they currently
    using for a logo? Where are they based?</cite>\r\nSee previous [[http://www.sesmedia.com/|link]]
    please.\r\n\r\n<cite>Do they want something monogram-ish?</cite>\r\nI don't think
    monogram style would be appropriate, I envision something 'corporate', a clean
    modern identity, I might be wrong but a monogram to me conveys a traditional printshop
    etc.\r\n\r\n<cite>Do they want a graphic device or just the three letters? are
    there periods between S.E.S. ?</cite>\r\nA graphic element would be cool if it
    could be incorporated, no periods between letters."

    There's much more flexibility and wiggle room with pencil roughs than with beziers.\r\n\r\nAnother
    idea would be to focus on the graphic and use a nice clean readable typeface.
    Looking at the other companies you mentioned, they all seem to have very safe,
    clean logos.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    The black version seems to have a candelabre scattered around in the negative

    out of that.\r\nIt might sound like I'm drunk but I'm not.\r\n"

    \"ambigram\" notion seem reminiscent of Jeremy Tankard's \"Blue Island\" typeface.
    (Adobe has it, if aging memory serves.) That might be an avenue worth exploring,
    too. Or maybe not. \r\n\r\nIn any case, have fun & good luck."

    the question is, does it work? Is it appropriate as a logo mark?
