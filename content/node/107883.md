  body: "Since you say this is a brand I must assume it is based on a font, thus modified.
    The very closest thing I can find which could be used to replicate this is [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501&page=59
    | Rvaturecu]] by Andrew McCluskey. It is a donationware font which means if you
    intend to use it commercially, Andrew expects a donation.\r\n\r\nThe logo appears
    to have been based on this font. If you remove the stencilling the letters match
    to the font except where they have been modified.\r\n\r\nI found several other
    similar fonts although none match as closely as Andrew's."
