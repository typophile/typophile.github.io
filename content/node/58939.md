  body: "Good work! You're providing a really good summary of what fonts are available
    where and multiple different options for font-stacks. The one thing I would really
    like to see are examples of the fonts in titling and body copy, since some stacks
    sit better in one or the other. \r\n\r\nOne of the things that I have noticed
    with these font stacks are that the fonts often set wider or heavier than one
    another, even at the same font size, so being able to predict those differences
    would be useful. Here are some more sites that I've found useful: \r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/article/eight-definitive-font-stacks/\"

    also makes use of the idea of stacks to help save on page weight:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/beautiful-fonts-with-font-face/\"

  body: Hi Aaron. I intend something like that to be the follow-up. Hopefully a few
    different text sizes (9-12 px) with a display size (24px). It'll take a lot of
    work, especially with the Linux fonts.

    might want to use one of those screenshot factories, like browsershots.org. That
    way you can quickly get comprehensive coverage of a ton of OS/browser configurations.
    I use such sites quite extensively for testing web designs FWIW."

    is displayed in Lucida Grande because I don't keep any, except the most essential
