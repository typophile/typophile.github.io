    and the second one is <a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/themix/">TheMix</a>.
    The numerals on the first image could be lower lining tabular figures of TheSerif.
    See <a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/theserif/theserif/features/">here</a>.
    Or those could be from <a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/theserif/theserif-office/features/">TheSerif

  body: "Nevermind \u2013 I've checked out a few PDFs from swisscom.com and while
    they do use a customized version of TheSans (called TheSansSwisscom) for some
    text, they use an apparently standard version of TheMix. Not sure about the numerals
    in the first image."

    in the pics is most likely not customized, but plain ol' Thesis. My bad. Akira
    gets the credit :)\r\n\r\ndoj: I'd say the \xAB2 bips\xBB font is TheSerif (TheMix
    doesn't have serifs on the \"s\").\r\nYou can try them out here: \r\nhttp://www.lucasfonts.com/typeshow/?ts-font=TheSerif&ts-style=Plain"
