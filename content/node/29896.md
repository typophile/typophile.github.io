    there's one in there called Cuca that looks exactly like this one...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Man, I'm not sure what language that site's in. Seems to SpanItaliaguese
    -- some hybrid romance language that's developed in a remote corner of the iberian
    peninsula.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the part that's in Spanish says this is an exclusive
    font for the Tuc-Tuc company."

  body: Using <a href=http://yubnub.org>YubNub's</a> guess command suggests that the
    "Spanitaliaguese" is Catalan. Sounds right to me. I'm no help on the actual font
    problem, I'm afraid.

  body: "Catalan is indeed sort of funny - but it's certainly not from a \"remote\r\ncorner\"
    - it's the language of the richest (in many ways) region of Spain\r\nand arguably
    of the design capital of the world, Barcelona.\r\n\r\nStephen, the thing is that
    on Spirelli's link it says TucTuc was an \"exclusive\"\r\ndesign... If this is
    legit, either TucTuc was never actually picked up and/or paid\r\nfor (happens
    a lot, even to people like Unger), or the exclusivity has expired.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hm, right. Great to have the light in Cuca, but shame that the Bold is not
    as black as in Tuc Tuc.
