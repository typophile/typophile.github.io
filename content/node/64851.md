    not <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/soft_sans_curve_to_corner/\">on
    this list</a>, the typeface in question is probably the result of a non-typedesigning
    graphic designer who tinkered with some poor font."

  body: "Florian, I think you put too much faith in that list. I would be very surprised
    if that list is very complete, as almost all of the similar FontShop lists I have
    seen are just a sampling of a particular style (and I think limited to FontShop
    availability).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Well, I should have added a winking smiley!\r\nIt\u2019s just that there
    is only a handful of good \u2018curve-to-corner\u2019 typefaces around. Most of
    the other sightings are like this one: swift corner manipulation, for a logo or
    a \u2018custom typeface\u2019. \r\nAre you planning an unbiased Bowfins Printworks
    Finger Sans ID Guide? Would be fantastic!"

  body: "It's an idea! \r\n\r\nHowever, I think I already have included some of this
    sort of font in the Script Font ID Guide, because the 'finger terminals' make
    them look more like brush-drawn lettering. Cocon, Maiandra, Textile and some other
    similar styles are already in the Script Guide. I'm always looking for sample
    donors Florian, if you want to make some.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Do you mean a font wanted 'waiting list'? There is one for the Script Guide,
    but I didn't have some of these Sans fonts on it, as they are rather borderline
    as Scripts, even in my broad definition. I'd like to also get them into the new
    interactive [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php|Sans Serif
    Font ID Guide]], which Jan and I are trying to bring up to date.\r\n\r\n- Mike
