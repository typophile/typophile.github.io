  font\r\n\r\nSomething with some solidity \u2013 \u2018Regal\u2019 is going to be
  printed on tshirts so preferably not a super thin fine font.\r\nI have really liked
  some fonts but the g looks very like a q. E.G. (Society Editor  - Like it a lot
  except for the g!! [[http://origin2.myfonts.net/b_91/u/ff/8928a201203d815107ef242b03d73b.gif]])\r\n\r\nSome
  fonts I like and why\r\n\r\nYMA Italic - [[http://origin2.myfonts.net/e_91/u/bb/2c1ba5f86e7ba014ed5d9797a1cbfb.gif]]\r\nReally
  like how the tail of the g is a sort of underline. \r\n\r\nStainy - [[http://www.dafont.com/stainy.font?text=Regal+Apparel]]\r\nLove
  how the R is recognizable and could be used as standalone R representing the brand.
  \u2013 the g looks very much like a q though!\r\n\r\nAnother font I\u2019d come
  across but didn\u2019t seem to stand out enough was\r\nPheonix Script FLF -[[http://www.dafont.com/phoenixscriptflf.font?text=Regal+Apparel]]\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  would be hugely grateful if you could point me in the right direction.\r\n"
