    From Presses</a> for sure! Okay, maybe it's not so instructive, but a good starter
    (but maybe less exciting) is always the [[triumvirate]].

    short articles by various luminaries, written throughout the 20th century, so
    it gets the reader close to original critical material, without having to do the
    research.\r\nBut it's only a paperback, and you can probably get it for $5 on
    the Net -- old books are so cheap now, the drag is paying for delivery, and waiting
    for it."

  body: I second Daniels & Bright. I also recommend "The Typographic Book" by Morison
    and Day, about $100 in a decent used edition. And, to round out the "bigger and
    badder" theme, I'd go with the 1912 or 1923 ATF specimen book, about $250 but
    sometimes you can get lucky.

  body: "I'd recomend The complete manual of typography. Also an Adobe book, so be
    aware that there is a definite bias, as is with Stop stealing sheep.\r\n\r\nThe
    Mac is not a typewriter is a classic. Simple, and great for the layperson.\r\n\r\nA
    great specimine book is American metal typefaces of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nFontshop
    makes nice catalogues, and aparently LinoType has one coming out, for something
    liks $20usd, but from what I know it does not show complete character sets. That
    makes it more of an ad than a resource.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have it, definately
    get the Bringhurst book, but be sure to get the hard cover. The 2nd edition in
    perfect bound is a little too thick, though last time I checked only the 1st edition
    was available in hardcover. It has a nice red ribon for marking your page though.
    The major difference between 1st and 2nd ed is that in 2nd theres a larger  glosary,
    more specimines, and mebe a small section on something digital. I have 1st in
    hard, have seen the 2nd, and feel no need to buy it again.\r\n\r\nBetter still,
    I get to go hear Bringhurst speak tonight (at NSCAD University) and if its appropiate,
    I might be able to get him to sign it for me."

    Bringhurst adopts Wittgenstein's decimal system for his chapters?"
