  the typophiles...\r\n\r\nim currently working on a DVD for a production of Grease
  (which is set during the late 50s early 60s depending on who you ask) and being
  the nerd that I am I want to ensure that all the typography is Period sensitive.
  \r\n\r\nI know that Futura was around and Was planning on setting stuff in this
  but its a bit plain/boring/just plain not wild about the font. I was just curious
  as to what other fonts were around at the time?\r\n\r\nThe current design uses Futura
  for the chapter text (which is somewhat hard to read at such small sizes) and I
  was using the Tiki Script font from House Industries (I know its a recent font but
  it looked \"of the period\"). \r\n\r\nAny other suggestions for fonts FROM the era
  (or at least that look of the period).\r\n\r\nThanks very much."

  body: Grease 2 was explicitly stated in the script as being during the Kennedy administration,
    so it can be assumed that Grease was set a short time before. No later than 1962,
    which still puts it culturally in the '50s.

  body: '@eliason thanks for those. looks as though most are "50s" style which is
    great. However, does anyone know of actual fonts FROM the 50s/60s? I want to make
    Mark Simonson proud lol'

  body: MyFonts also has a search feature where you can specify "design date" "is
    before" "1960" etc. that might be worth playing with.

  body: "There's a rather obvious one that I won't mention as you probably don't want
    to use it.\r\n\r\nIf this is for titles and captions, I'd suggest that you look
    at old videos. If this is for things in the video, I suggest that you look at
    old advertisements and other documents.\r\n\r\nWhile you shouldn't use a more
    recent font, you're quite likely to find older fonts that were frequently used
    in a certain way in the 50s and 60s.\r\n\r\nI unfortunately don't really know
    anything about Grease, so I won't give any more specific suggestions."

  body: I would think that most of the display "type" seen in the 50s and early 60s
    was really lettering. So looking at old advertisements would give a good sense
    of what was being used at the time for display. But it would be lettering and
    not type.

    easily): 1950\u201359: Rockwell, Franklin Gothic, Century Schoolbook. 1960\u201369:
    Futura, Gill Sans, Goudy, and lots of other serif fonts. And, of course, the good
    old H., especially the bold condensed."

  body: "@paragraph -- perfect thanks. that looks like just what I needed. I'm sure
    I'm going overboard. It's a DVD for a Highschool production. No one will notice
    these details but me. Either way you guys have been a big help. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't
    want to commit the typographic crime of using non-period appropriate fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm
    thinking something along these lines:\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainterfontkit/viewfonts"

    gave to do the font thing.
