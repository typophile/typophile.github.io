  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've made contact with the guy responsible for this font: <A HREF="http://www.id.iit.edu/visiblelanguage/Feature%20Articles/Roxane/Roxane.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.id.iit.edu/visiblelanguage/Feature%20Articles/Roxane/Roxane.html">http://www.id.iit.edu/visiblelanguage/Feature%20Articles/Roxane/Roxane.html</a></A>.  <BR> <BR>He says he sent it to FontShop but they never replied. I told him I'd look around for someone who might be interested in developing it.  <BR> <BR>He also said, &quot;&hellip;at the moment Roxane only exists as a research tool not as a real font because there are no other weights, italics and not much punctuation; nevertheless I can send you a copy if you want&hellip;&quot;  <BR> <BR>It looks like a good project for someone into designing a useful plain sans family.  <BR> <BR>I told him: &quot;&hellip;If I get anyone interested in taking the job on then I'll insist that you are credited as the original designer and that you should get half of any sales - although don't expect to retire on the proceeds!&hellip;&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What I really like about Roxane is that its design is analytical - something very lacking these days. But Gluth is not so analytical that it prevents him from taking a leap of faith - and that's even better. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, the good methodology and intentions are largely marred by a misguided foundation. His main mistakes are that: <BR>1. He ignores the essentially bouma(word-shape)-based nature of immersive reading. <BR>2. He needs to consider conflicts among letters,   not just the letters themselves. <BR> <BR>What this adds up to is that Roxane hits its target in terms of legibility (where individual letter clarity is paramount), but not *readability* (where word clarity is central). <BR> <BR>Even so, it would be great to have it as a fully finctional font. As for FontFont, they only review fonts twice a year during a TypeBoard* meeting; but once they do, they let you know of their decision very quickly. He should still get a confirmation that they actually got his specimen, but he might have to ask for it. <BR> <BR>* <A HREF="http://www.fontfont.de/fffstuff/f_submit.html" TARGET="_top"><a href="http://www.fontfont.de/fffstuff/f_submit.html">http://www.fontfont.de/fffstuff/f_submit.html</a></A> <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for posting this article. It's a nice read and an interesting hypothesis. Interesting the way he highlights counterspaces as the primary factor in providing contrast. <BR> <BR>//joe</div>
