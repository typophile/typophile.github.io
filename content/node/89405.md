body: "While inspecting the various fonts in my MS Works, I have discovered that fonts
  vary in size. I do not understand this. If a very common font is selected, say Arial,
  and set at 12pt., the characters will be of a given size. When one selects other
  fonts, the sizes or heights may not correspond. I was under the naive impression
  that the pt. size defined the height, but this appears not to be the case. Any insight
  into this phenomenon would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nIn addition, is there an accepted
  convention about when one uses the term font instead of typestyle? The two seem
  to mean the same thing, but I find myself wondering which one to use in discussion."

  body: "It's a common misconception, jn22, that point size has some exact relationship
    to how a font looks in print. Details: http://www.thomasphinney.com/2011/03/point-size/\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure what \"typestyle\" would mean, but if you mean \"font\" vs \"typeface\"
    then I did a survey on that topic:\r\nhttp://www.thomasphinney.com/2009/04/font-terms-survey-results/\r\n\r\nSuumary:
    There is no consensus, but the majority opinion is that in today\u2019s world
    of digital typography \u201Ca typeface\u201D means the general design, including
    all its styles, regardless of how it\u2019s instantiated, while \u201Ca font\u201D
    means a single style of a typeface, such as Myriad bold condensed italic, in a
    specific file format.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: That is a good question, one I had not thought about. My initial response
    is x-height, because it statistically dominates the landscape of any given sentence.

    typewriters, such as Courier and Prestige Elite.
