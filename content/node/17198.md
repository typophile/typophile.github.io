  graphic design, and am looking forward to exploring this site more often. I'm still
  new to all this, but what I'm learning will compliment my work in the film industry.
  I'm in the process of starting up my own company and customized a seven letter logo
  from an existing font in Illustrator CS to create my own version, reshaping the
  letters the way I wanted them. In order to utilize the pre-built text effects in
  my motion graphic software, I need to somehow convert the custom logo text into
  a \"font\". \r\n\r\nTed at Fontlab was kind enough to route me here. He explained
  that this is not a simple operation, and as it's a one time thing, it makes the
  most sense to try and hire a typographer. Would anyone be kind enough to shed light
  on what's involved, and what the costs might be?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n~Chris"

    I understand you correctly, you want to take the seven letter shapes that make
    your logo and drop them into an otherwise empty font, so that the text effects
    can work with it. I think anybody with font software can do that without much
    trouble.\r\n\r\nI think Ted might have been thinking that you wanted to expand
    your custom logo into a complete typeface of the same style with a full character
    set."

    body: "Thanks Cerulean - yes that exactly right. I've been in contact with a referral
      through Fontlab, Joseph Treacy (www.treacyfaces.com), and think we may have
      worked something out. He seems great, and Fontlab has referred a lot of business
      to him, so hopefully I'm all set. If, for whatever reason, it doesn't work out,
      I'll check back to see if I can find someone here.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n~Chris"
