  I always use en dash OR em dash.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m scratching my head :(\r\n"

  body: When you see the double dash in a manuscript you should change it to an em
    dash.

    article</a> I was just reading. Because I think people use \"--\" when they don't
    know the HTML for an en (&ndash) or em (&mdash) dash?\r\n\r\nOh, and just to let
    you know, this question should have been posted in the General Discussions forum,

  body: "> the HTML for an en (&ndash) or em (&mdash) dash\r\n\r\nJust a point for
    reference. Both the entities mentioned above need a semicolon at the end. An entity
    without the semicolon works in IE, and perhaps in other browsers, but is incorrect
    and may not work correctly in all cases. An entity is defined as starting with
    the ampersand and ending with a semicolon."

  body: To be fair, the em and en dashes are typographic luxuries, and not everybody
    is aware that they have more characters available to them than what is immediately
    aparrent on the keyboard. A double hyphen is acceptable when all you have is a
    typewriter, and somewhat forgivable when using a monospace font as one often does
    for email, but an em dash should be substituted when it becomes available.

  body: "If you were on an old-fashion typewriter (manual or electric) and you needed
    to type a 1-M dash for your manuscript -- you did not have an M-dash to use. So
    it became common practice for the typist to use two hyphens to show the extreme
    pause.\r\n\r\nHowever, when this same document made it the \"professional\" typeshop,
    it was automatically changed to the 1-M dash it was meant to be.\r\n\r\nHope that
    clears things up a bit.\r\n\r\nAlso, don't forget one line under a word or sentence
    was for emphasis - the typewriter could do that fine...but they didn't have the
    italic counterpart that the \"professional\" used.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of instances
    from typewriter to typesetting we can go through just like this."
