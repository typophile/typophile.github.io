    or 5 typographic masterpieces that he would use and everything else didn't deserve
    it. If I can recall well he talked about Times NR, Helv\xE9tica, Bodoni and Garamond
    (ITC by the way).\r\n\r\nWhat a narrow view.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

  body: I've always had a lot of respect for Vignelli -- I don't necessarily agree
    with all of his views, but he's good at what he does. There's an issue of Print
    that has a great interview in which he states something about American designers
    always desiring something new as opposed to perfecting what you know is good design.
    He believes that he is continually refining his style through the use of grids
    and a select few typefaces. When asked about the similar look that permeates his
    work, he replied by saying his clients all "receive the fruits of his garden"
    or something like that. The Garamond he prefers is actually Monotype's, I believe,
    and he also likes Century (as seen in the architectural publication "Oppositions").
    He and Kit Hinrichs have a lot in common in my opinion.

    Typography 1</em>, 1994</strong>\r\n\r\n\"In the new computer age, the proliferation
    of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution
    threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few
    basic ones, and trash the rest.\"\r\n --Massimo Vignelli\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<strong>From
    <em>Our Bodoni</em>, World Typeface Corporation.</strong> 1989. \r\nType release
    specimen brochure\r\n\r\nOver the past 25 years we have wanted compatible serif
    and sans-serif typefaces. When Bert Di Pamphilis of the World Typeface Corporation,
    New York, asked us to design a new typeface, we told him that we do not believe
    in \"new\" typefaces, but that there was room for improvement on existing, classic
    typeface designs. We consider the ratio between upper- and lower-case Helvetica
    letters to be the best there is. We wanted to redesign Bodoni using a similar
    ratio between the cases, with short ascenders and descenders; and articulate the
    type in four weights: light, regular, medium, bold. We worked on this project
    with Tom Carnase, undoubtably one of the very best type designers in the world.
    We were quite pleased with the results of our efforts, and we plan to apply the
    same concept to a few other classic typefaces, such as Futura, Century and Garamond.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYes,
    I'm old, and I used more typefaces than Massimo!"

    think that Vignelly has been very successfu in marketing his design style, but

    I hope at the end of my career that you can look back and see more than 6 typefaces

    among the proliferation, there are many more gems available."

    own opinion. While Vignelli certainly has his points, he is also inherently flawed
    as are all humans. \r\n\r\nI looked at a lot of Vignelli's work recently, his
    plan for the New York Subway (considering what it once was) was actually brilliant.
    In some instances a firm grid structure is necessary. Where the flaw ultimately
    arose as I saw it, was the lack of flexibility on the plan. A plan too rigid will
    eventually have holes. Life is always in a state of flux, and city planning also
    needs to reflect that reality."

    Being brought up in Manhattan from birth through college, you might have an insight
    to my irreverant humor.\r\n\r\nI easily related to Lubalin's style of work, as
    well as being completely comfortable having beers and laughs with Ed Benguiat.
    As a student of design, I stood in awe of Bradbury Thompson, Paul Rand and yes,
    for a short while, Massimo Vignelli.\r\n\r\nThere are designers that approach
    each project with a clean slate and open mind, and there are designers that impose
    solutions with a kind of righteousness. I feel Vignelli and Aicher can be considered
    the later.\r\n\r\nThe sessions I had spent with Otl Aicher were enlightening.
    I came to view Aicher as an old Samurai, highly trained and skilled, a veteran
    of many battles on the design front, and faithful to a rigid sense of order. I
    may not have agreed with all of his solutions, but I respected his approach and
    his need to explore within himself.\r\n\r\nI have not met Mr. Vignelli, so I have
    no real basis for my impression, but I sense a sort of aristocratic arrogance

    hard battles than to live in a manor with fat royalty.\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\nYes,

  body: "I met Massimo a number of years ago (1976?) when he was working on design
    projects for the U.S. Government. I found him to be open, bright, and helpful--certainly
    NOT aristocratic or snobby. It is easy to be a Monday Morning Quarterback and
    dump on work done in previous times.  I guess some people feel that by dumping
    on someone, you can raise your own sense of worth. It is fine to disagree with
    his philosophy but you can't take away his right to have his own philosophy. Massimo
    chose to work with a small set of tools and he used those tools quite well in
    my un-reknowned opinion. I have seen plenty of designers out there over the years
    who have used every typeface known to man and poorly. There is no one way to work.
    How many types did most people use who were trained in the '50s? Yes, he was a
    modernist--I know that is a dirty word to some people around here and I don't
    want to start that battle again (if you do, just do a search and you will find
    it). \r\nBack to answering the question: \r\nThe work of Massimo's of which I
    am familiar, was clean, well thought out, and highly structured (in a good way).
    Besides the expected use of Helvetica and Bodoni, flush left on a grid, he also
    did a very nice redesign of Federal documents in a traditional style using Century.

    I reviewed the Century never seemed to worked right. Too much contrast and it
    looked too fragile for text, which is why, I believe that the typographic identy
    of the NPS deteriorated over the years (too many font substitutions in text applications).
    Thee was also a problem with exactly which Century was to be used. Different contractors
    around the country used different cuts of the design. The NPS had some customized
    Century fonts that I believe were based on ITC Century and had their spacing adjusted
    for 24pt and 36 pt use. (which sould have been text size for the wayside exhibits).
    I agree with William that the new fonts work better, but I am a bit biased.

    \ The point of the system was consistent look and feel. The only prayer of getting
    consistency in Government design is by speccing a type that is universally available.
    Government contracting procedures make design very difficult.  There are numerous
    clauses like \"or similar\" to open contracts to as many vendors as possible.
    Sadly, low-bidder rules.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
