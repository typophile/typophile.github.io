  body: "<cite>So how does this sign work in the daytime?</cite>\r\n\r\nI'd figure
    this would look much the same on a south-facing (in the northern hemisphere) wall
    at high noon, and skew throughout the day at other times, throwing the separate
    shadow elements out of alignment to make it undecipherable less than an hour out
    either way.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it would look like semi-random bits of wire sticking
    out of the wall."

  body: "So by using Arial is the artist being avant garde by acting in opposition
    to high-minded typography, or is it deliberately low brow by using the font of
    the great unwashed? Makes me wish I was still in school just to write a bullshit
    paper about it\u2026"

    3 default fonts installed on his CNC machine.
