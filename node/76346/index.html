		<div class="commentbody">This Guide is presented to help in the identification of the many typefaces that are similar (by design or accident) to the design originally created by the Austrian-born Herbert Bayer in 1925 when he was head of the workshop of Graphic Design and Printing at the Bauhaus school of architecture and art in Dessau. The simple, direct, geometric look of this art movement was helping to define the look of an era. Perhaps most famous for its influence on architecture, particularly in the buildings of Walter Gropius, Bauhaus "style" was applied to many areas, including furniture, industrial and graphic design, and printing. Bayer, like many artists and designers, fled the Nazis and left Germany in 1938. He came to the United States, continuing his career in graphic design. He died in 1985 in California. (This information came mainly from "Rookledge's International Handbook of Type Designers - A Biographical Directory" by Ron Eason & Sarah Rookledge.)

Two additional websites with material about the Bauhaus are: Bauhaus by Greg Flores and the Bauhaus-Archiv Museum (this site is in German, maintained by today's Bauhaus School). The latter site includes many pictures and detailed history, much of which can be appreciated, even without much knowledge of German. (My special thanks to "Aenor" from the alt.binaries.fonts (ABF) newsgroup for these links and some of the font samples. Thanks also to Melinda Windsor on ABF for font suggestions.)

The reason for putting up this exhibition is the renewed popularity of this style, as shown by the many font ID requests on newsgroups comp.fonts and alt.binaries.fonts by people looking for a font like one of these. In the current fashion of geometrically simple "Techno" fonts, these typefaces suddenly look "new" again. Funny, how styles can go in cycles, isn't it? There's also a quote about history repeating itself, isn't there? ( I also provide a free font ID service, if what you are looking for isn't in these samples.)

The typefaces on this page begin with probably the most famous Bauhaus type of them all, ITC Bauhaus, designed by Ed Benguiat and Victor Caruso in 1975. I have included samples from fonts that I have in my collection (I don't sell fonts -- I use them in my graphics designs), but there are many other typefaces that resemble the Bauhaus look. Some of those font images were scanned from books I have listed among my "References" and also from provider's font samples. Other font images were generously provided by friends from the font newsgroups. I know I may be stretching the resemblances, but I picked these faces as ones that made use of the same (or similar) geometric shapes used in Bauhaus.
