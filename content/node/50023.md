body: "Hi just wondering in FL5 how I can create a permanent substitution that makes
  all uppercase glyphs default to lowercase? This is because I have multiple subs
  for lowercase letters and they can't be easily accessed if the letters are uppercase,\r\n\r\nI
  don't want to copy the lowercase glyphs to the uppercase character map as I'd have
  to do all the subs again.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

  body: You should use composites in your lc slots and classes for the subs. Then
    it won't be too much effort.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback guys. \r\n\r\nI'm just getting into OT features and
    haven't tackled classes yet, I might look into implementing this.\r\n\r\nIf I
    was to go the calt route, will that automatically work in AI/ID, or does it have
    to be 'enabled' through the OT palette?\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: The calt way requires activating it through OT in design programs. Would be
    just as easy to just always change all text to L/C. I'll maybe give the classes
    thing a go if I get time.

  body: "Calt is by default \"ON\" in InDesign \u2013 that is why I mentioned it.\r\n\r\nBut
    if you dont need the uppercases you should really replace them as Christophe describes.
    That would be the real thing to do here :)"
