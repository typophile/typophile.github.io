  sort that was  built upon the \"personality of type\" or what kind of message/tone
  a chosen typeface says... it was made from a bunch of \"buzzwords\" such as playful,
  stern, serious, etc - each with a chosen typeface conveying the buzzword?\r\n\r\nIt's
  a shot in the dark but I figured maybe one of you fine folks could point me to what
  I'm talking about or know of something similar?\r\n\r\n"
