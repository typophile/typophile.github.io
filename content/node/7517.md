body: I&#39;ve done this a hundred times before, I have no idea why it&#39;s not working.
  I have a regular PostScript font, which has some extra, non-standard characters.
  I&#39;ve added some very basic OT features, and when I compile them, it either tells
  me that something wasn&#39;t expected and it&#39;s aborting because of errors, or
  it doesn&#39;t give me anything at all in the Output window, but the features don&#39;t
  compile. <BR> <BR>Right now, I&#39;m working with a font that has a single kerning
  pair defined in the OT panel. I can&#39;t get it to compile. No features with a
  checkbox show up in the OT preview panel. I&#39;m starting to get really impatient
  and I wouldn&#39;t want to have to do something irresponsible, what with the election
  already ruining the week/year. <BR> <BR>Someone please help, I&#39;m getting desperate!
  <BR> <BR>Many many thanks, <BR>Alan

  body: 'Third time&#39;s the charm: it&#39;s working now, but in a really strange
    way. <BR> <BR>I had to add more features in the OT panel for it to preview correctly
    in the OT preview panel. After compiling, checking features, and saving, I re-open
    the font to find that the features have all been scrambled. The kern feature has
    been smashed into the liga feature definition. <BR> <BR>Oddly enough, when I compile
    and test the fonts, they work! I&#39;ve attached a picture of what my two &#40;was
    three before I closed and opened the font&#41; features look like. Strange stuff.

  body: Adobe OT FDK &#43; FL Mac &#40;specially&#41; have some problems with handling
    of line breaks on OT panels. There is a mixture of various kind and sometime,
    it happen <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"
    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>There is not perfect solution to that. Open the bad features
    file in text editor and compare to good features file and try to bring it back
    when its correct.

  body: Alan - <BR> <BR>I feel you on the election/OT blues. I&#39;ve been sailing
    the same ship lately. <BR> <BR>As I&#39;m sure you know, this problem could be
    any number of things but <BR>recently I&#39;ve found that if I make even the slightest
    change to one <BR>of my classes the OT code will jumble as in your screen grab.
    <BR> <BR>Or, as JFP points, line breaks can cause the same thing. I&#39;ve found
    <BR>even extra spaces after lines of code can cause the jumbles. <BR> <BR>Or,
    even a third, can be the voodoo of the &#34;Add all glyph classes to OpenType
    <BR>feature definition code&#34; option under the Prefs panel. I might be insane
    <BR>but I swear that things turns on and off by itself. <BR> <BR>Hopefully some
    of this helps. When you get the features to work, save <BR>the file in a guarded
    vault.
