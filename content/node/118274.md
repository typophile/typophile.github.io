  body: "According to Solopedia catalog here:\r\nhttp://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/solopedia-v.htm\r\nthe
    only legitimate source to acquire <strong>Versatile Script</strong> is the \"Dover/Solo
    Grunge Book + CD pack\". I think is this one:\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Grunge-Display-Fonts-CD-ROM-Electronic/dp/0486999777\r\nbut
    you have to ask the seller if the CD is still available with the book, especially
    if you buy a used one.\r\n"
