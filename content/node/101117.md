  image and was asked how much I would charge to vector it ( in GBP \xA3). I think
  the font might be frutiger but I'm not 100% sure. I also don't have the license
  to frutiger and I'm not sure they do either.\r\n\r\nHow much money do you think
  I should be charging to vector a logo like that and what do you think I should do
  about the font license? Could I get away with just pen tooling it? If I vector this
  image for them, who is liable for the font? Could I get in trouble?\r\nIf someone
  else designed the font for them, am I allowed to effectively copy their work?\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    Purchase a license; if you don\u2019t need anything else from the family just
    the single weight. The job will be done so much faster and accurately. We have
    a saying here in Belgium that roughly translates as: \u201CAvarice betrays wisdom.\u201D
    (It rhymes in Dutch). :)"
