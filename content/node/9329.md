  body: The sample of Bean Sprout DNA below comes from Sign DNA &#40;<a href="http://www.signdna.com"
    target="_blank">http://www.signdna.com</a>&#41;. It is shown in Part 7 of the
    Script Font ID Guide. In my opinion it is closer than anything in the previous
    good suggestions from Yves here.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65709.gif"

  body: Oooh, <i>really</i> close, Mike. The general shapes are all there, it&#39;s  <BR>only
    in the details that there still are minor differences. Is that  <BR>good enough
    for you, Sarah, or do you need an exact match?
