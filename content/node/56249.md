body: "Anyone have thoughts on average page length/word-count for articles posted
  on the web? A cursory review reveals the following standards on news-related sites:\r\n\r\nNew
  York Times Article: 800 Words\r\nCNN: No Pagination, Article Length 1,000 Words\r\nInternational
  Herald Tribune: 800 Words\r\n\r\nSeems also like a lot of sites simply limit the
  length of articles written for the web (a good thing, but not always possible)."

  body: Commercial news site pagination has little to do with article length and everything
    to do with ad impressions.

  body: "Some newspapers break up their online articles into \"pages\" but give the
    reader the choice of seeing the entire article as a single \"page.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    prevailing wisdom is that brevity is better for online reading, but as you point
    out, some content demands length -- short attention spans be damned. ;-D"

  body: "A distinction needs to be made between \"articles posted on the web\" (at
    the start of the question) and \"articles written for the web\" (at the end of
    the question); I've just randomly picked one of our academic journal articles
    <em>on</em> the web and checked the word count of the HTML version: about 7000.
    But it wasn't written <em>for</em> the web, it was written for the print issue...\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver
    since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working."
