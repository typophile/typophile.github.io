    \ Well I was not sure how to say what I was asking.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI just wanted
    to be sure that if the typeface Bliss is used in an identity system the next logical
    replacement font for web and MS Office use should be Gill Sans.  Looking at other
    identity style guides I kept seeing Arial, Tahoma, and Verdana as the replacment
    font for web and office application use and thought is that right.  I just basically
    wanted comfirmation from someone experienced in typography.\r\n\r\nIf one were
    to do a google for \"Bliss font and identity guidelines\" you would see what I
    mean.\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nI know I am
