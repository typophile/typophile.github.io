body: "Hi Everyone,\r\nI was wondering if anyone could help me with some font suggestions
  that might look great for lettering on the side of a 25ft fishing boat.  The title
  is going to be \"Dub-Sea\".   (He is from West Chester, and they call west chester
  dub-c, for w.c.)  So any ideas would be great, I was thinking of a deco flair but
  I don't have any experienceat all in this area.  It can be a really fun font and
  he is really open minded.  Thanks ahead of time.\r\n\r\nErin"

  body: "I recently saw a boat in some crime investigation show marked in Orbus Bjorkus.
    It used to be a free font from [[http://www.chank.com|Chank]], but there is no
    reference to it there anymore. It has popped up elsewhere, but I'm pretty sure
    that's in violation of its license.\r\n\r\nYou might like something else he has
    there. Almost any would make for fun boat lettering."
