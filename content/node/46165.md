  place in New York. I came up with something that was an homage to Saul Bass. The
  director liked it, but he was worried that it looked too old-school since the play
  is set in modern-day New York.\r\n\r\nSo my question - do you have any examples
  of designs or styles that would convey \"modern-day New York\"?\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Lex, could you post what you showed the director? Maybe that will help generate
    some comments.

    But, I can say the thing about New York, from my outsider''s perspective, is that
    it will probably always have old world charm. I mean, think about Woody Allen.
    He makes movies based on that mystique. No? '

  body: "That's interesting Miss Tiff...the Windsor Light Condensed (now available
    from Bitstream) Woody Allen has used since the 1970s has become iconic because
    he used them, it seems to me; at the time the choice seemed to us rather arbitrary,
    just a popular typositor display face that went with the Dixieland soundtrack
    with him playing on it.\r\n\r\nWe don't know more about the subject matter here,
    so let me note three ways to go, depending on that subject matter:\r\n\r\n--distressed
    or grunge type, suggesting graffiti or faded wall ads; there are tons of those
    about, many of them free downloads (just put \"free fonts\" in this site's search
    window and you'll get a fabulous vetted list of free download sites). Among the
    pay fonts are DF Forge and Battery Park, both from Veer\r\n\r\n--deco or moderne
    fonts like Mostra, Binner Gothic, Romeo, Huxley Vertical, Bernhard Gothic (best
    from Spiece Graphics), various takes on Johnston, Neutraface, and Burin Sans.
    Nick Curtis has marvelous deco/moderne faces for little or no money; check them
    at MyFonts or the Nick Curtis download site listed on our free fonts resource
    page.\r\n\r\n--Donald Trump piss-elegant, like Trajan and related high-society
    Charlotte York looks "

  body: I was going to suggest the ubiquitous Gotham which was designed with New York
    in mind. But it's great that the director went with your concept. Hewlett Packard
    used a Saul Bass-like treatment for their recent ad campaign.
