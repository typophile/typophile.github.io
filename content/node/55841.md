  body: "I have seen more than a few places (not so much fonts, but other sorts of
    software) that promote a \"Free Download\" of software that is useless in one
    way or another until you pay them. That they don't charge for initial downloading
    is enough in their minds to call it \"free\". I do not agree with this and consider
    it a shady business practice.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, as you were saying, many free
    fonts do carry the license you speak of, using nearly the same words you do in
    your question. No thick legal mumbo-jumbo. It doesn't offer much protection, but
    will at least make courteous repackagers ask first. Be sure to include contact
    information, including an email address you can be contacted at for years to come."

    attorney who is conversant in these matters, and stop asking legal advice from
    a forum that can't possible give it to you.\r\n\r\nOr do you think that you can
    get something here for free?"

    lawyers and free fonts don't really work well together.\r\n\r\n> Or do you think
