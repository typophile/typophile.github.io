  I'm looking to purchase a A4 Postscript printer (not an emulator) to proof my type
  with. I have a smallish budget and am unsure what to go for. I would normally post
  the quesion at said electronics store, but I need feedback from type designers as
  opposed to sales people. I look forward to the feedback \u2026"
