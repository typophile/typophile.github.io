  body: "Well, actually it looks like the freebie predates the Fontdiner offering.
    And it cites its source as \"Traced from the Dover book: Brushstroke and Free-Style
    Alphabets-100 Complete Fonts\". \r\n"

  body: "Sorry, you're right, my answer was not complete. Actually I found the exact
    one but this freebie was blatantly close to Refreshment Stand, I took the conclusion
    to consider it as an illegal rip-off. That's why I decided to silence the match
    name and to credit Refreshment Stand for being the source of your sample. \r\nTop
    the rip-off freebie, bottom Refreshment Stand with main difference for your sample
    is /o-/m connection.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_3961.png]"
