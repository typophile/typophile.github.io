  that the vertical metric lines(sidebearings in the FontLab Metrics window) in Macs
  are different than in the PCs. On PCs its almost invisible and doesnt distract when
  am doing spacing or kerning but while on the Mac I really find it annoying seeing
  that thick dotted line.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4924.jpg]\r\n\r\nIs
  there a way in FontLab I can adjust the visibility of the Metric lines?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your time.\r\nSatya\r\n"
