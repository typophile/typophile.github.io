  analysis of helvetica and univers and i worked my way through various letter to
  x where i found some strange going ons i wanted to see how the stroked lined up
  cause univers looked offset, so i dropped them into illustrator, expanded them,
  chopped them and extended the lines and this is what i found:\r\n\r\nhttp://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f291/crazyreaper/Helvetica-to-Univer-Comparison.gif\r\n\r\nnothing
  lines up, helvetica does a lot more than univers, most of the lines in univers aren't
  even parallel, anyone else find this otherwise the last 2 thousand words are useless
  cause i might be using dud versions\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n"

    get it. "

  body: Matt, this is called "optical correction" and all professionally designed
    typefaces incorporate these elements into the letterforms. It has to do with positive/negative
    space, and making the letterforms appear balanced when in fact there are these
    small details that are measurably different. For a quick example, draw a square
    and a circle the same height and width. The circle will appear smaller even though
    it is the same height. This is why letters like O and Q, etc. have "overshoot"
    and actually extend past the height of the other letters.

  body: "The way x's are usually constructed in typefaces has to do with a well-known
    optical illusion. Here is a simple example: Using only your eyes--no cheating
    with a straight edge or tilting your screen at a more advantageous angle--which
    of the two diagonal line segments on the right looks most like it is a continuation
    of the diagonal line segment on the left?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/illusion_4925.gif]\r\n\r\nAfter
    you have decided, check your answer with a straight edge."

  body: 'One other thing: The amount to which this is done depends on how thick the
    strokes are. On a bolder typeface, the amount of compensation is greater; on a
    very thin typeface, maybe none at all. The amount also relates to how far from
    perpendicular the two main strokes are in relation to each other. The amount will
    be most extreme in a very bold condensed typeface.'

  body: wow, thank you very much guys for that help. i just never expected them to
    be that far out, was worried that the type file i had was some dodgy 3rd part
    look a like and you have given me a lot more to talk about on the letter x, thank
    you :)

    to a spam post that showed up in the middle of this thread. Yves is a moderator
    and quickly removed the offending post (actually post*s*, plural, since they showed
    up in several threads at about the same time). \r\n\r\nBut because the references
    here are somewhat cryptic, once the post in question was removed, it might look
    to some like they're beating up on the OP.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the clarification.\r\n\r\nCan't blame us, we came across some
    pretty mean remarks on Typophile lately - especially towards those who are from
    non-English speaking background, ( ie, Asians- their lack of command in English
    probably make them appear to be \"stupid\"...hey, come on... Obama just won the
    election... :P ) as well as towards the students. ( I also do a lot of lecturing
    and thus symphatize with students who ask seemingly \"stupid\" questions- I am
    sure many of us can identify with that too...)\r\n\r\nMy apology to Theunis and
    Yves for the misunderstanding (especially to Yves- I just couldn't figure out
    how could someone at his stature be so mean and I almost get disgusted by that...)\r\n\r\nAlright,
    let's not continue to dwell on this and let's get on to some more constructive
    stuff...\r\n\r\n(BTW, Theunis- I am sure I like that beard too if I saw you on
    the street... )"
