  school where I teach.\r\n\r\nIt's limited on Cyrillic letters only, but maybe in
  future, we include Latin characters also.\r\n\r\nHope you'll find it interesting
  :)\r\n\r\n[[http://www.tourdefonts.com/Osmacka_azbukovica.zip|http://www.tourdefonts.com/Osmacka_azbukovica.zip]]
  (TTF only).\r\n\r\nP.S. - I didn't influenced them or gave any creative directions,
  my role was just to do a technical job - to make a font from their letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Osmacka_azbukovica0_4016.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Osmacka_azbukovica_5351.png]"

  body: "Thanks guys!\r\nThis was our first project, so that's why we forgot to include
    numbers and punctuation marks :)\r\nNext time, when we make school's website,
    we'll include Latin characters also.\r\n\r\nP.S. - It's funny, but some letters
    here are more original and creative then from much older design students :)\r\n"
