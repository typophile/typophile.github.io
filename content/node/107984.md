  lettering in \" La lettre dans la peinture et la publicit\xE9\" of J. Joveneaux,

  body: "The lettering was probably derived from the font Diament designed by J. Lehmann
    for Shiftgruss in 1937. It seems identical to Diament except for a narrower stroke
    width. Diament seems not to have been digitized.\r\nDon"

    Turnpike should work.\r\nIf anyone found better, let me know...\r\nSD\r\n"

    should be \r\nhttps://www.playtype.com/font/faux-occident\r\nBTW Playtype's flashing
    image is very offputting. Can't see how it helps sales.\r\nDon\r\n"
