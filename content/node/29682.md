  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/century-expanded/\">Century Expanded</a>,
  but it\u2019s not available on bold style, and it\u2019s bold. Also the small \u201Ca\u201D
  letter shown on the image has a longer tail than one of those on the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/century-expanded/\">Century
  Expanded</a>. Many thanks"

  body: "Yes, Coranto - you beat me to it. Arnhem by Fred Smeijers is very nice. Both
    designers come from Arnhem in the Netherlands and thus belong to the \u201CArnhem
    School\u201D, as opposed to the \u201CDen Haag School\u201D. This may explain
    a certain \u201Cstyle\u201D when looking from as far away as the US. Gerard sells
    some of his latest fonts only through his own website, not other distributors."

    are being <em>waaay</em> too literal. ;^)\r\n\r\nPosting alternatives is helpful
    on many levels, if only to show the person requesting the identification that
    we <em>are</em> working on his/her request. In the past it often happened that
    requests went unanswered for several days because no positive ID could be made.
    Because of that people sometimes got the (wrong) impression they were being ignored.
    I know the forum displays the number of times a post has been read, but it <em>is</em>
    kinda comforting to receive a reply saying something along the lines of: \"I don't
    know what it is yet, but it is very similar to this or that\".\r\n\r\nAlso posting
    similar stuff can jog someone else's memory, or inspire him/her to look at a specific
    location. We have had several occasions in the past where typefaces were identified
    thanks to someone posting a similar face, then someone else picking up on that
    and a third person eventually finding the actual face. For example, I have confused
    Coranto for Arnhem a couple of times in the past. Knowing that, Stewf's Arnhem
    remark would've made me check Coranto, and the case would've been solved.\r\n\r\nAnd
    last but not least sometimes it turns out the person requesting an identification
    prefers one of the alternatives over his initial request. For this very same reason
    the new FontBook now includes 7,400 cross-references (300% more than the last
    edition). These cross-references were updated and added by -- you guessed it --
    Stewf and me. :^P\r\n\r\nSo -- to conclude a very long comment -- as long as you
    make it very clear that your suggestions are indeed near-matches, not hits, please
    <em>do</em> suggest similar faces."
