  body: "If you're creating an entertainment website and you're not a designer, you'll
    need help not only with the logo but also the website design, fonts, colors, icons,
    advertising, and everything else, which all need to coordinate. \r\n\r\nIf this
    is a professional site then the designer's fees are part of your startup costs.
    If it's an amateur site your best bet might be to get a design student at a local
    college who'd be willing to work for free in exchange for getting  a nice portfolio
    piece.\r\n\r\nNot trying to be unhelpful, but designing a proper logo is a big
    job and requires more info than you've given. If you're just looking for some
    quickie ideas, google Music Logo (or whatever words best describe your site) and
    click the Images tab, and you'll see hundreds of existing logos (some good, some
    bad)."
