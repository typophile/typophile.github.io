  body: "Probably not, unless you're in the engraving business. This is a font built
    for an engraving system, and it's not executed well. The idea of having 3 \"lines\"
    define the heavy stems is that you use a thick enough cutting tool so that the
    3 lines merge to fill in the stem weight. The font wasn't designed to look like
    this. Also, it's simply slanted mecahnically, to achieve the oblique effect, it's
    not a true italic or even adesigned oblique. \r\nYou probably won't find a print
    version of a font to look like this, I'd guess."
