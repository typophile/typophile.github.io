body: I&#39;m having a problem in InDesign with automatic substitution of ligatures.
  The problem is that when I use FF Nexus &#40;PS Type 1&#41; and type out &#34;ct&#34;
  it will automatically convert into a ligature, no matter what ligature settings
  you use, i.e. turning off ligatures in character options.  <BR> <BR>Other combinations
  such as &#34;ff&#34; will turn off when I turn off ligatures, but &#34;ct&#34; will
  remain in ligature form. I&#39;m not sure if this is problem with the font itself
  or with InDesign. I could not find any options to turn off automatic glyph substitution
  that will prevent &#34;ct&#34; from turning into a ligature. <BR> <BR>Does anyone
  have suggestions? Please help! Thanks!

    problem, and FontShop built a new version for me that removed the &#34;s_t&#34;
    ligature. Not sure why the &#34;c_t&#34; ligature would show up, as it is placed
    in the historical ligatures set, but they should be able to help you.

  body: It seems that the version I have isn&#39;t an OpenType version of Nexus but
    a Type 1 version, yet InDesign still automatically replaces &#34;ct&#34; with
    a &#34;c_t&#34; ligature. I&#39;m starting to suspect that it&#39;s actual InDesign
    bug. Very strange.

  body: Talked to the boys here at FS today and they say the font&#39;s got <BR>these
    two ligatures &#40;&#34;st&#34; and &#34;ct&#34;&#41; set as Standard rather than
    <BR>Discretionary. This is something we will fix for future font sales,  <BR>but
    in the meantime, contact FS and they will send you new font data.

  body: Stephen, that&#39;s odd, my original version of Nexus had the c_t ligature
    in the historical ligatures substitution set, while s_t was in the standard set.
    Could there already have been multiple versions floating about?

  body: I&#39;m confused... would a Type 1 version of Nexus still have standard and
    discretionary ligatures? I thought that only OpenType fonts had those features.

  body: Yes, that&#39;s confusing indeed. However, as there is no way I know of to
    make either a ct or st ligature work automatically in InDesign without OpenType,
    I am wondering if you are mistaken as to the format you have? <BR> <BR>T

  body: I opened up the font in Font Book in Mac OS X, and the file format listed
    says it is a postscript type 1 font. I have read elsewhere that InDesign will
    automatically replace ligatures even in fonts that are not OpenType. I&#39;ve
    attached an image to this message. <BR> <BR>Also it looks like FontShop is offering
    a free downlof of Nexus Sans Bold on their site. I downloaded this and it is having
    the same issue with c_t ligatures in InDesign. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=virtual.content&amp;area=fonts&amp;content=fonts/free.htm"

  body: Weird! I just looked at the free Nexus Sans Bold in InDesign CS on Mac OS
    X. The strange behaviour appears for me as well.  <BR> <BR>FontAgent Pro loads
    it as a Type One. I opened the font in Fontlab, and couldn&#39;t see anything
    strange about it. It seems to be a Type One, with the c_t lig named &#34;c_t&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>The font functions as expected in Illustrator.

  body: 'I have run accross this c_t s_t ligature problem with Type1 fonts as well.  <BR>
    <BR>Another problem I run across in InD is as follows: Type1 fonts with a standard
    character set. The figures in the font are named with standard names; zero, one,
    two etc. The design of these figures are of an oldstyle form. Also in the font
    are a set of Tabular Lining figures that are named zero.tab, one.tab, two.tab,
    etc.  <BR> <BR>The reason this second set of figures are in the font has  to do
    with the production process I used several years ago. Anyway now in InDesign,
    the program ignores the correctly named figure glyphs &#40;oldstyle in design&#41;
    and substitutes the Lining Tabular figures. &#40;Even though they use a non-standard
    name&#41;. <BR> <BR>Charming huh.'

  body: I am certainly glad I&#39;m not alone with this ligature problem! I thought
    I was just going crazy!  <BR> <BR>So then is the only way to correct this c_t
    ligature problem, with Type 1 versions of Nexus, is to delete the glyph completely
    from the font file? Or bitterly complain to Adobe and have them fix InDesign?

  body: Interestingly, it doesn&#39;t seem to happen with the TrueType version. Very
    odd, all this. I am making some inquiries. Perhaps we can fix it in the future.
    <BR> <BR>That being said, this phenomenon of having unencoded glyphs like this
    kicking around in a Type 1 font was pretty uncommon until recently. Now that people
    are making OpenType fonts, they may want to have a single source file from which
    they are generating multiple font formats. Thus the problem. <BR> <BR>Cheers,

    renamed &#34;ct_lig&#34; and the problem disappeared. No surprise there, I guess.
