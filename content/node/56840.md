  body: "I think it looks like one of the [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013|H&FJ
    Knockout fonts]]. #69 seem close, but I always have trouble separating all these
    weights. I see the center arm on the E is shorter than the other arms, unlike
    your sample, so it may not be the right font, but it could be made to look very
    close with some editing.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    you sure? \r\nThe proportions look slightly different. In your sample the \"F\"
    seems wider, the \"Y\" narrower than in the AG style you quote (at least as seen
    on MyFonts <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-bq/\">here</a>).\r\nAlso,
    if it is AG, I think it has been artificially boldened. Look at the counter of
    the \"A\".\r\nThen again, the sample is kind of small, and I'm tired. :o)"
