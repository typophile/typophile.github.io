    None). So, assuming they think no one reads this stuff, why print it at all, or
    use Times at the same ht. as Garamond. '

  body: "Garamond, Century Gothic, Ecofont... but none of them are designed for dyslexics!\r\n\r\nSome
    die-hard typographic conservatives feel that the only decent typeface is some
    form of Jenson - as Poliphilus and Bembo are much inferior, and so are Garamond
    and Caslon... with nothing else worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nI just remembered - while
    the Bitstream collection that comes with Corel products doesn't have any Jensons
    I can recall in normal faces, and it doesn't have Cloister Oldstyle or Cloister
    Lightface... it does have Cloister Open Face. That would <em>really</em> save
    ink, and it would be a form of the One True Typeface!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh, silly me.
    I forgot Venetian 301, which is like Centaur, which is also considered a Jenson
    of sorts. And unlike Morris' Golden Type and its imitators, it is fairly light
    as well, so it is another alternative."

  body: The student's idea is that all printing is done with exspensive printer ink
    - cheap newspapers in Europe used to be printed letterpress using used motor oil
    and carbon black - now that is cheap ink. But then you had to wash your hands
    after reading - not a bad idea anyway.

    course, you were thinking of fish and chips wrapped in the cheap newspapers cited.
