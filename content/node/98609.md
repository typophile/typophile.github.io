body: "I know. The subject is a mess but as a typography noob, I just didn't know
  how else to word my issue. Perhaps an image would be better.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alignment_6487.png]\r\n\r\nI
  need the entire alphabet visually aligned within the orange box above. This font,
  as with many others, does not align with a text box, which then requirs manual nudging.\r\n\r\nI'm
  building a website that utilizes a user's input text (e.g. \"h\") that would impose
  on this design. The problem is that because the letters all align differently, it
  is causing a terrible output. \r\n\r\nMy question (to this fine typophile community):
  Is there some setting or attribute about a font I should look for to achieve what
  I am after? Are my hopes and dreams about automatic visual alignment simply that;
  hopes and dreams?"

  body: Do you mean vertically or horizontally centered, or something else? What software
    are you working in? Does the text have to remain editable as text, or are outlines
    enough?

  body: "Hey Luma, thanks for the reply.\r\n\r\nI mean vertically aligned. (the \"g\"
    in the example above is perfect.) \r\n\r\nI'm working in InDesign and the text
    needs to stay editable unfortunately."

    the top of the box as the bottom of the letter is from the bottom of the box? '

    the bottom and top of the box."

  body: "I don\u2019t think there is any alignment information in the font which is
    directly useful.\r\nHowever, you may be able to calculate how much of a baseline
    shift is required for each letter, and program that into the web site.\r\nAlternatively,
    use a lining typeface\u2014either all caps or unicase.\r\nHere are a couple of

    body: LINING! Thank you! I've updated it to just take all caps. Desired outcome
      achieved! Thanks Nick and everyone.
