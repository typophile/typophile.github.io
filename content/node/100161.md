body: "Hi there, \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve experience a quite fuzzy thing: Exporting a font
  two times from <em>FontLab</em>, no known changes in the output settings. \r\nThe
  1. font is the red text below, the 2. is the white text. \r\nThe only thing that
  was changed in between the 2. font-exports was the numbers (<strong>0 \u2013 9</strong>)
  and the punctuation (<strong>,.;!?\u201C\u201D</strong>\u2026) not displayed here.
  \r\n\r\nIt appears to be that now the Bitmaps are not the same anymore (especially
  the horizontal stems in <strong>a, e, s</strong> and <strong>h</strong> in the attached
  300% example). \r\n<em>Anti-aliasing method</em> is set to <em>sharp</em> in <em>Photoshop</em>,
  but this it seems has nothing to do with the different jittering in the result.
  \r\n\r\nAny help or hint is highly appreciated! "

  body: If you are making a font and testing its quality in Photoshop, you're doing
    the wrong thing. Photoshop was never intended to be used for typesetting. Use
    a page layout program such as InDesign or an illustration program such as Illustrator
    to test your fonts; they don't rasterize the type.

  body: "Thanks for your reply, George. \r\nIn fact i do need to display the font
    properly in <em>Photoshop</em> as it is for a digital screen. The <strong>outlines</strong>
    still are perfectly matching \u2013 only the <strong>bitmaps</strong> are rendered
    differently. \r\nI think there is something wrong with the fonts <strong>weight</strong>
    and therefore its final interpretation as <strong>bitmaps</strong>, still searching

  body: "The characters you added might be affecting either the vertical bounds or
    the hinting. If it's the former, try making the leading in Photoshop constant
    (although there are more robust -but trickier- fixes that can be done within FontLab);
    if it's the latter make sure you're not doing some auto-hinting before export
    (or just turn the hinting off).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "@George No worries, prints not dead ;)\r\n@hrant Alright, it seems its the
    interpretation of the vertical bounds and connected to that the hinting. \r\nI
    messed a test-file up with <em>autohinting</em>, which worsened the effect \u2013
    I will try to turn off the hinting all over. \r\nThe source of this error is not
    PS. The displayed font is generated digitally on a screen, so no work around possible. "

      Photoshop just displays the malfunction the font\u2019s got when it comes to

    I suppose I should ask if this is otf or ttf? I assumed otf. "
