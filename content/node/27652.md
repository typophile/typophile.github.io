  body: "I would suggest making the 'n's one piece instead of two distinct strokes.
    Same with the 'r'. The second 'o' in \"Hookah\" should probably connect to the
    'k' to reflect the flow of the original logo.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I think you should work another way of joining (or not) er in dinner and
    work in some more colliding the letters as the logo. What kind of scale do you
    think the headlines and the logo will work at together? I ask because the stroke
    weights might seem a bit at variance when seen together, I also get the impression
    of the characters leaning to the right slightly more than the logo. There is something
    about the g which is bothering me it seems a bit out of character.\r\nTim"
