  It's for a class, and it's due tomorrow. I've been developing this monogram for
  my initials TR, and I've sketched and sketched my ideas for that, and I've come
  up with these variations so far.\r\n\r\nI wanted to have a geometric sort of design,
  and balanced, and I've done that with these, but the readability is still really
  bad. I used a lower-case t and an upper case R to create a sort of mirrored image,
  square in shape, and with 4 sections inside to give it even more balance. I like
  the way #7 balances both sides exactly, but the t is always the tough part to get
  it to be easier to read without making it unbalanced.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm thinking
  I'll have to add the left part of the cross on the t, even though it would take
  away from the balance, but I can't think of any other way to get this thing easier
  to read without doing something like that.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas on
  how to get it to read easier, and be relatively balanced on each side?\r\n\r\nBy
  the way, I'd rather go more balanced than more readable, since I would always include
  my name next to the logo, but I think it needs a lot of help with reading it still.\r\n\r\n-Thanks\r\n\r\n-Troy
  Ruprecht"

    working in black and white to work out the relationship between the two letters,
    then add color later. \r\n\r\nGood luck![img:sites/default/files/old-images/sketches8_4039.jpg]"

    usually do in a professional environment. The only possible setback is a grade,
    but don't worry about that. What really matters in school is how you explore things.
    \r\n\r\nYour sketches look very limiting. If you try doing what Alaskan mentioned,
    you will start expanding your linear thought process. Keep pushing that further.
    You'll develop a lot more styles, more sketches that are different, and ultimately
    find something unexpected you might not have been able to predict. I can see this
    mark go off into a number of ways beyond this style. What might be lacking is
    how you're going to place your name within the mark. Make sure each sketch is
    a full sketch and has everything in it that you need (ie: main mark, secondary
    mark, maybe even a third mark, colors, shapes, etc. etc.)\r\n\r\nIf you keep yourself
    limited to this thought of \"more balanced than more readable\" you're only going
    to hurt yourself in the end.\r\n\r\nBest of luck,\r\nJohn"

  body: "I really like #7.  Why do anything more to it? \r\n\r\nI agree with Alaskan
    that you should look at it in black and white first, though.  I'm not a fan of
    the rounded/sharp corner shape your using.  It only creates a less memorable overall
    outline of the symbol.  Your line weights are heavy enough, and the two forms
    are balanced enough, that they shouldn't need it."
