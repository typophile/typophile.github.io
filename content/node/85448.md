body: "Hi, I've been looking for this font.  I'm thinking that given it looks like
  handwriting, odds of finding it are low, but I'd like to give it a shot here.\r\n\r\n<img
  src=\"http://typophile.com/files/salvador_0.PNG\"/></image>\r\n\r\nIf it helps,
  I found this font in a Sweet Valley Junior High novel published in 1999.  The series
  utilized other fonts like Biffo and Spring Light, so I know it's a font and not
  drawn handwriting.\r\n\r\nI think the font's most notable feature in the sample
  I have is the way the lowercase 'v' over-arches to the right more because I can't
  find any other fonts that do that.  Also noticeable for me were the \"tails\" on
  the lowercase 'a' and lowercase 'd' and I guess the \"dot\" in the lowercase 'o'.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for any help.\r\n"

  body: "I'm afraid that isn't the font I'm looking for.  The lowercase 'v' doesn't
    quite match, and there's no gap in the lowercase 'a' near the top.\r\n\r\nIt does
    resemble the font though.\r\n\r\nThank you for trying."
