body: Can anyone identify the font for 'Lyons' please? I can't decide if it's an actual
  font or someone has touched up another one.

    (mainly because of /y ball terminal tail).

  body: Yes, it's one of the ones I looked at (among about a thousand others!) but
    I'm struggling with the top serifs on the /y and peculiar 'L'

  body: Great job. I was more concerned with identifyng it though in case they want
    more types of artwork. Wish these people would ask their designers more questions!

  body: "I guess it would be very easy to modify it, mainly removing some serifs:\r\n-
    remove /L top right serif and round angle\r\n- rework inner transition between
    vertical and horizontal stem\r\n- remove /y inner serifs and round angles\r\n-
    remove /n arch inner serifs\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lyons_5361.png]"

  body: "Andy, FYI if it <em>is</em> an actual font it's probably illegitimate since
    virtually any Baskerville cannot be redistributed (and many -maybe most- of them
    can't even be modified \"internally\").\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
