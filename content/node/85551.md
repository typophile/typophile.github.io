  | Fontspring]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/bronzetti/ | Myfonts.com]].\r\n\r\nBronzetti
  has been a long term project for Greater Albion Typefounders, aimed at filling a
  large gap in the range of typefaces available today. The Bronzetti family of 22
  text typefaces combines modern requirements for legibility and readability with
  the charm of traditional Roman faces in the spirit of those carefully constructed
  by small scale quality foundries such as the Kelmscott and Vale presses.  In short,
  Bronzetti is traditional letterpress meets modern publishing, offering a real opportunity
  to make your material stand out from today's 'run of the mill' crowd.  The range
  of typefaces on offer includes five widths of type, as well as small capitals and
  italic forms and regular and bold weights.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bronzetti_Poster1_5438.png]\r\n\r\nA
