  body: Hmm, this is somewhat tough. I usually use hanging figures, since I mainly
    do straight-text book work, but for technical manuals and such, lining figures
    usually look better. Nevertheless, I think most of the time I prefer hanging as
    the default.

  body: "In design work, OsF is probably the best \"default,\" but when you are producing
    and distributing an OpenType font, you absolutely should have the default set
    to tabular lining figures. A font is a tool for people to use, as many people
    as possible. Customers* are used to standards. And although I think that OsF would
    make the best standard, it isn't the standard customers have been living with
    for 20 years. \r\n\r\nAll other type of numbers are features. These days, features
    are easy enough to come by, at least for designers. Even Quark's getting on board
    now, since they've just released their public beta of XPress 7.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n*This
    may be controversial, and I don't have any evidence to back it up, but I think
    that graphic designers are not the majority of font buyers. They certainly aren't
    the majority of font users! Fonts are for everyone, designers and non-designers
    alike. We can agree on that, can't we?"

  body: I agree with what Dan says, in an all designer world I'd have 0 qualms telling
    you to use OSF as default, concuring with what I stated above. There is the big
    picture though...us designers know how to access the OSF and change our preferences
    to use those but the average user most likely doesn't and will definitely get
    confused by them!

  body: "When we came to make this decision for the Microsoft ClearType fonts, we
    decided to make proportional oldstyle figures the default since the fonts are
    intended to make on screen <em>reading</em> easier and we figured that what people
    would be reading most is continuous text. Later we revised this for a couple of
    the families, because Office wanted to give them a prominent place, meaning that
    they would be more likely to be used in business documents and places where people
    would expect tabular figures.\r\n\r\nFor a while, I was arguing in favour of tabular
    oldstyle figures as the default in all the fonts, but the MS ART people decided
    that we should go whole hog and make them proportional.\r\n\r\nDan, I hear what
    you are saying about user expectations and de facto standards based on longstanding
    convention. But when Microsoft are ships fonts with an operating system, that
    tends to have a pretty big impact on users' expectations."

    \"antique\" use of -- tabular lining numerals in text ...\r\n\r\nI simply regard
    oldstyle numerals as \"lowercase\", and lining numerals as \"uppercase.\" And
    all caps setting is kind of an exception itself, addressed by a feature like \"case\"
    which also switches to lining numerals.\r\n\r\nBtw tabular numerals -- I can well
    imagine that an intelligent future Word would select tabular (oldstyle or lining)
    variants automatically if they precede or follow a tabulator, or that an Excel
    would, without further notice, use the tabular variants of either oldstyle or
    lining numerals.\r\nAnd as regards oldstyle vs lining numerals in tables, Mr Noordzij's
    Letterletter nicely shows that oldstyle tabular numerals are quite readable. (Sorry
    for using this word.)"

  body: "I have published OT fonts with Tabular Lining as the default, which was also
    \"correct\" for the design, and those numerals look pretty good in running text.
    My next release will have Proportional Scotch-style - see \"Georgia\" - numerals,
    which are between x- and cap-height, and have half-descenders and full-ascenders.
    Again, these numerals look right in context. (The typeface in question does contain
    Proportional and Tabular Oldstyle, Lining, and x-height numerals too, along with
    numerators, denominators, and scientific inferiors. 10 number sets in total, but
    I really only had to design half of them, and can re-use the other half.)\r\n\r\nI
    think that historical precedent can dictate the default as well: Garaldes should
    have Proportional Oldstyle, and modernist sanses should have Tabular Lining. These
    just look right, half of which is probably due to their looking \"unsurprising\"."

  body: "The default should be tabular lining.\r\n\r\nTabular, because proportional
    figures really screw up a tab setting, while tabular are OK (though not ideal)
    in a text setting -- and both situations are likely to occur for users who are
    not aware of the options.\r\n\r\nLining, for the same reason: old style figures
    are just too quaint for most tabular settings, especially when leading is tight.
    \r\n\r\nTabular settings are not confined to financial or mathematical pages,
    but occur in many commercial uses, such as price lists and phone numbers in business
    stationery and contact information.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree with chester
    over what looks \"right\", and recognize that sophisticated typographers (at a
    design studio, say) may prefer OSF in a pre-1800 type genre, the problem is that
    the typographer is often not the end user, as when a type is specified for a corporate
    identity and third parties such as sales promotion companies, or the client's
    in-house art department, assume that responsibility. They are less likely to be
    typographically astute enough to change proportional to lining when required,
    and may well be using software that doesn't even give them the option."

    to the others. \r\n\r\nI can't think of the typefaces, but occasionally I am annoyed
    by the default. However, with OT I see no reason why I should be annoyed. As long
    as I'm given a choice. -- Or is that asking too much?"
