  Maybe \"Dobra\", by DSType? I wonder.\r\n\r\nI was doing a research on Fontshop.com,
  it's not Absara, because the \"M\" in Absara \"touches\" the baseline. In this case,
  the \"M\" is \"suspended\" and the \"O\" is very \"oval\"-like. Notice also how
  the \"R\" \"leg\" goes a little beyond it's own space...(I don't know exactly how
  this is called in typography, sorry!)\r\n\r\nGeogrotesque? I don't know...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Um_Enigma_Chamado_Brasil_capa_de_livro_12863_gg_4525.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks

    is one thing to be, especially as a student, inspired by a successful contemporary
    type design. It is quite another to release the outcome as a half-baked open source
    font family for free.\r\n\r\nIt is a mystery to me what \u2018hand-selecting\u2019
    and \u2018quality\u2019 means to the makers of Fontsquirrel. Have you looked under
    the hood of Titillium?"

  body: "Well, where to start?\r\nWhat is the reasoning behind 5 of the 7 weights
    being numbered (250, 400, 600, 800, 999), and 2 named \u2018Text Bold\u2019 (style:
    \u2018Regular\u2019) and \u2018Title Thin\u2019 (style: \u2018Thin\u2019)? Especially
    intriguing: why is the \u2018Text Bold\u2019 of the same light weight as the \u2018Title
    Thin\u2019 (lighter than \u2018250\u2019)?\r\n\r\nKeeping the widths of all characters
    consistent over 5 weights hardly ever works out.\r\n\r\nTitillium might be a style
    that doesn\u2019t need extensive kerning \u2013\_but zero kerning pairs is a bit
    meager.\r\n\r\nHave you tried typing an eszett (\xDF) or guillemets (\xBB\xAB)?
    Don\u2019t need those? Okay, try Dollar ($) or section mark (\xA7). Looks okay
    in the Thin? Try switching to a bolder weight.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s an image, showing
    some glyphs from the 400 weight.\r\nThere are at least 3 different weights in
    one font, sometimes 2 of them combined in 1 glyph.\r\nWhat about that overlap
    in the \xD0?\r\nWhat\u2019s going on with the g? 3 alternates, all in 1 slot?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/titillum_3773.png]\r\n\r\nI
    understand that this is a collaborative students\u2019 project. And as an Open
    Source font, it\u2019s kinda permanent beta.\r\nWhat the participants (I assume
    they haven\u2019t been exposed to type design before) have accomplished is very
    respectable, and could serve as a good base.\r\nI also understand that the <a
    href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/28458\">Square Sans</a> is just a very popular
    genre, and there\u2019s room enough next to Klavika et al.\r\n\r\nMy object of
    disapproval is not so much them or their font, but rather Fontsquirrel labeling
    this work-in-progress as \u201Conly the best commercial-use free fonts\u201D.
    Titillium is not on a par with Aller or Museo. I wouldn\u2019t want to work with
    this tool."

  body: "About Titillium.\r\nI just updated this year's exams on original website.
    \r\nThe font now is more complete than last semester (there have been 2 intermediate
    upgrades since font squirrel's version):\r\nhttp://www.campivisivi.net/titillium/?page_id=2\r\nnow
    is far more complete, but it's obviously not a professional work.\r\nIn this course
    students make their first experience with type design (and most of them with typography
    in general) and they are not exactly students of graphic design: they come from
    interaction design, video, motion graphics or illustration.\r\nEvery year a new
    group of pure beginners works 30-40 hours on Titillium during 3-4 months, after
    a brief introduction to type design and some hours of handmade exercises. \r\nThis
    is just the 3rd year we are working on Titillium (the project started in 2008,
    8-10 students per year).\r\nThe project started from an exercise of a student
    (a square-sans \"dotted\" typeface). We chose to work on this specific \"square
    sans\" because it was, in our opinion, the easiest starting point for neophyte
    among all the other options presented by students.\r\n\r\nThis explains the lack
    of kernings, the simplistic naming and the other inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nWe decided
    to release Titillium under Sil license because:\r\n1) we'd like to give to the
    students (not just to ours) the possibility to use and modify a font instead of
    using illegally commercial fonts (under this point of view probably it make sense
    even to work on a sort of \"paradigmatic\" square shape);\r\n2) in order to make
    an experiment of collective design process, defining just simple basic rules (maybe
    too much strong?). This is the main task of the course, even more important than
    speaking of typography (students doesn't aim at being typographers);\r\n3) we'd
    like that everybody who wants could use, modify, republish his version of the
    font. \r\nIn my opinion it makes sense to share what you do, when it is possible.
    Users will help you to fix problems or will discuss with you about the sense of
    what you are doing.\r\n\r\nWe are very pleased that so many people liked and used
    Titillium and that it was \"hand-selected\" by Fontsquirrel. Maybe this typeface
    has some qualities even if it is a permanent work in progress, but we never claimed
    that this is a professional font or a particularly original one. \r\n"

  body: 'I prefer Titillium over Klavika, Neo, etc. for many reasons: it is free,
    I can modify it if I need to, it has more weights, it is softer, conceptually
    more consequent, has a nice g and it feels fresh and experimental. I use it for
    one client in particular: a foundation for experimental music. We are not interested
    in "pro" features, HZ optical kerning in InDesign works fine, and the fact that
    the Titillium is still in a positive evolution is a big plus for us.'
