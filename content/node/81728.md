  you can help the WNY Book Arts Center purchase a rare treasure trove of Woodtype
  via Kickstart.  http://kck.st/hbVYiJ\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if someone listed this
  already, but a search of the site comes up empty. Tiffany Wardle de Sousa posted
  it on her facebook page and I've reposted it around.  They're up a few hundred from
  the other day, so something's working. \r\n\r\nFrom the posting at Kickstart:\r\n\r\nThe
  WNY Book Arts Center has grown from a rough idea into one of the most active letterpress
  printing and book arts centers in the country in a very short time. It has all been
  done through massive volunteer efforts and without ANY public funding. All income
  has been self-generated, but as we all know these are tough times. WNYBAC has an
  opportunity to acquire a collection of antique woodtype and needs your help. Woodtype
  has become a scarce commodity for printers due to years of neglect (with tales of
  firewood kindling and collage sculpture) and now with eBay sellers cashing in one
  letter at a time, full sets of woodtype have become very scarce.\r\n\r\nA collection
  of woodtype from a local printer has come to the attention of WNYBAC and we are
  torn up that we cannot muster the funds to buy it up. If we do not, the seller has
  decided to sell on eBay. We are looking to secure the funds to purchase this collection
  for use in the WNYBAC printshop.  It has been dormant for more than 50 years, and
  we'd like not only to make it available to the local printing community, but also
  to woodtype aficionados by distributing specimen sheets of the fonts that haven't
  been printed in decades.\r\n\r\nIt is very simple, we need $4,000. With this money
  we can buy the collection, clean and preserve it, and integrate it into our community
  printshop. The rewards are specimens of the type that we would acquire. We have
  already printed several specimens of our existing woodtype fonts which can be seen
  in the preview video. Additional specimens will be printed with the newly acquired
  fonts. Any funds raised beyond the project goal will be put into supplies and equipment
  for the WNYBAC printshop.\r\n\r\nIt's a reciprocal proposition.  Help us get wood
  (type) and we'll give you wood (prints).\r\n\r\nWe would continue this series as
  11 x 17 broadsheets. Each specimen will be arranged and printed in a signed and
  numbered edition of 100 copies.\r\n\r\nEven if you're from out of town, we think
  this is a worthy endeavor, because we love visitors.  Imagine helping us rescue
  this wood type, then being able to come visit it and possibly use it!  WNYBAC is
  a member based organization but we bring groups of students (from grade school to
  college level) who use our facilities to learn in a hands-on setting and take home
  the work they produce.\r\n\r\nWe welcome everyone to our printshop in downtown Buffalo,
  NY. We are open Wed-Sat 12-6.  Share this with anyone who you think might be interested,
  from graphic designers to printers, and collectors to aesthetes.\r\n "
