  sample was xeroxed out of an old type book by a client of mine who wants to use
  it for a project. Any help would be appreciated! <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>D666<img

  body: Thanks for your help you guys!  <BR> <BR>That Blackletter resource [<a href="http://www.romana-hamburg.de/fraktur1.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.romana-hamburg.de/fraktur1.htm</a>] is amazing - is
    it actually a type foundry? Any other unique BlackLetter links I should know about?

  body: Hi Stephen, hi Yves, hi all, <BR>It&#39;s an honour to be welcomed by such
    harmonious flourish of trumpets. <BR>The Druk story is kinda off-topic here, but
    let&#39;s say that all parties decided that it was time for something new, and
    one party &#40;guess who&#41; that it was time for something less expensive.  I&#39;m
    now thinking about an English-language anthology of 4 years of Druk. I may have
    a publisher for it, I only need a volunteer with impeccable English to edit the
    text.... <BR> <BR>Any luck with the Fleischmann, Dave?
