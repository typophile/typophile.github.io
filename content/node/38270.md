    this face contents several typefaces and curves in one face; a strange on, I don't

    but I agree with Stephen -- this one is really intriguing. Of course it's not
    easy to judge it properly without seeing it up close and in different settings."

  body: It's a specific corporate font made by [[http://www.kontrapunkt.dk/|Kontrapunkt]],
    as part of their revamp of [[http://superbrugsen.dk/|SuperBrugsen's]] identity.
    It comes in 3 weights; light, medium and bold, and is also used in the new logo
    and most of their other material. Oh, and as far as I know it's simply referred
    to as "SuperBrugsen Font".

  body: "eh, that's just plain wrong.. I don't know who really did it, but Kontrapunkt
    certainly has nothing to do with either the typeface or the rest of the new identity.
    \r\nNext time, check your sources a little better and save the pseudo-knowledge
    (\"It comes in 3 weights; light, medium and bold [...] simply referred to as 'SuperBrugsen
    Font'\"), Daniel."

    it, and was told it was Kontrapunkt - and I simply assumed that was correct -
    sorry about the mix-up, if the credit goes to e-Types... \r\n\r\n- Class, woah,

    I just joined here specifically to try to give a little bit of insight, since
    I've been working on most of the stuff listed above (website, tvc, some of the
    print...), and I just think it's a bit weird to go off on somebody trying to help
    out a little bit... Guess that's the good old internets for you. - Meh, maybe
    it's just to monday-ish :)"
