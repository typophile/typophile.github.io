  body: "I can't find it either [I have searched a database of 200.000 fonts].\r\nI
    can't tell for sure if it's modified or not, but if you take a closer look at
    the serifs of /H they are asymmetrical in a very peculiar way... \r\nThis could
    be the result of a bad font, a bad rendering, a raster magnification or an ugly
    font modification.. I don't know...\r\n\r\nIf you use Aachen Medium, expand it
    to at least 160%-170% and cut-off the serifs of /T I think will get close enough.
    \r\nGive it a try ;)"

  body: I agree, Fivos. Those curves under the crossbar of the T look like <em>very</em>
    badly done modifications and - as such - Aachen seems like the best starting point.
