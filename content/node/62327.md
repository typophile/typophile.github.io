body: Greetings. Soundesign was a manufacturer of stereo equipment (most notably,
  8-track players) in the 1970s and early 80s. While the brand lives on in some form
  today, it's missing the groovy 1970s logo (see photo, attached). It's somewhat similar
  to the RCA logo and I'm sure I've seen this as a commercial typeface; any idea what
  it is?

  body: I would be surprised if it wasn't custom. I'm pretty sure I've ever seen this
    style in any type catalog.
