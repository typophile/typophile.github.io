  credits of the film Billion Dollar Brain, credits by Maurice Binder.\r\n\r\nIt reminds
  me of Amelia, also from 1967. Is there a common ancestor to these fonts?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/billion-dollar-brain/|more

    you think there's too many typefaces in the world, then you can't find one that
    matches... :)"

  body: "For something asymmetric like this its probably easier to edit an existing
    font. \r\nThis lettering was made in quick order using FF Trademarker Light https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-trademarker/\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BDBrain_4359.jpg]\r\nHow
    to: \r\nCondense to 80%\r\nThicken stroke on rhs by reducing width of counter.\r\nTo
    make _R_ use _B_ and cut out the bottom.\r\nTo make _A_ thicken the stoke on both
    the counter side and the outside.\r\nTo make _N_ use the wide stoke from _A_ and
    stretch it a little wider.\r\nIf you want to make a closer match, edit as much
    as you want.\r\nDon"
