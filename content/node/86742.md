  I realise it's most likely that it's a heavily tweaked or entirely custom face,

  body: "It's most certainly custom lettering. I've always considered that style 'streamline'
    given the era it references, but I now realize that's actually the name of a specific
    typeface (which is in the ballpark):\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/streamline/\r\n\r\nSo,
    I'll add to the question for the rest of the typophilers: Does this particular
    style (mechanical script faces with heavy, emphasized baselines indicative of
    product nameplates from the streamline/deco period) have a name? "
