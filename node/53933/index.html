If none exists I think this would be a great project, and would produce something worthy of hanging on the office wall.</div>

When I was in high school, long before I dreamed that I would work for much of my adult life as a graphic designer, I bought this big box of "Foot-High Letters" that I found in a museum gift shop. It was a 1960s Dover reprint of a 1940 publication, probably originally intended for use in art classrooms. 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letters4_4765.JPG]
They're really meant to show the distinguishing characteristics of type families rather than the history of type design, but they still make handsome conversation pieces.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letters1_5321.JPG]
A quick Google search turned up few UK dealers who list this set for the equivalent of US $10 or less.

Quincunx, nice samples, and I'd love to see that comparative poster... I like Florian's Family Tree of Type as well - very ornate (can you send me a high res copy or tell me where you found it?)

Now there's a thing... when you end an parenthesised sentence with a question mark, do you then need to close the parent sentence with a period?

Altaira, thanks, that poster looks like a close match to what I'm after... I looked at the webpage, but not being multi-lingual, I couldn't make out the accompanying text. I'll have a go at putting it through the google translator, but it'll probably come out like some drunken haiku. 

Thanks... I'd buy one off the webpage, but I don't even know if that Paypal button is for the full sized poster?

		<div class="commentbody">Steve, here's a quick translation of the text on that web site. Sorry if it sounds garbled – my brain's like 99% full of my font right now :-)

<em>An educational poster for real connoisseurs of the Black Art. For the first time, this overview shows all German type foundries, as well as more than 200 takeovers and transfers, as a logical, genealogical tree. Connecting lines highlight individual developments. The resulting view clearly outlines the rise and bloom of the Black Art, as well as its abrupt termination by the rise of phototype. 
Gutenberg was the first European to print with movable type. His idea quickly found enthusiastic followers, who continued to spread type casting throughout Germany and Europe. This new technology brought forth numerous new typefaces, the most important of which are displayed on the poster.</em>

I can recommend Christian's posters, though I haven't seen this one; I have his 2009 calendar poster and it's beautifully laid out and printed. I'm pretty sure he speaks English, so you could also email him directly with any further questions (there's an email link on the "Impressum" page).</div>

I'm at the office right now, but as I recall, Latin capitals are near the bottom, and Futura and Bodoni are at the top. :)

I should be able to upload a photo tomorrow.

Huh. That PDF in turn cites the URL for an article I wrote as its source (though it has a number of added milestones and dates, I think).

		<div class="commentbody">Guys (and gals) thank you so much for all of the info... The webpage timeline, and that PDF are absolutely perfect for me to use as a learning/memory aid. 

One of my greatest ambitions (and the reason for my ongoing research) is to eventually create a general purpose typeface that will go some way to bringing back the notion of the serif into contemporary typography... I love what Erik Spiekermann et al have done with Meta Serif... I am convinced it's the way things will go, certainly in corporate usage (anyone think it will catch on in other areas?)

Part of my research turned up an amazing fact, when I discovered I live barely 2 miles from Baskerville's birthplace... I meantioned this to a friend recently who laughed at my wanting to visit the place and wondered if I might be wanting to become a great typographer through osmosis. I know it's not so easy!
