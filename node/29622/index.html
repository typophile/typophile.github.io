I have not been able to find any yet, although it *seems* do-able. If it does not yet exist, I would like to try and tackle that, or suggest that the experienced coders look into it. It could, for example, become a plug-in module to the JQuery [www.jquery.com] JavaScript library.

I'm hoping we can get a list started. What sort of typographic conventions are we  neglecting because they are not easily typeset on the web?</div>

CSS:

p {
text-indent: 4em;
}

Also, the best way to approach web typography is to let go of the 'finer points' of control that you would normally have on paper. 

"The use of real Small Caps is one that comes to my mind"

Again, CSS:

yourTag {
font-variant: small-caps
}

"Given the scrolling nature of the Web I would imagine that space between paragraphs is preferable to indented paragraphs for most forms of text setting."

I agree (though other's may not, of course). The web is often more of a 'pan and scan' medium where people are looking for excerpts vs. sitting down and reading an article from start to finish. Having the visual breaks between paragraphs makes that task a bit easier.

Whatever you do, don't indent AND have spaces between paragraphs. Way too redundant for my tastes. ;o)

That and it comes from lousy hardware and what people are used to after 3+ decades of computer use.

Not to mention print tradition well before that...

I can't think of any real benefits to horizontal scrolling on a web page off the top of my head for anything even partially text based. What did you have in mind?

The problem is that you are assuming. Again, you can't assume anything about my web browser based on my screen (without standing here next to me). 

It sounds like you have some preference to horizontal scrolling, which is fine and all, but most usability testing seems to indicate that people prefer vertical scrolling when it comes to web pages. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">There might be something to the horizontal scrolling argument. Maybe the resistance  to (discomfort with)  scrolling this way has to do with the position of the  scrollbar? It could well have to do with right handedness and the vertical scroll conveniently placed to the right of the content. With a horizontal scrollbar reaching over way to the left to advance to the next column just does not <em>feel right</em>. Do the usability studies have any insights into why people prefer vertical / dislike horizontal scrolling?

Just a speculation, but as people get used to the trackpad and mouse wheel scrolling (I have the Apple's Mighty Mouse - unidirectional ball in mind), our natural reading habits may resurface and "turn the web on its side."

We can -and need to- assume all kinds of things to be able to function. Like when we're driving, we need to assume that the car next to us will NOT abruptly start driving across the lanes. But more to the point: we can <cite>confidently</cite> assume various things about the <cite>typical</cite> web browser. Like you know the DVD message that says "This movie has been modified to fit your screen"? I hate that, because they don't know what my screen is. But if they said "modified to fit the typical screen" then I wouldn't complain.

Compared to horizontal, or compared to none?
What are the exact details of this testing?
Many tests suck.

I have come across a freeware application for OS X which lays out copied text into columns. No vertical scrolling - strictly horizontal.
