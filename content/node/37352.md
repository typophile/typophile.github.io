  printed on a balloon that's \r\nblown up? I did it effectively the other day and
  can't \r\nrecreate it. The letterforms are being more distorted\r\nthat would be
  in reality. \r\n\r\nThank you!"

    (vertical), then \r\nexpand the type to release the effect and then went back
    to Bulge horizontal.\r\n\r\nSee what happens though? The letters get sort of squared
    off and lopsided.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/balloontype_5265.png]\r\n\r\nI
    would expect to do some tweaking of the letterforms. It just seems like \r\nthere's
    an effect with less distortion."

    from that.. there's also the Bloat Tool, in the toolbar. It's tucked under the
    Warp Tool icon. "

  body: Or make the letters a little smaller in the balloon, which should decrease
    the effect.

  body: "I would map the characters onto a 3d model in wireframe Illustrator CS or
    Dimensions, simple enough with a regular shape like a balloon, copy the characters
    into a new layer \u2013 still requires adjustment though.\r\nAnother thing you
    might try is to create a rectangle to represent the face of the balloon, place
    your characters within it and envelope distort both elements (have the balloon
    shape visible in the background to guide you), this should reduce the effect of
    having/not having ascenders and descenders.\r\n\r\nTim"

    tried every tool, I figured I would throw out \r\nthe question!"
