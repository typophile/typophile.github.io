body: hi! does anyone know of any online examples of style guides for logos? I need
  to do quite a comprehensive one for a client. <BR>I&#39;m also wondering about the
  legalities of using a designer font in a logo, does the client also need to own
  the font?

  body: '&#62;I&#39;m also wondering about the legalities of using a designer font

    almost never use an existing typeface for a piece of display type, such as a trademark.
    the client is paying you to produce a piece of unique and ownable type, not trade
    gothic. it&#39;s harder for a company to really own something that 5000 other
    companies own as well.'

  body: Agreed for the most part. But, sometimes is about how you use the type that
    counts. Hand- or computer-lettering is a diminishing skill. Do they even teach
    it at colleges any more? A lot of graphic designers don&#39;t have the eye or
    the skills for drawing new letterforms. I think basic calligraphy and lettering
    skills should still be taught at design schools. Graphic designers simply take
    ready-made type for granted these days with the computer.

  body: i agree one hundred percent keith and yes some schools do still teach hand
    lettering. it was a mandatory part of the curriculum at &#40;dare i say it&#41;
    art center. it also happens to be the course i teach up here.

  body: That&#39;s great, Jay. How do you teach it? Do you start with a broad-edge
    pen? What books do you use? My guess is you use Doyald Young&#39;s books. Do you
    think calligraphy is important to the understanding of letterforms? Do you always
    start with pencil and paper then digitize with beziers? Do you use historical
    sources? I&#39;m interested to know as much as possible, as I&#39;m really eager
    to incorporate it into my type course in September.

  body: I have to add my 2 cents on this one.  <BR>I agree that it isn&#39;t ideal
    if designing a very type based logo to just choose a font. I wish I had the ability
    &#40;and time&#41; to design type for clients. and then there is the issue of
    a client having enough money to have a custom designed font! <BR>Instead I focus
    mostly on symbols which leads to font choices - not a quick decision by any means...
    <BR> <BR>As a graphic designer not a type designer - I feel my role is to look
    through the foundaries and pick the most appropriate font - and to make it quite
    unlike 5000 other logos that may use that font? which if true, means I probably
    would not have chosen it... <BR>I do wish I could do it all...

  body: natalija, there was a day when the only efficient way a graphic designer could
    produce trademark designs was to hand draw them. this was an important skill that
    designers needed to have. i don&#39;t feel it is impossible to be a designer and
    produce unique display types. i can attest to this in my class as well. each semester
    i have a random grouping of lower term students who have little or no experience
    with this stuff. i am always amazed that when shown a few simple procedures their
    world of typography and their skill in seeing type harmony blossom. through their
    diligent work i have seen some amazing success stories.

  body: keith, that&#39;s great that you are looking into teaching hand lettering.
    i think it&#39;s an important element to a designers career. it has been a subject
    that i devote a full term of study to. i can&#39;t imagine trying to fit it into
    a class as a single small project. i&#39;ve noticed that students don&#39;t fully
    get most of the major principles until about there third project. i&#39;ll give
    you an ultra quick run down of how i teach the subject. <BR> <BR>1-i present the
    major differences between display types and text types. i then lay out the playing
    field, getting into typeface classifications and text types. my hope is to let
    them see that by drawing display types they are only working on a small section
    of the subject of type. each project runs for about three class periods. each
    class is a crit. <BR>2-we start breaking right into it. no time to waste the term
    is fairly short the class is usually full and the subject is large. i give them
    there first assignment which is to do a set of initials. i start small. <BR>3-next
    assignment is to letter a proper name. this gives them more letterforms they need
    to deal with. <BR>4-last project is to do a made up name of there choosing. this
    is meant to let them have fun and pursue their own interests. this project also
    runs parallel with a business papers project utilizing one of the marks they done
    during the class. <BR> <BR>all assignments are done on tracing paper at larger
    size. they do 15-20 comps each time until they narrow in on something successful.
    finals are either rendered on velum with ink or can be moved on to the computer
    if their skills are competent enough. it&#39;s hard but i have little time to
    help students by teaching a class on illustrator as well. <BR> <BR>i don&#39;t
    introduce students to the art of calligraphy or the use of broad nib pens unless
    their specific project requires it. i love this area of study but feel that one
    would have to devote a whole term at least to it. <BR> <BR>as far as books are
    concerned, i use elements from both &#34;trademarks of excellence&#34; and &#34;fonts
    and logos&#34;. doyald young was an instructor of mine back in school and my class
    follows his teachings on many levels.

    essential. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: you are correct. they are both covered and fall into similar categories as
    far as i&#39;m concerned. display type with a heavy emphasis on hand lettering.
