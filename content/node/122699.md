  and got intrigued by the Ikarus system he used, looks like OS 8 or such.\r\n\r\nI
  cast on Ludlow, have a decent collection, but also have the equipment to cut mats
  and have cut mats for Ludlow to suit my needs.\r\n\r\nAnybody has an idea if a system
  is out there?\r\n\r\nLudwig\r\n\r\nwww.krauseintaglio.com"

  body: "You're right about OS 8. I had a demo of Ikarus-M around that time but had
    quite a few problems with it so abandoned it. I don't think the software is available
    any longer since URW++ sells the DTL FontMaster software these days.\r\n\r\nDutch
    Type Library's FontMaster is based on Ikarus and is available for modern operating
    systems. They have a free light version if you want to try it out. It runs on
    the Mac under Wine.\r\nhttp://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/"
