  like to design the spreads as independent from the computer as I can get. As a student
  educated solely on the computer I am excited to explore these practices.\r\n\r\nSo
  I need to create a body of text in 9pt Adobe Caslon regular. I have looked into
  Chartpak and Letraset and have yet to find my exact needs.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest
  a resource or a practice to achieve my desired result? I am also considering phototypesetting,
  but don't know much about it.\r\n\r\nAny information would be helpful!\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

  body: "Well, Adobe Caslon is of course an Adobe version of Caslon, and inherently
    digital.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go truly old-school, then you want hand-set metal
    type, and you should set it yourself. If you tell folks where you are based, perhaps
    somebody can suggest a school or something where you could get access to metal
    type.\r\n\r\nIf (as your profile suggests) you are based in Rochester, NY, then
    of course you could see if RIT has any classes or workshops that would give you
    access to one of the old-fashioned letterpresses they have. There is a lovely
    Washington 1830 cast-iron handpress in the Cary Graphic Arts Collection....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "maybe you should search after a letterpress or try to carv the letters by
    yourself into wood. if you really want to use caslon you could print your text
    mirrored via a laserprinter and then you could transfer the print on another surface
    by grinding some \tnitro-cellulose combination thinner on it. "

  body: 'FYI: Dry transfer letters were never used for setting body text. At least
    by anyone sane. I used dry transfers mostly during the pre-digital, photoype period,
    after metal was obsolete. You can still set metal type (or get someone else to),
    but I don''t imagine anyone has an old Linofilm or Compugraphic Editwriter in
    their basement setting cold type old-school. IBM Composer, maybe. I don''t think
    anything is as dead as typesetting technology between the metal and digital eras.'

    replicate the experience by faxing her text to someone, with her specs written
    out on it, and they could set it in Adobe Caslon on their Mac, output it to some
    really hard and smooth paper (as close to repro as possible), and mail it back
    to her for pasting up.\r\n\r\nAnd then, she can call them up at 11:00 at night
    and dictate corrections over the phone ;-)"
