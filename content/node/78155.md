  today, here's an excerpt:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nTexts in easy-to-read typefaces
  make it harder to recall information than if it is presented in less legible formats,
  research suggests\r\n\r\nA study by Princeton University found that a significant
  number of those tested could recall more information when it was presented in unusual
  typefaces rarely used in textbooks. \r\n\r\nThe research suggests that introducing
  'disfluency' - by making information superficially harder to understand - deepens
  the process of learning and encourages better retention.\r\n\r\nThe psychologists
  said information which has to be actively generated rather than 'passively acquired'
  from simple text is remembered longer and more accurately.\r\n\r\nThe study raises
  questions over how much fonts like Times New Roman and Arial, which are used in
  the majority of academic books, help readers revise for tests.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nHe
  said the study showed the whole history of typography was had missed the point when
  it comes to learning.\r\n\r\nMr Lehrer said: 'It has been a movement towards easy
  to read fonts. We assume that anything which makes it easier to see the content
  is a good thing.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nJonah Lehrer's take on it is [[http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/the-benefit-of-ugly-fonts|here]]\r\n\r\nThe
  study, Fortune favors the <strong>Bold</strong> <em>(and the Italicized)</em>: Effects
  of disfluency\r\non educational outcomes can be read [[http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Diemand-Yauman_Oppenheimer_2010.pdf|here]].\r\n\r\nThoughts
  anyone? Did Emigre have exactly the right idea then after all, and are the rest
  of us <em>really</em> missing the point? \r\n\r\nPerhaps there are holes and flaws
  in this study. One group's retention rate was tested with material set in Monotype
  Corsiva, Comic Sans Italicized and Haettenshweiler whilst the group being compared
  against in the study were reading material set mostly in Helvetica and Arial (legible?),
  could it just mean reading material in profusely overused typefaces bores the reader
  easier and allows for laziness."

    is just flawed. That being said, I do see how such an effect is possible. When
    I needed to retain information for an exam, I would often read the text up-side-down,
    which slowed my reading and definitely helped me remember much better."

    instead of actual text, so that as far as the article metadata is concerned, its
    title is \"Fortune favors the &nbsp;(): Effects of disfluency on educational outcomes\"\r\n\r\nLOL..."

    typeface might have something to do with it? Could it be that even if they begin
    to set all educational material in Comic Sans Italic, eventually that'll become
    the same over and over and suddenly Helvetica is the one that stick in readers
    minds longer."

    it amounts to tying a new string around your finger for every new thing you want
    or need to remember. Pretty soon, it is a method that is worse than useless. \r\n\r\nNext

    up to using learning-friendly Shinntype fonts such as <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/78053\">Fontesque</a>,
    which is available in an optically scaled version suitable for lengthy texts.\r\n\r\nI
    wonder what typeface this research paper was set in, Papyrus or Comic Sans?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This sounds like a piece of bad research, if accurately reported, as the
    report doesn't mention any control for time. Of course, if you have to spend ten
    minutes deciphering a paragraph, reading it slowly and repeatedly, you are more
    likely to remember it. \r\n\r\nThe idea of high readability, at least for non-fiction,
    is that you can read quickly for meaning, and remember what *you* find valuable,
    not what is forced upon you by repetition from having to puzzle it out.  \r\n\r\nAlso
    for extended text if it is really difficult to read, you are not likely to read
    it at all. "

  body: "@oneweioranother \r\nIf you are thinking I'm kidding about not finding Helvetica
    a readable text face- having to read a whole textbook set in Helvetica really
    drove me nuts. I was continually having to re-read paragraphs because my brain
    insisted on seeing letters instead of words. The font is just too regular for
    extended text. I know a lot of designers disagree, but I really don't like to
    see more than one paragraph at a time set in Helvetica. Not that I'm against all
    sans settings. Just not Helvetica (and really not Univers).\r\n\r\n(I'm also not
    kidding about turning my text books upside down.)"
