    don't know why FontExplorer sizes them so differently in the viewer. \r\n\r\nIn
    any case, clearly modified are the a and the r, and the widths are noticably extended
    in the UC, which is wider than the widest available Myriad version, and the weight
    is lighter than the lightest available version also.\r\n\r\nI like!"

    Myriad MM to get this weight and width. Some details of the design were changed
    of course.  "

    Tekton MM, which came with an old Adobe package, which isn't a font I have the
    greatest desire to make instances of :)\r\n\r\nI dunno, but I think the change
    to the a is a cool one. Just that minor adjustment makes the whole thing seem
    friendlier.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Without having examined the font closely, my guess is that this version of
    Myriad is intended to come close to matching the ANSI CAD lettering standard.
    A few years ago, we were hired to make a stricter implementation of the ANSI standard
    for a CAD software company (and also fonts for the weirder ISO standard), it it
    looked not unlike this version of Myriad.

  body: "Here, top, is the implementation we made of the ANSI standard lettering for
    CAD. The Myriad CAD letters are pretty close to this, except for that lowercase
    <em>a.</em> We made this font in 2000, so perhaps the standard has changed since
    then. Below, is the weird ISO standard lettering.\r\n\r\nWe made these fonts for
    a CAD software company called Microcadam. A few days after we delivered the fonts,
    the company was bought by IBM, and the Helix design program for which the fonts
    were intended was removed from the market. I've no idea what happened to the fonts,
    but presumably IBM owns them, whether they realise it or not.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cad_4975.gif]"
