body: "Hi, can anyone ID this sans-serif? Also, are there any similar typefaces around.
  I'm having a hard time trying to find typos of the same kind. Maybe it's because
  I can't just find a good clasification name for this. I know its a modern or contemporary
  sans-serif. But I just can't get it. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

  body: "This type is very familiar to Londoners like myself. It is Edward Johnston's
    Transport Alphabet digitized by Banks & Miles for London Transport (1988) and
    then probably snapped up by ITC. The design was commissioned by Frank Pick who
    was the commercial manager of the London Electric Railway Company in 1916 \u2014
    exactly one hundred years after the first showing of a sans serif type by the
    London founder William Caslon IV. Johnston's alphabet is the first sans (or 'gothic'
    as the Americans say) that owes a design debt to humanistic script and roman epigraphic
    capitals. The model was greatly improved by Johnston's friend and collaborator
    Eric Gill with his eponymous Gill sans which was produced by the English Monotype
    company in 1927.  "
