body: "In my ongoing quest to understand font software EULAs, I have a new question:\r\n\r\n<strong>Why
  do some font designers or foundries prohibit or require an additional license fee
  to use a font for a logo?</strong>\r\n\r\nIn understand wanting a different kind
  of fee for adding the actual software (or some subset thereof) to a product that
  will be sold, be it interactive (a design program) or even static (a set of alphabetic
  rubber stamps). I don't understand the reason for additional fees when it comes
  to (relatively) static use such as logos, where the software never leaves the designer's
  office.\r\n\r\nYour thoughts?"

  body: "Because logos are special. They go on every single thing a client does. You
    don\u2019t get a great logo by using cheap type.\r\n\r\nAnd a LOT of designers
    are letting the font designer do most of the work in creating a wordmark. In some
    agencies a workmark design is 90% done after a name is dumped into a stock document
    with find/replace. If your client wants a great logo, they need to pay for great
    lettering. If you can\u2019t draw great letters, and you\u2019re not willing to
    hire someone who can, you SHOULD have to pay extra for great letters. If you think
    that you\u2019re so good you should not have to pay extra to use fonts in logos,
    then you need to draw your own letters."

    is for sale at TypeTrust for $20. Which of the following uses would require me
    to obtain what the EULA defines as a commercial license and what would the additional
    license cost:\r\n\r\n<ul>\u2022 Use as title text on CD/DVD packaging or on a
    book cover\r\n\u2022 Use as title text on a poster or other collaterals for an
    event\r\n\u2022 Use as text in advertising in a magazine or newspaper\r\n\u2022
    Non-editable use on a website\r\n\u2022 Use as a wordmark logo\r\n\u2022 Use as
    a component of a logo that also includes other graphic elements</ul>\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the EULA specifies derivative work as font software and not anything involving
    the manipulation of vector letterforms created with use of the licensed font software.
    So am I correct in interpreting that the license allows me to create those vectors
    and then edit them to meet my client's aesthetic goals?"

    As for use in the logo, if it includes other elements you might not need to. Branding
    stuff gets negotiated with TypeTrust. I realize that isn\u2019t especially convenient,
    but it\u2019s not exactly killing an art director to send someone an email asking
    for clarification and pricing.\r\n\r\n<cite>So am I correct in interpreting that
    the license allows me to create those vectors and then edit them to meet my client\u2019s

    works is there to keep someone from changing the outlines around a little and
    reselling them."
