    an old ATF by Morris Fueller Benton, never digitized. Main difference is the /C.

  body: "Othello was originally cut by Gustav Schroeder for the Boston Type Foundry
    in 1884, and was revived by Morris Fuller Benton for ATF. Seymour Caprice used
    the original font as the basis for Bathysphere (2013) http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/kickingbirdfonts/bathysphere/\r\nThe
    exhibition lettering is similar to Othello but there are differences, ranging
    from the different _&_ to various details of the letters.\r\nDon"
