  on my iPod Nano. Now it plays <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6663282946491117841\">video</a>,
  <a  href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4032841114584378958\">Doom</a>,
  and the <a href=\"http://yorgle.cis.rit.edu/Hardware/nanomame/\">arcade games</a>
  I used to play as a kid. Why would I ever want to boot into Apple's standard iPod
  OS after getting a taste of this?\r\n\r\n"
