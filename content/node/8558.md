  body: 'This looks like a combination of Futura and Bayer&#39;s &#34;Universal&#34;.
    It often helps to look at the work of other designers, so take a gander at these:
    <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4606.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4606.html</A>
    <BR><A HREF="http://www.thefoundrystudio.co.uk/architypes.html" TARGET="_top">http://www.thefoundrystudio.co.uk/architypes.html</A>
    <BR> <BR>Aesthetically, I&#39;d say that the horizontal bar of &#34;f&#34; is
    a bit short &#40;so is the &#34;t&#34;&#39;s&#41;, the missing dot on the &#34;j&#34;
    is great, the &#34;k&#34;&#39;s upper arm should reach the x-height, the &#34;r&#34;&#39;s
    beak is too big, the &#34;s&#34; is too flat/wide, and the &#34;t&#34;, &#34;v&#34;
    &amp; &#34;z&#34; are nice. <BR> <BR>Technically, I&#39;d point out that you really
    need to taper the joints &#40;like between bowl and stem in the &#34;b&#34;&#41;
    at least a little, to avoid clotting. Like this: <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Character0062Style577.html"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.myfonts.com/Character0062Style577.html</A> <BR> <BR>But
    I see a bigger problem: this design is very mechanical &#40;your &#34;systematic
    thought&#34;&#41;, which might be OK except it doesn&#39;t convey the balance
    you say you&#39;re shooting for. You might consider putting some quirkiness in
    each character, either structurally &#40;like giving the &#34;z&#34; a descender
    - although the &#34;z&#34; actually has a lot of flair already&#41;, or in terms
    of finish &#40;like giving the terminals some calligraphic inflection&#41;. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>It is the Chalet type by House Industries. <BR> <BR>Or, you could have
    a look on the Lineto site. They are specialists, when it comes to geometric/constructed

    <BR> <BR>Jacques <BR> <BR>PS: making a Geometric type is good to learn the raw
    basics about type design. But making one that stands out against all the others
    is not easy.'
