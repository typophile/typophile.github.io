  body: Are you serious? No, it's definitely Le Griffe. <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/le-griffe-2/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D66%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DThe%2520Spiritual%2520Sword%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D28">Here
    is another cut</a> that also has the swash characters, including the cap S that
    I thought was modified.
