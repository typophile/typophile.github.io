  ?)\r\n\r\nI've got a friend whose designer will NOT set his text-based logo in mixed
  case, because the brand name starts with an \"i\". The designer is avoiding iPhone,
  iPad, &/c.\r\n\r\nSay it's \"iCyou\" or something like that. Or, was. And we're
  looking for a new setting of it.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking along the lines of: if there
  were a typeface with caps that act like (this) Berlin and (this) Papyrus does, in
  the sense of chewing up a lot of vertical space... and if said typeface had a Small
  Caps font... \r\n\r\nAnd yet the style of the face itself were nicely gothic sans,
  really quite no-nonsense. Meh, that part of the requirement is loose... but something
  clean, normal, clear, and sans. Friendly humanist would be OK, as would geometric.
  Just not silly.\r\n\r\nWhat do you know about this? Any typefaces for me to check
  out?"

    \r\n\r\nIf this is just for a logo, you could use practically any font that has
    small-caps, and manually lower the cap, no?"

  body: "ah yes, of course, Bernhard Fashion. I knew it was a knock-off; I had forgotten
    what it was a knock-off of.\r\n\r\nI thought of the whole small-caps thing, and
    it's certainly one viable approach. Guess I'd be looking for something with a
    small x-height, so that the capital is that much bigger than the small-capital.\r\n\r\nI've
    also come across fonts that are meant for monogramming. They're typically pretty
    specialized though.\r\n\r\nWondering if it isn't time to think of a different
    approach, such as just using a big flowery script for the \"C\" and keep the \"i\"
    and the \"you\" in a sedate sans. But that's on me.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: The technical term for this is "Titling". Thus, Times Titling is the version
    of Times Roman in which the capital letter fills the entire type slug, with no
    descender space left.

    Papyrus, and I would have seen that he was indeed not talking about titling faces,

    of the lowercase.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of a specific technical term for that,
    either."

  body: "@frode frank:\r\nAny digital fonts where the vertical metrics reflect this?\r\n\r\n@hrant:\r\nHow
    can there be more than one baseline?\r\n\r\nIn other words, to avoid confusing
    the innocent and na\xEFve, while it may be true that in such a font, all the capital
    letters descend below the baseline (for the small letters) by the same amount,
    thus establishing, in effect, a second baseline, for the purpose of the vertical
    metrics of the font, there can only be one position that is presented externally
    as the \"baseline\" for lining up characters of that font with other fonts.\r\n\r\nNow,
    in fact, I certainly <em>could</em> imagine a font format that does allow a second
    \"caps baseline\" to be associated with a font, and for there to be some complicated
    way to specify that \"oh, by the way, on this line where I'm mixing these two
    typefaces, I'm using all caps, so please align the letters by their caps baselines
    rather than their regular baselines\".\r\n\r\nAnd font metrics on Open Type are
    complicated enough that I wouldn't guarantee that we don't already <em>have</em>
    this feature.\r\n\r\nNow I've checked. We don't have it yet. However, as four
    lowercase letters make a baseline tag, all that has to be done is for someone
    to register a new baseline tag with Microsoft for this feature to <em>become</em>
    available."

  body: Well, the feature also has to be supported by software in a meaningful way.
    I don't think that is likely to happen, even if the relevant baseline tag(s) somehow
    got added to the specs.
