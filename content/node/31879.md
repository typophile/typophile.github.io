  characters in it's glyph set?\r\n\r\nMost (including all the Adobe Pro fonts I've
  looked at) only seem to have a, b, d, e, i, l, m, n, o, r, s, t.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Thanks Stefan, the request is for a friend, he didn't mention what style
    he wanted, but has since gotten back to me and said Sophisto looks perfect.\r\n\r\nHe
    needs it for embedding into a flash file (something to do with superscript not
    working natively in flash so he needs to use a font with superscript characters
    as part of the regular character set).\r\n\r\nI'm a bit ignorant when it comes
    to flash, and he's just asked me:\r\n\r\n\"<em>I need to test that it'll work
    with standard unicode in XML</em>\"\r\n\r\nI guess he's talking about the characters
    being part of the standard unicode set rather than 'extras' stuck in to spare
    unicode slots, so he should be alright I think...?"

  body: "He is more than likely going to need an OpenType font. Type 1 Postscript
    fonts had to \"lie\" about the character name for anything not in the standard
    encoding vector, and of course, used glyph names rather than Unicode. TrueType
    fonts are a bit different, but older ones may not have the correct Unicode for
    superscripts in the font. I mention this because when someone has characters in
    a separate \"expert\" font, they usually did so to get around the hard-wired encoding
    of Quark & older Macs & PCs.\r\n\r\nIf Sophisto is not now an OpenType font, I'm
    sure Mr. Hattenbach could make up a release to do what is needed.\r\n\r\nI believe
    the later issue of Palatino TT (Linotype) has all the lowercase alpha characters
    as superiors. I don't know of any font that has uppercase superiors. One could
    be made, of course.\r\n\r\nHope this helps"
