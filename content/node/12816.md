body: "Hi there. Since i'll soon be done with my BA hons Multimedia Arts in a few
  months, its time for me to start floating my resume around :D.\r\n\r\nBeing relativey
  new to typography, I'd love to have some of your opinions and suggestions on choosing
  fonts for a 2 page resume for a guy with a year's experience, type which is humble,
  non-submissive and truthful :).\r\n\r\nI really don't know much about typography
  so please pardon me if I do say something silly :o!\r\n\r\nAs of now I'm considering
  Helvetica Black, Shannon Book, Stone Sans, Myriad Pro, Cochin,   Stempel Garamond
  Roman and even Frutiger 55 Roman.\r\n\r\nIs it ok to have three fonts for the heading,
  sub-heading and the text or should I just stick to two?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to
  your suggestions and opinions :D.\r\n"

  body: "first, i would say NOT to have a resume be longer than two pages, for the
    design fields it can look a bit amateurish. also, picking a typeface isn't just
    about what you think looks nice, it is about what typeface best reflects you and
    your work. for example, what type of work do you want to do (corporate, fun, bands,
    movies, etc...)? i don't think anyone can tell you what typeface to use because
    its very personal.\r\n\r\nsecondly, although i'll go as far as saying i think
    its too much to use more than ONE typeface...some will say its okay to use more
    than that. i personally stick with one typeface and go with different weights
    and variations of the same face (ie, frutiger bold, frutiger roman, frutiger light,
    frutiger italic).\r\n\r\nreally there are no rules, just make it look right."

  body: "From my experience at work..I'm allowed to use 2 fonts in 3 sizes total per
    design. For a resume I would use the same font (different weights like suggested
    in previous post) I cant use two different serifs or san serifs in the same design.
    I mix a fancy original serif or script with a more plain serif like futura. I
    usually allow about 3-4 pts of size in between titles,subtitles and info like
    addresses on business cards or letterhead. For a resume you could use 10pt for
    info 12 for subtitles and 14 for your name. I would suggest exploring all the
    different weights in Frutigar..it's a great font with allot of options. My best
    advice is to keep it clean and simple and maybee put a nice logo at the top to
    represent yourself. Some people say a logo is even too much but I think it's helped
    me find work and gives it an original touch without having to spend too much time
    with fancy type. Good Luck\r\n\r\n***Shannon looks like a conservative comic text,
    its the most original looking to me out of all the ones you listed.****"

    Use something as bland as Times Roman. Keep it short and have your portfolio on-line
    with a link to it in the text. You have to think about the hiring process. Their
    is a screener to kill the first 100 applicants and narrow it down to a few. No
    design will affect these type of people."

    tbiddy\r\n Thanks for the advice. My resume fits in two pages now. If I were to
    reflect personal design, my resume would be too dekon and i really don't think
    that would work very well for me :). \r\n\r\n@fontobsession\r\n Thanks for the
    advice on font sizes. I've implemented those. With the sizes you suggested, my
    resume fits in two pages now. I'd personally love to have my logo but am at present
    ruling out on that. I hope 10 pt for info is readable. I'm going to print the
    file out right now and hope its legible enough to be read with ease :).\r\n\r\n@dan
    weaver\r\n Lol. True. I hope my resume passes through the meaner screener! I did
    keep him in mind while making my resume but can never be too sure... : o."

    predictable, good design is exactly what can tip the scales sometimes; and it
    certainly can't hurt! If they're looking for a bland person, and you don't mind
    acting like one, then by all means do use Times.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
