  FontLab Studio 5. I'm currently working on a typeface in Fontlab Studio that I'm
  hoping to release commercially. A tutor suggested that I should try to see if I
  can export the final OpenType/TrueType files in a 'locked' format, to prevent others
  from being able to easily open, edit and rerelease the typeface. However, as a beginner
  I don't yet know how to do this in FontLab Studio. \r\n\r\nAny instructions would
  be gratefully received,\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nJoe"

  body: Your tutor doesn't seem to know much about fonts. It's not possible to "lock"
    an OpenType or TrueType font the way you describe, no matter what font editor
    you use. If you make fonts, that's just something you have to accept.
