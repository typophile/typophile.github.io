  as a corporation, however... <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the deal with the really [really!]
  bad kerning of some diacritical characters &#40;both tilde vowels and macron vowels&#41;
  in Times New Roman in MS Word? <BR> <BR>I just didn&#39;t expect two industry standards
  &#40;Word and TNR&#41; to act so sporadically; I really thought every aspect of
  TNR would have been absolutely perfect. <BR> <BR>Si?

  body: Scott, I am afraid there are no kerning pairs for accented characters in TNR
    at all. I have just looked at its kerning table and it lists 877 pairs. If you
    take into account that the font contains over 1600 glyphs, you can imagine how
    far from perfect this font is. <BR>Si, I hope you need not see any screenshots
    as proof, don

  body: No. Word has kerning off by default, and if you turn it on you get the kerning
    built into the font. <BR> <BR>Or at least you&#39;re supposed to. For a few years,
    every other Mac version of Word broke kerning by reading the pairs backwards.
    So you&#39;d end up with kerning for aV but not Va, that kind of thing. I believe
    they have gotten over this one now. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    expect future versions to have a presumption in favour of kerning :?'
