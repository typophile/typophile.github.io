  body: "I used Blurb to make a book with my vacation photos and I was really happy
    with the [[http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/143191|final result]]. I didn't
    end up using their templates, I designed the whole thing in InDesign and placed
    entire pages as images. The only thing that I didn't really like was how the book
    block was attached to the hard bound spine. The white paper looks a bit flimsy,
    but the dust jacket covers most of that. The paper quality is ok and the images
    turned out nice, not super crisp but really decent. I also wish they had a choice
    for the color of the book cloth on hard bound, it is black.\r\n\r\nI hope that
    helps, I couldn't find any helpful reviews of their books when I was deciding."

  body: thanks for that review....from what i gather from other reviews on the net,
    people seem to have good things to say about it (although a few have had dissapointing
    results)..i suppose the only way to find out is to try myself...i reckon designing
    in InDesign & exporting each page as a hi-res jpeg is probably the best option
