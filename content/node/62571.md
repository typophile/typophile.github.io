    may not be a fair test because the Os in the logo look a lot rounder than the
    Os in Helvetica.

  body: "The test really should be can you spot Arial from the \"original\" since
    at least one of the logos (National) is clearly not Helvetica as can be seen in
    the treatment of the lowercase 'a' which has a different tail for bold and black
    weights than normal weight. In the case of National the type of tail is switched.
    It's a Grotesque variant, but not an official Helvetica. The author should have
    stuck to a list of companies where the use of Helvetica in the logos had been
    vetted like in the Wikipedia entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica.\r\n\r\nAs
    to the history of Arial, Wikipedia has a pretty good entry as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial.
    The articles linked in the footnotes reference good sources from what I can tell.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure where the myth Microsoft didn't want to pay royalties for Helvetica stems
    from but it's pretty ludicrous when you consider that the Microsoft logo is actually
    Helvetica minus the tweaked 'o' and the custom kerning (Why wasn't that one on
    the test). Furthermore, Microsoft doesn't own Arial, Monotype does and Microsoft
    licenses the font from them.\r\n\r\nAs some may have noticed that if Arial was
    almost an exact clone, people should be scoring much lower. If you used say Nimbus
    Sans or Swiss 721 I doubt many would be able to score so high. Granted, Arial
    is a Helvetica substitute because of the competition between IBM/Monotype vs Xerox/Linotype
    in the printer market in the early 80s.\r\n\r\nLetters: 'a', 'c', 'e', 'f', 'g',
    'j', 'r', 's', 't' and 'y' have strokes that end in a slant in Arial, while in
    Helvetica they end on the horizontal or perpendicular; however,  it can be hard
    to discern the slanted start or end stroke on the letters: 'f', 'g', 'j' and 'y'
    at smaller sizes."

    was hasty in saying Microsoft commissioned Arial. Indeed, they don't own it, I
    should have said they popularized it. But the royalty issue is still an issue.
    Obviously Arial was cheaper from Monotype than Helvetica was through Linotype.
    And the fact that Microsoft use it for their own logo doesn't really have anything
    to do with the fonts they package with their software. Licensing a font for a
    logo and for a software package vary greatly in price.\r\n\r\nI think the issue
    is that Microsoft picked the cheaper font to license thinking no one would know

    never heard a Microsoft employee discuss it. It just seems like the only answer.
    Why would you select a typeface with the exact same widths and spacing of one
    of the most popular typefaces in the world instead of just selecting that popular
    typeface?\r\n\r\nThere were other options, similar typefaces like Univers or even
    Monotype's Grotesque, but of course those don't share the same metrics as Helvetica.
    \r\n\r\nAnd it's not like Arial is the only example of this. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe|Segoe]]
    is a pretty recent example of Microsoft purchasing a Frutiger clone from Monotype.
    In this case it seems like an example of Monotype (who now owns Linotype) not
    willing to sell the Frutiger trademark so selling a knock off typeface instead.\r\n\r\nIf
    you can find any real information about why Microsoft really did select Arial,
    I'd love to see it. Mark Simonson wrote a great article on the subject a little
    while ago, [[http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html|The Scourge of Arial]].\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\r\n[[http://rbtl.us|Read

  body: "I suggest that the same width and spacing would be desirable for reasons
    such as interoperability and graceful degradation.\r\n\r\nHowever, this quality
    does not prevent introducing a new font. In essence, backwards compatibility allows
    some flexibility in design, provided that the technical metrics are unchanged.\r\n\r\nAlso
    note that sliding-scale economics in licensing means that a wealthy firm such
    as Microsoft might be asked to pay more than the going rate. I am not saying this
    is applicable, but its reasonable to think that licensing on such a large scale
    may have involved negotiation. In other words, Linotype may have thought they
    had Microsoft by the short & curlies, and subsequently upset Microsoft in the
    board room.\r\n\r\nI believe that Bill Gates once advocated the philosophy that
    power resides with those who control the underlying property. I am too lazy to
    seek a quote."

    (Parker read me an amazing back story he had written a while ago). He even went
    to the opening night for [[http://www.helveticafilm.com/|Helvetica]] without me
    and, and yesterday, he paid $100 to have the poster from the film framed. Needless
    to say, it's his favourite font. He's even started reading [[http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326|Bringhurst]]
    following a talk he gave at [[http://nscad.ca/en/home/default.aspx|NSCAD University]]
    (and yes, I got him to sign my copy).\r\n\r\nI sent him the \"Can you tell Helvetica
    from Arial?\" test and this is the email I got in return:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"<em>I got
    18 too!\r\nSome of the all caps were hard and the G in AGFA and TARGET got me.\r\nIf
    I had done some of the other all caps earlier I might have picked up on the tiny
    difference between the cap As\r\n\r\nSo, you should be very proud of your student!</em>\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPraise
    from Caesar. Thanks Ray.\r\n\r\n(PS: how do I indent a block quote?)"

  body: "Matt: <em>I think the issue is that Microsoft picked the cheaper font to
    license thinking no one would know the difference.</em>\r\n\r\nI doubt if licensing
    cost per se was the deciding factor. Microsoft was already involved in a production
    relationship with Monotype -- there were Monotype staff at Microsoft doing the
    TT hinting -- and Arial needs to be seen as part of a package with Times New Roman
    and Courier New.\r\n\r\nI also don't think Microsoft thought 'no one would know
    the difference' between Arial and Helvetica; rather, the difference simply didn't
    matter to Microsoft. They had a technical requirement for a sans serif core font:
    that it match Helvetica metrics such that documents created in Windows with Arial
    could be printed from a printer that used Helvetica.\r\n\r\n<em>Segoe is a pretty
    recent example of Microsoft purchasing a Frutiger clone from Monotype. In this
    case it seems like an example of Monotype (who now owns Linotype) not willing
    to sell the Frutiger trademark so selling a knock off typeface instead.</em>\r\n\r\nAt
    the time Segoe was developed, Monotype did not yet own Linotype. Far from Linotype
    being unwilling to license the Frutiger trademark, they had already licensed 'Frutiger
    Linotype' to Microsoft as a core font for the MS Reader. There really isn't a
    good explanation for Segoe if it is seen from the perspective of Microsoft looking
    for something that resembled Frutiger, because they already had a license for
    Frutiger. So clearly that perspective is erroneous. What MS were looking for,
    and what they had commissioned Monotype to produce, was a new UI font. I suspect
    the technical spec for this font was a lot more detailed than the design spec,
    which was probably pretty vague, e.g. \u2018clean, modern\u2019. And Monotype
    delivered what is either a deliberate Frutiger clone or something that by chance,
    from seeking to meet the technical and design briefs, turned out to be so much
    like Frutiger as to appear a clone to most people.\r\n\r\nHaving had some experience
    of delivering fonts for bundling with major software, and knowing how software
    development cycles work, I suspect there was a point at which MS either had to
    accept Segoe or throw a wrench in the entire Vista development schedule."
