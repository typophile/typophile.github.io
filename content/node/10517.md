  <BR>Iam unsure if this is to over designed but ive seen some nice resumes that were
  designed including samples of their work so i thought id try something like that.  <BR>
  <BR>I took a class on communication and my teacher suggested to design it how you
  like but to make sure it communicates to the reader clearly. <BR> <BR>I know that
  some of you all may look at resumes all day or have way more experience with them
  so i just wanted some feedback outside of my class. <BR> <BR>btw this is not nerely
  finished just a mock up  <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Greg<!--attachment: resume2005-70596.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*61.2**resume2005%2epdf

    would not be too bad a choice of wording if you are going for non-profit, otherwise
    skip it. <BR>I don&#39;t care for the word &#34;share&#34;, sounds evasive, or
    too humanitarian, as if this is some kind gesture to &#34;share&#34;. <BR> <BR>You
    spelled &#34;Knowlegde&#34;- incorrect. should be &#34;knowledge&#34; flip g-d.  <BR>
    <BR>Don&#39;t split word &#34;Oak-land&#34;, put it on same line. <BR> <BR>Correct
    spacing in 287 - 17th.  <BR> <BR>some places have state spelled out &#34;California&#34;,
    other places it is &#34;CA&#34; and even &#34;CA.&#34; be consistant.  <BR> <BR>Why
    have Zip codes on some addresses and not others? <BR> <BR>2 seperate blocks &#40;January
    2005-Present&#41; for essentially the same position at same company with same
    dates- looks like &#34;filler&#34;.  <BR> <BR>Some places have &#34;Street&#34;
    as &#34;St.&#34; other p[laces it is &#34;Streets&#34; again be consistant.  <BR>
    <BR>Why have Meena address in Oakland and also mention publication is published
    in Oakland- redundant filler.  <BR> <BR>Top contact info has phone number as <BR>&#40;510&#41;
    601.9962 below it is  <BR>510.601.9962, again be consistant make them the same.'

  body: thnx  ole, <BR> <BR>i will remember consistancy.  and omit share. i want to
    rewrite a lot of the stuff i just have it as filler kinda. but your proof already
    helped me to the next step. i was unsure about the layout i had another one and
    my teacher said it was weak so i spent a lot of time on the grid of this one.
    <BR> <BR>i will correct those errors and try to get another one up as soon as
    i can

  body: You might want to reconsider your pairing of types. The combination of super
    old style Adobe Jenson with ultra modern Helvetica is a little schizophrenic.
    You might consider a more humanistic sans or a more modern serif.

  body: 'Gregory, <BR> <BR>I would consider not putting any references on your resume.
    Just put &#34;Ask for references&#34; or don&#39;t put anything at all. One of
    the reasons is that they may want 1, or they may want 3-5. You never know. <BR>
    <BR>Something else that might be helpful is to list what &#34;Skills&#34; you
    have. Mine says &#34;Proficient on Mac and PC platforms. Software knowledge includes
    Photoshop CS and Imageready CS, Illustrator CS, Freehand 10, Dreamweaver MX, InDesign
    CS, QuarkXPress 4, Pagemaker 6, Flash MX, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MS Office, familiar
    with 3D Max.&#34; Software knowledge is a big deal with businesses and if you
    don&#39;t list what you know they may toss your resume. <BR> <BR>I would also
    focus on your name and make it more graphically interesting. You are trying to
    seperate yourself from the rest, especially in graphic design. Maybe make a logo
    &#40;made of just type&#41; using your name. Something that people will remember
    you by. <BR> <BR>I would take off objective and put it on your cover letter. Cover
    letters are also important. They let you customize your objectives specifically
    to the company you are applying for. You have to do some research into the company.
    I have talked with many business owners and some have said they throw Below is
    a template for a cover letter: <BR>___________________________ <BR>&#40;Insert

  body: "First off, it's looking a lot better. Your new choices in typefaces are a
    lot more \"boring\", but they also work together much better, and you don't really
    want flashy type in your r\xE9sum\xE9 anyway. It looks good now, although I'd
    still think hard about the division of text into two ragged columns, especially
    columns as widely spaced as the ones you have. I'm also not super-fond of the
    horizontal rules between job names and descriptions; it still feels like too strong
    a break.\r\n\r\nSecond, it's time to proofread that bad boy. Typos abound: \"mulitmedia
    applicaitons\", \"profficient\", and using \"rolls\" for \"roles\" are ones that
    popped out at me. Also, it's \"BBEdit\" and \"InDesign CS\". InterCaps are annoying,
    but there are right ways and wrong ways to use them, so better double-check your
    app names to make sure you have it right.\r\n\r\nOther than that, it's looking
    good!"
