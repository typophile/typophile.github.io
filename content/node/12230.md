body: "What is the # of em units to match a PC's pixel? ( Not a mac's ).\r\n\r\nThe
  reason I ask is that I have font which uses 1000 UPM & has 100em unit pixels ( vector
  not bitmap ). \r\n\r\nThis font looks nice &  crisp at 10 pt - on a mac. \r\n\r\nBut
  it does <strong>not</strong> look crisp at any size on the PC. It has been true
  type hinted ( which helped alot ) but it seems quite clear - it just isn't fitting
  the grid.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

    tweak it. Otherwise, 7.5 points should in theory render your font crisply.\r\n\r\nIn
    the not-too-distant future, operating systems will automatically query the resolution
    off the display using Extended Display Identification Data (EDID), so a \"pt\"
    will, once again, be 1/72\" or thereabouts."

  body: Testing in photoshop with a 96 dpi image rather than a 72dpi seemed to bear
    this idea out . :-) Yea! - I haven't been able to test it on a pc yet. Obviously
    this issue is only relevant if you are looking for a match *onscreeen* - the printed
    fonts would not match with this soultion. Still, that is what I was looking for.
    Thanks!
