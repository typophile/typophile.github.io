  of which I love, but are not much used. \r\n\r\nThe latter two are both by Zapf.
  The Renaissance is a wonderfully clear face, with character, but not too much. Aldus
  has a lovely hand woven feel to it. And Weiss is such a deco beaut, but again, very
  clear and unfussy.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts as to why we seem them so rarely??\r\n\r\nJohn"

  body: "More bias: we'd certainly see a lot more of them if there were Adobe Weiss
    and Aldus Next.\r\n\r\nBut seriously, a typeface becomes redundant unless it is
    revived with some semblance of a new idea, a reinterpretation to renew its relevance.
    That has happened with Garamond, Bodoni, Jenson, Optima even, but not yet with
    these other faces."

  body: Actually, there is an Aldus nova. It is delivered with the Palatino nova family.
    It is optimized, like Aldus itself, for book setting.

  body: "> Aldus has suffered in the shadow of Palatino?\r\n\r\nI concur. Aldus is
    basically the \"optical\" size of Palatino for books. You have to make the effort
    to buy it, too. AND it has a different name, so its readiness may not always be
    apparent, AND it was never mass-bundled, unlike Palatino itself.\r\n\r\n(\u2026AND

    used Aldus as the text face of a magazine, with Palatino Bold as its bold, but

  body: Yeah, but names count for a lot. If Aldus had been named Palatino Book, I
    believe that it would have found much higher distribution. Its intended name back
    in the 1950s was Palatino Light, I think. But the D. Stempel AG and/or German
    Linotype marketers at the time wanted to give it a different name. I guess what
    helped back then is a hindrance now?

    you know the book <a href=\"http://www.delphipress.com/\">'Fonts & Logos' by Doyald
    Young?</a> Features quite a lot of beautiful Zapf work and comments about same,
    which I hadn't known about. I agree with the other respondents here that Aldus
    and Zapf Renaissance were simply outshone or out-marketed (depending on your degree
    of cynicism) by the rest of the man's prodigious output. And Aldus may be underrated,
    but that 'one weight only' thing does get in the way.\r\n\r\nWeiss may be unfussy,
    and may be quite like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/atf/bernhard-modern/familytree.html\">Bernhard
    Modern</a> in terms of its elegant proportion, but I recall using it as a business
    report text face and it appears very pale \u2013 a bit spidery really, on the

  body: "I agree, I love all three of those designs. Zapf-Renaissance was one of the
    most expensive single font packages I've ever bought. I believe I dropped $300
    or so on it back in 1996 or thereabouts. I bought it from Fonthaus, who was distributing
    it for Scangraphic. I think Scangraphic's collection was later absorbed by E+F
    or Linotype.\r\n\r\nIt could use an overhaul. There were some metrics and kerning
    problems with the version I bought.\r\n\r\nThe complaint about the absence of
    a <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/109964/aldusnovabookbold-font.html\">bold
    verison of Aldus</a> and <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/109961/aldusnovabookitalic-font.html\">its
    corresponding italic</a> is now answered with the Aldus Nova release, but for
    now it's only available as part of the large Palatino Nova package bundle. Sadly
    it will be a while before I have the $999 to spend just to get to those two new
    weights. Palatino Nova is also missing Palatino Heavy, which I was always fond
    of. I also miss the look of the foundry versions and the alternate extenders,
    and the original Palatino Italic swashes. Seeing those is still a rare treat."
