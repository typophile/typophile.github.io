    are content-challenged I guess. But the store where it's at is very close to me,
    so the next time I drive by it I'll emergency-park, jump in, take a photo and
    scram, at the expense of being too embarassed of ever showing my face in that
    store again.  :-)\r\n\r\nOr I can call them and ask.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBTW, I just
    realized what that \"g\" reminds me of: the voluptuous* succubus\r\nthat somebody
    at House once drew. Does anybody have an image of that?\r\n\r\n* Do they make
    them any other way? Are there waify succubi?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n\r\n"
