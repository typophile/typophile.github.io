    text, and I don't think there's anything particularly subliminal about type. It's
    emotive, and wrapped within its cultural context. The face is a conduit of whatever
    aesthetic proclivities you're bringing to the table... I'm not going to finish
    reading that article.

  body: "That's like asking: Do books really matter. If not for the invention of the
    printing press and the artisans who followed how many books would be around today.
    The English statesman and philosopher Francis Bacon wrote that typographical printing
    has \"changed the whole face and state of things throughout the world\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    even though innovation and mass production has improved all of our lives, it has
    also created the impression of uniformity. We live in a constantly changing and
    more complex world. As a result, we use the technology but few of us really understand
    it. Unless you are 'in the business', so to speak, it's difficult for many to
    appreciate the work that goes into creating a 'beautiful piece of furniture',
    a 'fine painting', an 'emotional piece of music', or for that matter, a 'typeface'.
    \r\n\r\nThat's why only type designers and graphic artists get excited about this
    wonderful craft of ours. Good typography is a labor of love. Just like a musician
    fine tunes his music, we love to deal with the intricacies of our craft.\r\n\r\nI
    remember trying to explain to my wife what I did for a living. I remember her
    saying, \"but, all '26 letters' of the alphabet are already made. They exist.
    What does a type designer do\"?\r\n\r\nAnd, that my friends, is what we all initially
    have to deal with. Oh, after I explained to her the whole picture, she finally
    got it. She now is my biggest fan.\r\n\r\nAnd, that's what we have to do with
    the rest of the world. It's our job to educate them. With time, I'm sure that
    many will come to understand and appreciate what we do, and how we all have contributed
    to this wonderful medium we play in.\r\n\r\nSo, keep those great new fonts coming.
    I'm already working on the next one :)"

    write well.\r\nThat means not biting off more than he can chew.\r\nIf you are
    going to write about the kind of issues that are discussed in specialist forums
    or trade journals, then you have to really narrow your focus.\r\nThis article
    would have been better if the writer had stuck to Papyrus in <em>Avatar</em>,
    which he discusses prominently, (although that's a bit tardy by now.) \r\nPerhaps
    Bruno's new font is the most current news here in this NEWS magazine, but Helvetica
    too is old hat (the movie came out several years ago), and a font press release
    isn't really news. So that might explain the random ballooning of content. I'm
    surprised Comic Sans wasn't mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis is typical -- a little bit
    of news is stitched together with unconnected intersections between type and popular
    culture (e.g. Barnbrook namedrops Bowie), with a primer thrown in for good measure.
    And a manufactured controversy for balance and sensationalism. I mean, if your
    biggest naysayer source is a \"Canadian blogger\"... \r\nIt's just bad writing
    and editing."

    these articles are usually written because of public outrage over the cost of
    some corporate typeface. Most people won't notice that BBC changed Verdana for
    Arial on their website. And most people wouldn't really think there is a big difference
    from one typeface to the next, not consciously at least. So they can't see why
    so much money is spent on such an insignificant aspect."

  body: "When I taught a course in book design, I told my students that typography
    is like music. \r\nYou don't have to know music theory to be moved by music. You
    may not know one note from another, or what syncopation means, but the music still
    makes you react: One tune makes you want to cry, another makes you want to dance.\r\nTypography
    works the same way. You may not know Bodoni from baloney, but the choices a designer
    made cause you to see a page of text as easy or rigorous, old-fashioned or modern.
    \r\nThat's why typography matters. Readers may not respond to type the same way
    professional designers do, but they <em>do</em> respond. "

    it conveys a subliminal message in the letter shapes themselves. That\r\ncivilizations
    created religious icons from letters and symbols is not without foundation. Good
    typography significantly increases the amount of attention a message receives.
    The right typeface is the basis of strong communication.\r\n\u2003Type alone cannot
    sustain a brand name or a corporate identity, but a brand with the wrong typeface
    will flounder helplessly trying to define itself. Type, layout, and color make
    up the equallateral triangle of brand identity. Like everything else in life,
    to be successful with type you have to first choose the right one, and then use
    it well. \r\n\u2003There is no foolproof recipe for selecting the right type for
    each and every purpose. Choosing the right type requires experience, intuition,
    and creativity. Which type best suits the headline, subhead, and copy of an ad,
    which for packaging design, which for technical products, and which for food\u2013in-depth

    advertising, tricking people into buying stuff.\r\n\r\nBut really, the \"subliminality\"
    of type is no different than, say, the music in a movie soundtrack, which is a
    far more manipulative way to work on people's emotions.\r\n\r\nHow about hair
    styling? That's designed to send subconscious messages too.\r\nBut no one calls
    it subliminal.\r\n\r\nAll areas of design involve subconscious communication.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if the advertising in a publication targets readers with clever manipulation of
    graphic imagery, how is that different than the editorial (bastion of democracy
    and civilization), the typography of which targets its demographic in exactly
    the same manner?"

    there are aspects of design that involve experiential associations that do not
    need to be formulated as thoughts and generally are not. This is what we mean
    when we say that a design evokes a sense of something. If we bothered, we could
    probably formulate that sense as a thought, which effectively means giving it
    linguistic expression. That we generally don't bother doesn't require a concept
    of the subliminal or the subconscious, it just means that it isn't necessary to
    the experience."

    you're not thinking about the font\". Not only does this misrepresent what was
    said (\"When you're reading an article you're not thinking about the font consciously.
    It's the unconscious that has the emotional influence, as with shapes, as with
    colours. It is the designers job to consider the impact of all the above.\") but
    it also puts it in the mouth of the wrong person.\r\n\r\nMore generally, I'd like
    to point out how much more type-positive the comments are, compared to the text.
    Maybe the dumbed down version was a little too dumb?"
