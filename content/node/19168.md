  magazine. Currently set in Champion (all caps, bold condensed). I'm looking at Meta,
  as it's got a lot more personality, just thought I'd see if anyone had any other
  suggestions. Bearing in mind the number of characters it has to be slightly condensed.\r\n\r\nThanks
  all"

    is that Meta might be a little busy for a masthead, DIN or transit might be a
    better option in the same food group"

    </a> or <a href="http://vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/">Apex New?</a>
    Though, I think both of them are probably too wide for a masthead.

    1.</a> I'm not sure what you're after, I think Meta may be too warm for "PCAuthority".
    Is that the magazine we get here in Australia?

    of a magazine is actually the block of information of who "mans the ship" so to
    speak--editor-in-chief, design director, etc... '

    best-known face is without doubt FF Meta, whose lively shapes give it a distinctive
    character -- often too much so for headlines. Enter FF Meta Headline. Under the
    direction of Spiekermann & Christian Schwartz, Joshua Darden created three widths
    (normal, condensed, compressed) with four weights each. There are several alternate
    characters for tight setting: an \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018l\u2019 without tails
    and a simple \u2018g\u2019. A few arrows and dingbats are also included.</blockquote>"
