  wine and clients never EVER want to change anything in your beautiful designs, the
  reality of design is often that it must be done quickly and to a strict budget.
  Clients are ever demanding and want good professional designs quickly, they don\u2019t
  want to hire that great freelance photographer you know of, or splash out on a custom
  font. Educating people as to what is possible and how much it will cost is something
  all designers could probably do more of, but what about until then?\r\n\r\nYes designing
  with restrictions is probably something we must all learn to do, so here are a couple
  of the resources I reguarly use for the quick jobs. YES I would rather spend the
  hours and money doing something much nicer, and NO, you probably won\u2019t find
  this in my portfolio section, but at least the job got done and the client was happy.
  Hope you find them useful...\r\n\r\nwww.istock.com\r\nThis is one we have probably
  all used at some point. It offers large images at about \xA320 each and cheaper
  if they are for web or smaller print. Your client can probably just about cope with
  those kind of figures. A lot of them are a bit tacky, ut there is the odd gem in
  there too.\r\n\r\nwww.shutterstock.com\r\nIn the same mould as istock really, but
  works with a different pay scheme. Think it works out about \xA3350 a month. But
  for that, you can download up to 25 images a day. We keep this at all times and
  it can be really useful for putting together quick new business documents. It has
  a much larger database than istock, and also offers you the chance to download eps
  files which can be used directly in illustrator. The chances are that most of them
  won\u2019t be beautiful, but with your acute designers eye, you van pull elements
  from several and put them together to create a master piece. The chances are that
  if you want to create a victorian style \u2018twirly\u2019 pattern, you will be
  able to find something here that helps you. The bad news in this site is that the
  search function is pretty poor and it can be hard to find the right image because
  of the sheer quantity there are on there. Again like i-stock most of the images
  are not great, but you can find something useful.\r\n\r\nsxc.hu\r\nAs far as I am
  aware, this is a rarity. A website that offers free large scale images for download.
  Thats right, they will not cost anything. It is pretty much amateur-ish photography,
  but I have found the odd OK one. And hey, who can argue at that price.\r\n\r\nwww.flickr.com/photos/tags/commercial/\r\nOK,
  bit of a cheating one here as I am not quite sure what the rights are as to using
  these images. But for quick mockups or new business presentations you can get away
  with it. There are a great selection here. If you ever want images of a sports crowd,
  or something quite real, but fresh, this is a cool place. The searching is pretty
  cool, and most images come in a decent size.\r\n\r\nFONTS\r\n\r\nwww.dafont.com\r\nThis
  is a great resource for designing logos and branding and can be great for making
  something look that little bit different. Its got some really cool and original
  fonts up there and the great news is its all pretty much open source. The search
  and classification options are really easy to use as well. I think they suit logo
  design the best; All the minute details of spacing are not always perfect, but with
  some slight adjusting can look really good.\r\n\r\nWhat the font\r\nThis is a good
  resource for identifying fonts. All you do is upload a black and white image of
  the font and hit the search button. Fingers crossed and it will identify your font.
  Its by no means 100%, and really bespoke fonts will probably not show up, but for
  those normal ones that you cant quite place, its pretty useful. You need a fairly
  good quality image or scan of the font though, so this can sometimes be a stumbling
  block.\r\n\r\nThese are  just some of the resources I use. Do you have any good
  shortcuts you want to share?\r\n\r\nAny opinions welcome...\r\n"
