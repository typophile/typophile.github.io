  couture section. I believe that this should be arial and am not 100% certain. I
  am looking up this information in order to make changes to the website and insure

  body: When you say "under the couture section," I can only assume you mean the main
    body copy appearing to the right when you click on "couture" from the nav. It
    looks like Verdana 10pt.
