  body: "That's quite cool but for the fact that one couldn't think of too many typefaces
    less appropriate than Avant Garde to express the idea of a garden.\r\n\r\nHaving
    said that, I've never really found out why it's hated so much.   "

    happy, if that's what I want to do)."

    you\u2019ll get to where you can order. It\u2019s all brasilian, though.\r\n\r\nThink
    it\u2019s interesting that they took an existing logo (more than using the typeface)
    as a basis, and added the NER. Wonder if they know about the origin."

    particular aspect, I was just thinking of the Avant Garde magazin logo in general.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avant2_5283.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avant3_3412.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avant5_4971.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avant6_5560.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/avant7_3902.jpg]"

    from it.
