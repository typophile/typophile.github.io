  The image attached is Serge from Cyrus Highsmith. I am looking for sans serif (or
  serif as a plan B) typefaces that has similar exaggerated diagonals. So to be more
  clear I want the diagonal strokes to almost touch the baseline and this makes triangular
  counters. I would appreciate if you can recommend some options.\r\nThanks.\r\nalp\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
