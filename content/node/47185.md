  a partial answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nmbcohen \r\n8.Jul.2008 12.09am \r\nCan anyone help
  me identify the slab-serif typeface used on so many Bantam paperbacks of the 70s?
  Always with outline and heavy shadow. It resembles a condensed bold Clarendon, but
  the R is distinctive.\r\n\r\nYou can kind of see it in a terrible image here, from
  the 1970 edition of Ross MacDonald\u2019s THE GOODBYE LOOK: http://www.yesterdaysmuse.com/shop_image/product/067351.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nTo
  which SuperUltraFabulous very kindly replied:\r\n\r\nSuperUltraFabulous \r\n8.Jul.2008
  1.28am\r\nHello there:\r\n\r\nJust so you know this topic should be posted in the
  Font ID forum not in the Design forum.\r\n\r\nNo problem tho, this is Profil (not
  a misspelling)\r\n\r\nGet the Bitstream version here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/decorated-035/\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nMikey
  :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, while Profil/Decorated 035 is definitely a recognizable
  paperback titling font from the era, and I can definitely use it, it's not quite
  the one. It is too much of an oblique.  \r\n\r\nI would appreciate any further assistance
  anybody might be able to give.\r\n\r\nMalachi\r\n\r\n"
