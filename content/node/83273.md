  dextrous handwriting. While I am studying FontLab, I would also like to find out
  how to approach digital font publishing, distribution, as well as the steps for
  the acquisition of a trademark for the typeface name.\r\n\r\nI would certainly appreciate
  your suggestions and references.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    for it,\r\nyou're better off publishing it yourself - and probably selling it
    via MyFonts.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: MyFonts is great. Fontspring is also great and pays a much bigger royalty,
    but doesn't have the audience of casual font-browsing-shoppers.

    about the copyright and/or trademark for a name? Get a lawyer? Costs? The most
    effective ways to search to make sure a name is not already being used?\r\n\r\n"

    you show us an example of the font?\r\n\r\nThe sad reality is, there are already
    lots and lots of fonts out there. Unless you've got something really outstanding,
    your chances for commercial success are slim. So what are your goals in publishing
    your font? There may be other motives than to make money from it, influencing
    your decisions."

  body: "Thank you riccard0 and Jens for connecting me to the very helpful threads
    on copyright and trademark.\r\n\r\nYes, there are already lots and lots of fonts
    out there. No drawings to share yet. Check out the MyFonts interview with Gerard
    Unger: \r\n\r\n\"... I see too much repetition right now. Many of the \u201Cnew\u201D
    sans serifs, for instance, are trying to fill ever smaller gaps between existing
    sans serifs. If type designers would concentrate more on originality, not only
    personal originality, but trying to find answers to original design challenges...\"\r\n"
