  body: Since &#39;similar&#39; is best defined by the person asking, you might see
    something that you consider similar enough by looking through <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 7 &#40;Casual Flowing Script&#41; in the Script Font ID Guide</a>.
    There are 11 pages of fonts that resemble this style to one degree or another.
    It&#39;s also possible that Part 9 &#40;Everyday Handwriting&#41; might have some
    more candidates, but I think I would look first in Part 7. <BR> <BR>If you want
    a few suggestions for &#39;similar&#39; to my eyes, Bickley Script &#40;Part 7
    pg 1&#41;, Rage Italic &#40;pg 3&#41;, or Shimmer &#40;pg 11&#41;. In Part 9,
    you might consider Handsome &#40;pg 2&#41;, Stanford Script &#40;pg 4&#41;, or
    Velvet Script &#40;Pg. 7&#41;. <BR> <BR>Use the Script Font Reference List links
    on the bottom of the pages to find the designer and supplier of any you are interested
    in.
