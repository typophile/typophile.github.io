  body: And the G too. The serifs on G and S &#40;not the surf / skate company&#41;
    seem too blocky and awkward, like they belong on a lettermean&#39;s sweater. Is
    it just me? And the serifs are driving me crazy on the black weight. I can&#39;t
    figure out how to incorporate them. I don&#39;t know how you real type designers
    handle all of this stuff. <BR> <BR>P.S. For those who are curious, here&#39;s
    an image of the original from the book. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/65593.jpg"

  body: Holy smokes. I should have figured someone had done something. My main objective
    is taking it way past the original weights and making a black extended monstrosity,
    but in a good way, so hopefully I&#39;ll be safe as far as not redoing something
    that&#39;s already been done.
