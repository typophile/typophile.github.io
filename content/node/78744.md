  play in my DVD player nor my computer (in fact it crashed the latter). \r\n\r\nIf
  I had looked more carefully at the case in the first place, I would have known from
  the beginning that it was a counterfeit DVD. See what I'm talking about?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Scan_5795.png]"

  body: "Here's their web site: [[http://www.helveticafilm.com/shop.html]]\r\n\r\nand
    it is true the real DVDs and Blu-Ray disks pictured there look different.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the lowercase \"a\" still looks like the one in Arial, rather than the one in
    Swiss 721 or Heros.\r\n\r\nHowever, Adobe Helvetica Bold, on the MyFonts site
    (unlike the lighter weights; but none of them are comparable to Helvetica Medium)
    actually has the smaller terminal on the lowercase a.\r\n\r\nSo does Helvetica
    Neue Bold, although Helvetica Neue Medium still has the little tail.\r\n\r\nI'm
    going to dig up my old Letraset catalogue to see some real Helvetica. It's beginning
    to look like Helvetica is becoming Arial, at least in the heavier weights."

    in ITC Garamond</a>. Now, thirty plus years later, we see it set in Arial. It
    looks like we are finally getting somewhere."

  body: "And, indeed, it is Arial. While the lowercase \"a\" does not have its distinctive
    tail in authentic Helvetica Medium - as I was able to confirm from an old Letraset
    catalogue - the lowercase \"t\" still does have a flat top, while in Arial, it
    has a slanted top.\r\n\r\nAnd the authentic DVDs on the web site do have the correct
    lowercase \"t\"."
