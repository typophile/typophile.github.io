  body: "The book is by [[Otl Aicher]]... that shudda been a dead giveaway!\r\n\r\nFYI--
    the book was originally typeset using a pre-released version of Aicher's Rotis.
    After we got it at Agfa-Cg (Monotype Imaging) we did a lot of re-tooling the outlines
    and spacing (with the blessing of Herr Aicher)."
