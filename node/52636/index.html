<p>The space inside some of the ligatures is kind of tight, and I don&rsquo;t think making ligatures off the arm of the &ldquo;r&rdquo; is such a good idea. I know that r makes a big negative space that wants to be filled, but doing so makes it hard to recognize. Some end-user might even foolishly kern the r too close to the n in an attempt to make it match the other r ligatures, which would result in a shape indistinguishable from the m.</p>

<p>That makes sense. Do you thing I should remove all contextual substitutions with r (its not a ligature) or just particular ones? Could a kerning adjustment solve the readability issue? 
There is no possibility that an end-user kerns it too close to n, as the only user of the font will be me and any employees of the company (which currently only has 1 employee, so that&rsquo;s quite easy to avoid). As I said, it won&rsquo;t be sold or given away, its aimed just for the company&rsquo;s corporate identity and any projects it owns.
Also, which ligatures (or contextual sbustitutions) do you think have tight counters? Does this occur in all sizes on just particular ones? (I know that my hinting sucks on some letters :-()</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

You are right about the rn, I&rsquo;ll think what I can do about it. Although, since I&rsquo;m going to be mostly using it, and I don&rsquo;t plan to make the kerning different than the default (since I planned the default :P), if I properly adjust it in the kern feature and ovserve it in various sizes I guess it will be okay, right?</p>
<p>@all: Any comments on the glyphs? One concern that I have is that I think (and 2 people that have seen the font confirmed that) the H,K and X look a lot alike in small sizes. Also, I&rsquo;m sceptical about the shape of my g.</p>

<p>The isolated s has terrible hinting, and even though I tried hard to fix it (it was even worse before), it still looks bad, especially on small sizes. I guess this is why you suggested changing it, right? It doesn&rsquo;t actually look that bad&hellip; If only I figure out how to correctly hint it&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks to your comment, I noticed that actually, the double (triple, etc&hellip;) esses don&rsquo;t have the same distance from the joining stroke (it&rsquo;s very apparent on the logo), which increases the effect that you mentioned. I&rsquo;ll add that to the list of things I need to fix (together with cuttlefish&rsquo;s suggestion), thanks. :) I can&rsquo;t ditch them completely though, especially for them I considered the readability issue a lot since they are in the logo too, designed LOTS of alternative joins (more than 20 I think!) and finally decided to go with looks on this particular one (by the way, the logo in the demo picture is a mix of contextual alternates and a ligature, not a copy-paste of the original one. In the actual logo, the esses have equal distance from the joining stroke). Its the only glyph (actually it consists of more than one, but that&rsquo;s a technicality) that I have given so much thought about, and designed so many alternatives, so I won&rsquo;t ditch it, sorry. Tell me to change anything in the font, any glyph, any metric, just not my beloved esses (and the ff ligature), these are my favorites! :'-(</p>

<p>Whatever you like. Show the typeface. It could be just what you gave in the .gif now, but then as pdf (as vectors). :)</p>
<p>PDF gives us more freedom for looking at the design. Zoom in/out to see it at different sizes, or even print it to judge it even better. :)</p>
