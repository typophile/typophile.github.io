body: "Hey there,\r\n   New user here. I have a long-running web site which I built
  myself as a hobby, but which gets tens of thousands of visitors each month. I want
  to do a thorough redesign on the cheap (i.e., I'll be doing it), with elegance,
  simplicity, and usability as the key goals. It's an arts and humanities site with
  some scholarly leanings, so I'm going for a classic look without being stuffy. If
  there is some personality and history to the design rather than just being \"boilerplate
  classicism,\" all the better.\r\n\r\n   In the past I've used sans serif (Verdana
  mostly) for body type, but as I learn more, I really would like to go with a (humanist?)
  serif face that has some history to it. I love the Centaur Monotype example on p.
  67 of _Font. The Sourcebook_, so that might give an idea of my leanings.\r\n\r\n
  \  I'd like input as to where I can best learn more. I have been trolling through
  these forums most of the day, but I haven't hit the great threads yet, I guess.
  I'd like any advice on good threads here, good web resources (specific articles
  are the best), books, people to contact, anything, to help me answer some of the
  questions below. If someone feels super charitable and wants to dispense some wisdom
  in this thread, all the better!\r\n\r\nThanks for your advice.\r\n\r\nThe Questions\r\n1.
  What are some good fonts that have a classic-but-not-stuffy style to them, and are
  readable in blocks of body text on screens at 10-12 points?\r\n\r\n2. Are any of
  them free or inexpensive (less than $50, say?).\r\n\r\n3. Any example web sites
  that you think do a good job of a clean, readable, classic style with a bit of personality?
  For example, I like McSweeney's and A List Apart, though my site has a bit more
  color than those.\r\n\r\n4. If my favorite so far is Centaur Monotype, what are
  the best versions of that for screen viewing (most people seem to think it's not
  good at small sizes)? How else should I branch out (yes, I have been reading everything
  I can by raph. It looks like his versions will be incomplete for a while yet?)?\r\n\r\n5.
  If I use something like Centaur for body type, what might I look at for headlines?
  For even smaller sizes like footnotes? Any thoughts on the number of fonts in my
  arsenal for a consistent and coherent web site? I have seen several columns advocating
  no more than three or four fonts and scales...\r\n\r\n6. Any good resources targeted
  at CSS and font stacks by really good designers? I've been reading a lot of stuff
  by techies who have just a hint of font knowledge, but there must be better stuff
  out there. I'm generally inclined to forgo universality in favor of style, especially
  with upcoming improvements in HTML5 and CSS3.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nChris \r\n\r\n "
