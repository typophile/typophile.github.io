  body: Motter Tektura has been one of the typefaces that've been cloned by SoftMaker
    as "M650 Deco" (re-numbered from Marina, SoftMaker's original version of Motter
    Tektura), and'll also be another version of Motter Tektura, under license from
    URW++/SoftMaker, with an all-new font name being "Texture" (which, unlike M650
    Deco/Marina, has the lowercase letter "k" not being altered, as it looks quite
    original).    Both of which are appearing on "infiniType 4" and "MegaFont XXL
    3.0" (two premium-quality typeface collections from SoftMaker), both being released
    around May 27, 2014.

  body: "Both of those Softmaker offerings are absolutely jam packed with ripoffs
    of commercial fonts. Is \"cloned\" supposed to be a nice word for this?\r\n\r\nGerman
    law on font protection must be seriously weaker than the already weak law of the
    US."
