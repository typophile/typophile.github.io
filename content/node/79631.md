body: "La MEME being French for \"The Same,\" or \"same,\" the M and E letterforms
  are supposed to have similarity with one another.\r\n\r\nI realize it's somewhat
  Russian in style but that is intended and an acceptable association.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  I think I'm looking for a swash \"La,\" but haven't found a nice enough balance
  between the inherent elegance of a swash and a heavier form to match the letterforms
  shown here.\r\n\r\nAm I looking for a hybrid-style swash? In any case, some suggestions
  for a \"La\" face?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Green_ColorMockUp_5683.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
  I suppose I should mention--some of you enjoy kerning so if it's off might as well
  let me know!\r\n\r\nThanks all"

    swashy foundries - <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Sudtipos/\">Suditpos</a>
    in Argentina. (They have a great <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com\">website,</a>
    but MyFonts is faster to load samples.) \r\n\r\nI don't know what the brand is,
    so it's hard to know exactly what you're looking for. I'd play with Mr Dafoe,
    Kilo, Mrs. Sheppards, Chocolate, Whomp, RadioTime and Milk Script.  Cascabel could
    work, too, but it's far from a swash.  "

    scripts. \r\n\r\nI hadn't found what I wanted--but I hadn't completely articulated
    precisely what direction I needed when I went through it the last time. I'll def.
    review it, but (people out there) please do point me at some suggestions."

  body: In case you won't find a descent hybrid swash, you can look at the FF Ginger's
    flamboyant for inspiration. What i find interesting here, is the contrast between
    the brutish simple letterforms and the exquisite crazy swashes added "randomly"
    to this. http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ginger/regular-flamboyant/

  body: "What about contrasting just weight and style, but maintaining angularity?\r\nFor
    example:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/fig-script/\r\n\r\nOr, at
    least, some angularity?\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/master-script/\r\n\r\n(By
    the way, I find MEME nice. Maybe spaced a little too thight when small. Also,
    I think you could enlarge the left counter on E. It helps reading at small sizes.
    Sigma-shaped E is pretty recognizable.)"

  body: "I'm sure I do make these things tough on the crowd, because I don't like
    to give anything away--being somewhat wary about the stealing of work or ideas.
    \r\n\r\nI mean really it'll end up on my online portfolio but I'll try and minimize
    the places one might be able to grab this or that. Plus it doesn't say much about
    me as a designer if I ask about every little decision. It's more fun to come to
    the solution through trial and error til you're happy. Right?\r\n\r\nAnyways,
    after seeing some examples I'm thinking the La really does need to exude some
    elegance--it just needs to be weighty and elegant. Which still might be difficult
    to find. But hairlines don't hold up against these monoliths.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    the compliment Riccardo. I like the kerning at the large scale so maybe I'll create
    a size-specific version for the small. I'll see if adjusting the counter works
    as well."

  body: "Thanks for the reference to Mea Culpa.\r\n\r\nAlthough I did not decide on
    it, it got me in the right direction. If anyone has a similar problem in the future,
    well my solution was to look at BRUSH scripts. \r\n\r\nI settled on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/sheila/bold/|Shela
    Bold]]. To my eye it has a nice mix between \"brush\" and pen stroke, perhaps
    more towards the latter, but its weight is still heavier than more of the standard
    scripts I was looking trying to avoid."

    larger, which I compensated for but it's just not visible in this web-image."
