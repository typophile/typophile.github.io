body: "Once again I have fallen under the influence of my <A href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/fontcraft/?p=1301\">fashion
  conscious</a> teenage daughter, who tells me that I absolutely must produce more
  \"shabby chic\" fonts like the <a href=\"http://www.useyourtype.blogspot.com/\">trendy
  scrapbookers</a> and <a href=\"http://grayhood.com/\">hip fashion label designers</a>
  use.  On showing her examples this turns out to mean more circus style fonts with
  wide ascenders and decoration.  We did this dance once before the the <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=cascade\">Cascade</a>
  font and she wasn't entirely satisfied.  It was too <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/fontcraft/?p=1437\">Art
  Deco</a> and not crude enough looking.\r\n\r\nSo, against my natural inclination
  to tweak everything to perfection I found some sample letters from a 19th century
  poster and developed a full alphabet from them without pushing too hard for perfect
  lines and symmetry.  The result is the new Andrano font with a name picked because
  there's something sort of Italian looking about the font.  It features wide and
  ornate characters with jewel-like internal embellishments and a subtle built-in
  shadow to give the illusion of depth.  The upper case characters are somewhat skewed
  and misaligned versions of the standard character set.  So far my teenaged adviser
  is fairly pleased with it and she claims that because of her influence it will be
  a sure bestseller, so here it is.\r\n\r\nFor more info and to download the demo
