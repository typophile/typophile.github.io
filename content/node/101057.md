  post a picture of one again on the bottom here, but the thing is that I used Hoefler's
  Whitney and Chronicle on them, and now I'm trying to design my website and I'm going
  for something very minimalistic, like the cards, and I want to make it all consistent,
  the cards, stationary, the site, but Hoefler's license doesn't allow their fonts
  to be used with @fontface, so I'm looking for alternatives I can use. Since the
  site will be mostly just text I want something really well designed, and a family
  with various weights and nice italics and small caps and all that would be great.
  And of course both typefaces have to work well together, on the webpage they'll
  interact even more than they do on the cards. They actually don't even have to be
  thaaat similar to Hoefler's, but I want to convey that same feeling the cards have
  and I don't want to make something dissonant. And I'll also use that same little
  couch you can see on the card, so the type has to work well with that too. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nHere's
  my card:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4150.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, and
  I almost forgot... the site's in portuguese, so it has to be a font with diacritic
  marks and accents and all. I've been looking at some of the typefaces from The League
  of Moveable Type and most of them won't work for me because of that, which is very
  disappointing.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nDaniel"

    What do you guys think? Too obvious? Any better suggestions? And what serif do
    I pair it with?'
