body: I&#39;m working on desiging &#40;or starting to design&#41; a signage system
  for a college, specifically for a particular building which used to be an office
  building, and so has lots of hallways and suites, and now classrooms. I don&#39;t
  really know where to begin. Can anyone recommend resources to refer to when developing
  a signage system of this sort? Anything I should keep in mind besides the basic
  legibility and such, particularly when choosing a typeface? Thanks!

    signage, indicating that at least one academic institution &#40;and one with a
    serious typography department&#41; found it appropriate.

  body: 'I really don&#39;t have much experience designing sign systems themselves.
    I&#39;ve only done one signage project ever, and it was only temporary. <BR> <BR>As
    far as typefaces go, the requirements for internal signage for an academic environment
    would be quite different form say an airport or a highway. For room labels, I
    dare say, would not be that much different than designing for print, say a poster.
    But for larger signs, those that would be read from a fair distance, as a rule,
    would need more space between letters than for print. What looks perfectly alright
    close up would appear much tighter when seen from a distance, hampering legibility
    greatly. Counters generally have to be large and open, again for legibility reasons.
    I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have figures to support my arguments, or any hard and
    fast rules in terms of scale and how much the spacing should be. The best bit
    of advice I could give would be: always test at actual size. Do test prints, hang
    them up in the hallways, step back and see how well they read. That&#39;s essential.
    <BR> <BR>For a much more empricial approach, you should contact James Montalbano,
    who designed Clearview for US highways. He would be a much more appropriate person
    to ask for advice. He gave the most fascinating presentation at TypeCon. Are you
    around, James? <BR> <BR>Johnathan, maybe you would be interested in looking at
    Paul Mijksenaar&#39;s work? <a href="http://www.mijksenaar.com/index2.html" target="_blank">http://www.mijksenaar.com/index2.html</a>

    any previous signage, because until now it&#39;s all been very inconsistent and
    not very good. There is, however, a new trademark: <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14202.gif"
    alt=""> which uses ITC New Baskerville and a bit of another face. The signage
    may or may not incorporate this logo. This is a Bible college, and so all the
    majors at this point are Biblical studies and training for pastors and that sort
    of thing. Therefore I&#39;d like a look which conveys an idea of ancient sacred
    dignity or something like that.'

  body: Although it is the &#39;corporate&#39; face for the college, I don&#39;t think
    Baskerville would be an appropriate choice for a signage system. The contrast
    is too high and the type too feeble to function well as a signage type. <BR> <BR>The
    &#39;corporate&#39; face for the Vancouver Public Library system is Didot, and,
    believe it or not, that&#39;s what they use for all their architectural lettering
    and signage across the system! It&#39;s bloody hard to read! The hairlines almost
    disappear! <BR> <BR>It sure would be nice to use something that subtly convey
    &#39;ancient sacred dignity&#39; in one way or another, but I feel that it need
    not be a serif type. Have you seen the new Anglican service books? They use Gill
    Sans in black and red they they look very diginified and religious. Yet modern.
    It&#39;s a great design, IMHO. <BR> <BR>I have a semi-sans that might work well
    for this project, but unfortunitely it hasn&#39;t been produced yet :-P
