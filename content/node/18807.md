body: "I have two fairly general questions, and feel kind of newbish for not understanding
  these in my third year of school but here goes anyways.\r\n\r\nI'm frequently using
  the lab workstations which are already preloaded with a set of 'Studio Fonts.' There
  are times where I want to use Small Caps but I have no idea if the families they've
  bought include the SC style or not. I could obviously hit the SC buttons in Quark
  or InDesign but that doesn't solve my problem. I want to know how to determine if
  they're faux or real. Hopefully there's an easy way.\r\n\r\nAnother question I have,
  which I didn't think deserved another thread was I just bought the Indie Fonts Vol
  1 and 2 and love them! I loaded up the CDs and made new sets in FontExplorer and
  imported all the gratis fonts provided, noticing that there are duplicates of some
  fonts and not of others. I've got a vague idea of why there are Post-Script and
  TrueType included but I want to know for sure. I'm pretty sure Post-Script are 'printer'
  fonts and TrueType are the 'screen' fonts. Is this correct? Which one do I enable
  when I want to use the font? or do I enable both?\r\n\r\nMaybe this is better directed
  towards Paul or someone at P22 but the 'Screwtop' family I imported is empty. Info
  on the Family in FontExplorer says it contains 0 characters. :-("

    general, this is pretty easy to spot. Given that they were well designed, true
    SC are better proportioned and have the same weight (e.g. aproximately the same
    stem width) as lowercase characters. If you're not sure, print out a passage of
    text with some embedded words typeset in SC and you'll see the difference. If
    you don't want to print and are using InDesign, just open the Glyph Palette and
    visually check for the presence of SC.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>I\u2019m pretty sure Post-Script
    are \u2018printer\u2019 fonts and TrueType are the \u2018screen\u2019 fonts. Is

    related myths be wiped from the planet? :^/ :^) Please read: <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/16695\">TrueType
    versus PostScript</a>"

    \r\n\r\nI believe it is generally the other way around: making the stems bolder
    and trying to keep the counters similar makes the small caps wider. Eg. I just
    checked Adobe Garamond, which has it this way--wider not narrower."

  body: Regarding InDesign...if they're OpenType do the brackets around the styles
    mean they're not included? I just checked Adobe Jenson Pro and it had brackets
    around Swashes and Contextual Alternates. When you are talking wider/narrower,
    are you talking about a cap and SC set in the same point size? I just checked
    SC in Adobe Jenson Pro and I'm pretty sure they were narrower.

    to make a conclusion?\r\nI would easily say that the area SC glyphs occupy is
    generally more \"squarish\". (I guess I'm agreeing with them being wider tho)"

  body: Oh, right...when you scale the SC up to the same cap height as the reg cap
    letters it definitely is wider. I just wish they would get rid of faux buttons
    and disable/bracket options if it's not available in the font in the regular styles
    menu, not just for OT examples.

    I also just looked closer in FontExplorer and if you doubleclick a font and go
    to Characters it lists all characters....that's probably the easiest way to see
    if it has SC before loading it up. This is why I piled 3 questions into one because
    I knew it would be more obvious than it seems. Now I need to get them to use FontExplorer
    instead of FontBook on the workstations."
