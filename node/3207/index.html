  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hooray for my first post. As I am reading through the forums I am truly honored by the amount of talented people there are on this site. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am a student currently working on a theoretical type project based on the idea of truth. The basis is derived from the idea of vocal pattern truth recognition that is being used in fields like airport security. My goal is to create a typeface for screen applications(TV/Closed captioning is my first goal)that analyzes the vocal patterns of a speaker and determines the truth of their words and will alter the type if lies are told. Think a lie detector that a television viewer can turn on to determine whether any of the words spoken by Bush are true. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I will be building a full character set with UC and lc which is kind of a new thing for captioning. They use lc but sparingly. I want to do this because I think that the lc has the possibilities for more variations. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am pretty solid about my idea's focus and it's potential benefits, but I am very nervous since my knowledge of building typefaces for screen is more limited than my knowledge for print(which is beginner also).  So when I pose questions don't assume that anything is obvious please.  I would really like to understand the ideas behind legible screen fonts and make my project a success. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since I am building an original typeface that is bound for the  screen should I design it as an outline first, then translate it to screen/pixel whatever? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If I am designing the type and its structural variations with HDTV(1920 x 1080 res.)in mind, is the process different for building a typeface from that resolution vs. a standard TV we used today?  How and why are good here also. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My money, time and resources are limited since it is a school project.  What should I be looking at to create this? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any others words would be greatly appreciated if you can help me with this?  Sometimes it easier for me to answer and understand than pose and wait. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->jp <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was looking in depth at the basic construction of a bitmap font and wanted to know more about the correaltion between the size of the squares used for example by Silkscreen (which is only used optimally at 8 pt) and its .014 in. square that  builds the form. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Looking at my options and the time I have my approach will probably take this course.  Using a set grid, design a screen-based font that will have a set base alphabet and at least one parallel-varied set that shows the effects of untruthful statements with a varying line width,  extended stems, enlarge counters, etc&hellip;  It probably will not be optimal to read at the size needed for a closed captioning system, but I hope my main idea will still come across. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Maybe in the future I can extend the family and incorporate more of the research into it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any other encouraging information is welcome though if you feel I can accomplish the fuller idea or verison of it in a smaller time frame. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->josh</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are two main kinds of bitmap fonts: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) &quot;True&quot; bitmap fonts where the actual pixel data is defined in bits. These are either stand-alone (like in the FON format) or embedded (in a TT font). These fonts only show up when their pre-defined pixel height is chosen. True bitmap fonts have unfortunately become second-class citizens in terms of support, especially on MacOS. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Pixelfonts (like Silkscreen), which are basically outline fonts that can be used at any point size, but which map out the correct bitmap data only when a certain point size is chosen. Pixelfonts have robust support, because the OS doesn't know the difference. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In a pixelfont the point size you need to use to make the bitmap come out right depends on the ratio of the outline pixel squares to the em size of the font. For example if you fix the target point size to 8 and make the &quot;pixels&quot; 125 em units square, you can build a bitmap font of any vertical span you want and it'll come out right when the font is set to 8 point. This might seem counter-intuitive, but it avoids the user having to fish around for the right point size that will make the font snap into place. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">For 20 pixels high defining em &amp; pixel sizes that map to 8 point is probably a bad idea, because your outlines would go more than twice over the vertical limit.

Your calculations assume a UPM size of 1000.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The whole trick of the size of the grid (i.e. &quot;vector pixels&quot;) is:  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One side: At 72 dpi, the point size that you require is equal the ppem size of the font, i.e. the number of pixels that the emsquare will consist of, e.g. 8.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other side: Your font's emsquare is built of a certain amount of of units, typically 1000. So we speak of 1000 UPM (units per em).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Since 8 pixels correspond to 1000 units, 1 pixel corresponds to 1000/8 = 125 units. This is really simple math.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, note that if you use FontLab to create a font in TrueType format, you will be able to choose any number as your UPM size. Therefore, you can as easily set your UPM size to 800 and target for a 8 pixels type size, so that one pixel corresponds to 800/8 = 100 units.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Similarly, if you target a 20 pixels type size, you can use a UPM 1000 and then one pixel will correspond to 1000/20 = 50 units, but you can also use a UPM 200 and then one pixel will correspond to 200/20 = 10, or a UPM 2000 and then 2000/20 = 100.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Keeping this in mind, you will be able to easily target &quot;untypical&quot; font sizes such as 13 pixels.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Adam Twardoch <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fontlab Ltd.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">(Wow, I am going to break my &quot;never reply to Hrant&quot; rule for the first time in months.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's not true. Type 1 (and OpenType CFF) fonts can be built at any em scale, as long as all points and metrics are within +/- 4096 units. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Additionally, specifying size in points for a font intended to be used on screen is meaningless, unless the output device is also defined. There's a good reason folks developing screen fonts talk about size in ppem (pixels per em). This does correspond to points in classical Mac-speak, but the conversion from ppem to points involves multiplying by 3/4 for classical Windows-speak. That is to say, 12 ppem equals 12 point on Mac, but 9 point on Windows. If you want to optimize something for &quot;12 point display&quot; on both Mac and Windows, you need to optimize both the 12 and 16 ppem sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>
