  while i'm there, any tips? I'm interested in books on typography and design, especially
  out-of-print classics. Tips on great books to pick up are also appreciated!

  body: Go to Charing Cross Road. You'll find a few book shops with old titles. I
    bought "Printing Types", Updike, 2nd edition. Happy! Tried to find "Essay on Typography",
    but with no success, only the facsimile. Good fishing!

  body: "It would be worth checking out [[http://www.allinlondon.co.uk/directory/1277/3340.php|Collinge
    & Clark]] in Bloomsbury. They have an excellent selection of old specimens and
    type books. They're usually closed on weekends, but their schedule is a bit erratic,
    so you never know.\r\n\r\nAnd it's a shame you won't be in town the following
    weekend, when the [[http://ephemera-society.org.uk|Ephemera Society]] has one
    of their big fairs. Those are an absolute treasure trove!"

  body: "Superb, thanks a lot! i'll check those out. I'm staying until tuesday, so
    i'll have time to look into Collinge and Clarke too. \r\n\r\nI read somewhere
    that both Foyles and Maggs have typography books, anyone know anything about them?
    How about Zwemmers? Foyles is pretty famous i gather, but i'm totally blank when
    it comes to London shops. Harrods who?"

  body: "Foyles are good for current publications and often have recently out-of-print
    titles but won't have anything especially rare. They are a very big store with
    well-stocked departments on most subjects, and a very nice neon sign which I think
    dates from the 1930s.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.maggs.com/|Maggs]] are a specialist
    antiquarian dealer.\r\n\r\nSadly I don't think Zwemmers have any stores left in
    London."

    checking out Collinge and Clarke, i looked it up on Wikipedia and found that it's
    the store from \u201CBlack Books\u201D \u2013 which my girlfriend recently bought
    the entire series of on dvd. Now she's got a reason to come with me to look at
    musty old type books! Yay!"

    comedy series. The interior scenes, though, were shot in a studio. The real Collinge
    & Clarke interior is very small and cramped. But consider yourself fortunate that
    the booksellers have quit smoking: one used to need a gas mask when visiting the
    shop.'

    of the interior of the fictional shop were modelled on Collinge & Clarke but made
    much larger.\r\n\r\nJust around the corner from C&C on Marchmont street is Judd
    Books, which is sometimes a good source for remaindered books on type."
