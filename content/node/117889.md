  this image in a book about Paul Renner, the caption reads 'S\xFCtterlin-Schrift,
  a model for children's handwriting in use in Germany in the early 1920s.' We found
  out S\xFCtterlin-Schrift is a handwriting style rather than the name of the typeface.
  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what the name of the typeface is? Has it ever been digitalised?
  Is there a similar font in existence? \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance."

    The _R_ has beautiful balance and is easy to hand write. Same goes for the numbers.
    BTW note the _1_ which resembles a _7_ to modern typeface conditioned eyes. This
    is the common way the number was hand written and was not used in standard typefaces.

  body: "I've got a great fondness for school primer lettering. In trying to teach
    children what, exactly, a letter looks like we're in effect attempting to reduce
    it to its platonic essence as a great, didactic project of modernism. It's a handwriting-based
    approach that's quite the opposite of the chirographic one: instead of trying
    to fill type with the ductus of a professional lettering artist, it's trying to
    instil perfect regularity in the most childlike of simple writing styles.\r\n\r\nOften
    it can be naive and clumsy, granted, but the best stuff is brilliant. For instance:
    The [[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E8ckEeMgiOU/UJpGarpLiYI/AAAAAAAAFRg/Rioer39LlmY/s400/3401114503_457fdb835c.jpg|\"S\xD6-style\"]]
    of semi-connected script taught in Sweden for about a decade in the 70s (as designed
    by lettering artist Kerstin Anckers) is marvellously legible."

  body: "Johan, I don't want to encourage an extended discussion of issues that are
    unrelated to the [presumably] Renner letters, but I can't help but ask for a brief
    explanation of why, if the  \"S\xD6-style\" of semi-connected script was so good,
    it was used only for a decade in the 1970's. Was it because of a wish to purge
    cursive writing from the teaching model? New focus on keyboarding?\r\nDon"

  body: "Quite the reverse: after extensive protests from traditionalists who constantly
    fought to undermine it, the teaching of cursive went back to 19th-century forms.
    When I was a child in the mid-eighties that's what we learnt and the S\xD6 style
    was purged from history. (The S\xD6 style was also apparently impractical to teach
    and hard to write for small children. But it *looks* nice.) :)\r\n\r\nOkay, hijack
    over. The Renner (or whoever) primer lettering is lovely, someone sould digitize
    indeed."
