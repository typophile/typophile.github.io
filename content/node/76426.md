body: "ok, so...I am writing an article on\r\n<strong>Anthropomorphism & Zoomorphism
  of Typography</strong>\r\nI have a loose outline with some themes & concepts I'd
  like to touch on. \r\nI want to get some feedback, good & bad.\r\nHere is what I
  have.\r\n\r\n   \"The next time you are choosing a font for a project or even if
  you are considering the next font you'd like to sketch and eventually develop, consider
  the anthropomorphic qualities of your characters.\r\n\r\nAnthropomorphism is the
  implication and application of human characteristics applied to a tangible object,
  theme or ideal.\r\nZoomorphism: the implication and application of animal characteristics
  applied to a tangible object, theme or ideal.\r\n\r\nMost copy text is intended
  to be gender neutral and have a welcoming, calming effect. If you are going to read
  a book, an essay or even several length paragraphs, you do not want to be bombarded
  with masculinity that hinders legibility or with swashes and femininity that distracts
  from the content: the message of the text.\r\nFor instance Centaur, an old style
  serif typeface, designed by Bruce Rogers, is a formal but inviting font: welcoming
  you to read the text.\r\n\r\nNotice the x-height, swashes, serifs, tails, counters.
  Does the typeface strike you with a gender? High ascenders (and low descenders)
  lean towards femininity and low ascenders (and high descenders) have a quieter,
  more masculine voice.\r\n...\r\nA blacklister typeface is very harsh with its calligraphic
  angles... (mentioning something of this being manly and bordering on angry: the
  far end of playful or childlike)\r\n...\r\nIf the font is ambiguous to gender or
  mood, can you determine an associated animalistic quality? Do you see a distinct
  elephant trunk, giraffe neck, monkey tail, platypus bill?\r\n\r\nZoomorphism is
  ubiquitous in illustrated manuscripts. The Book of Kells contains initial capitals
  that are snakes and peacocks. This might be more illustrious that characteristic
  of the letterforms but the concept is rich in the text & images.\r\n...\r\n\r\nThere
  are reasons we use terms like <em>arm, shoulder, spine & ear</em>.\" \r\n\r\n   References...\r\nfeminine
  typefaces \r\nCoquette, Mark Simonson\r\nButtermilk. Jessica Hische\r\nBree, TypeTogether\r\nLiza,
  Underware\r\n\r\nmasculine\r\nCentury Schoolbook, Linn Boyd Benton\r\nEurostile,
  Aldo Novarese\r\nForza, H&FJ\r\nRockwell, Monotype\r\n\r\nWhat do you think can
  be added or subtracted from this to make it a richer, clearer article? Any fonts
  that are distinctly a specific animal or contain anatomic elements of an animal?
  Additional thoughts?\r\n\r\nI'd also like to know why Matthew Carter named a font
  Elephant. When I think of the animal, I see a very low contrast creature (in terms
  of weight) with a stout torso and tree trunks for legs; when I see the font [Elephant],
  I see a very high contrast font with the ball terminals and hairline shoulders,
  etc. This might be too far from the rest of the post. Carter is also a hero of mine,
  so I don't mean the question with ill intent.\r\n\r\nThank you, sorry this is lengthy
  post."

    believe Carter had in mind one of the names of a paper size in the old imperial
    naming system (which would have been in prevalent use during the period from which
    this style of type comes), not necessarily the animal, per se. \r\n\r\nCarter's
    design is based on a Five Lines Pica face, which is a pretty large size, by Vincent
    Figgins. And Elephant was a good-sized paper stock (~ 23 x 28 inches). Seems to
    be a nice resonance there. \r\n\r\nBut I might be completely off base. I could
    try to confirm that supposition with him. "

  body: Ascribing analagous moods and personalities to the qualities of a typeface
    is natural, and they way we do it is worth exploring. But I would back away from
    the focus on gender. There are too many steps in the folly of associating type
    with a gender, because it requires you first to have an idea of what human qualities
    you think are masculine or feminine, and in this enlightened age, the social construct
    of gender essentialism is just about too weak to convincingly apply to real human
    beings, let alone stretch to type. Any attempt to justify your conclusions puts
    you at risk of throwing your lot in with the evo-psychs.

    typography can change the way a typeface \xABacts\xBB on paper a lot. But you
    can only work against so much; type is not invisible. If you cast a stubbly actor
    in a female part he's still not going to look like a woman, even if you make him
    sing really high. \r\n\r\n<cite>\"the social construct of gender essentialism

    and fascinating. If scientists can investigate what sort of typefaces laymen perceive
    as \xABfriendly\xBB, \xABauthoritative\xBB, &c then why not masculine & feminine?
    I'd warn against backing off from looking at how we perceive, ascribe, construct
    gender just because some will tell you it's either not PC, or not \xABscientifically
    sound\xBB. Just be sure to view this <em>construction</em> of gender-specifics
    as largely dependent on reflection in a given cultural context, not of course
    as something inherent to the shapes themselves.\r\n(Actually, has anybody done
    any work on this: Investigating what sort of shapes would generally be perceived
    as masculine vs. feminine in the [Latin] West vs. in other cultures?)"

    this was because of a lack of information, writings, essays, editorials on the
    issue.\r\nI am looking at the anatomical construct of the human for when addressing
    gender, not any sort of stereotype or shallow material.\r\nWe use words to ascribe
    attributes to distinguish male and female and the words we use can also be attributed
    to typefaces, whether we know it, like it or not. The gender issue was intended
    to be set back from the foreground issue of assigning animalistic characteristics
    to type: a much more faceted was of assessing type (than gender).\r\n\r\nI don't
    want to continue the idea, however, it is viewed as \"complete nonsense\""

  body: "I believe we do that kind of association a lot. Sometimes in an intuitive
    way. Although vulnerable to context, we tend to associate shapes iconically. Do
    you think, for instance, that swash caps and the elegance of italics can be linked
    more rapidly to a masculine shape or a feminin curve? On the other hand, and giving
    some support to Nick's point of view, a rude black-weighted sans-serif can be
    imagined as being injected with testosterone, but what happens if it is put in
    a pink background, with some flowers? It reminds me of typography as it is, or
    as it should be: typefaces are not the only criteria of selection when working
    with text. Do you think it makes sense to put a man in a art nail context, or
    a lion swimming with dolphins? Context does matter. If we are talking about Rennaissance,
    Bembo would be a natural choice, but what if the intention is contrast? Things
    should be seen as a whole, with a purpose, in a context, don\xB4t you think?"

  body: "going back to what Nick said (its stuck in my brain recently), I think the
    decisions made on casting those actors to fill those roles is where my interest
    lies. <em>Why</em> was Aphrodite [Slim] Pro chosen to advertise women's clothing
    in the place of H&FJ's Forza? What if we saw Forza advertising My Little Pony?
    and Buttermilk or Candy Script advertising Gillette razors (for men)?\r\nAll of
    this shows the typographer in question didn't do his research on the company and
    audience: he didn't cast the actors in the proper role <em>because</em> each of
    those typefaces has a personality and characteristics that make them look so out
    of place in those instances. \r\nYou cannot cast a fragile, elderly man in the
    role of a HotWheels advertisement, a small boy needs to push those cars along
    to sell it to other small boys.\r\nIn this way, there are animalistic qualities
    we can recognize (if subconsciously) in typefaces as well.\r\n\r\nInstead of viewing
    typefaces that are in a state of functionality and saying that this thesis doesn't
    hold water, I think I am trying to communicate that we should view fonts in a
    vacuum of black and white and then proceed to apply them to the correct scenarios
    and <em>why</em> we chose that font for that role.\r\n\r\nThe topic of zoomorphism
    carries the same weight but might be harder to distinguish, personally. Hence,
    why I wanted to introduce that idea. What characteristics, within a typeface,
    tangible or intangible, visually describe to us a specific archetypal creature
    based on innate notions? I can't quite clarify this anymore, for this thread or
    for myself, thats where I am looking for a little direction.\r\n\r\nI hope that
    clears up some of the of lack of clarity of my initial post."

    <strong>Anthropomorphism, Zoomorphism & Phytomorphism in Typography</strong>.\r\n\r\nNow,
    not to get completely lost in an early stage of your research, I would suggest
