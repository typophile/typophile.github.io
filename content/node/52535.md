  hosting server Bluehost.\r\nThe server is down too frequently and I am not happy
  with the tech. support.\r\n\r\nIs there anybody happy here with his hosting service?
  Can you recommend me one? \r\n\r\nI am specially thinking of people who make an
  extensive use of his server and have a webshop, use databases, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    for about five years, and have been extremely happy with them. They use an interesting
    pay-as-you-go setup for hosting, so you pay only for the actual services you use
    on a day to day basis. Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I've not had any
    problems.\r\n\r\nTake it easy,\r\n\r\nAndi\r\n\r\n[<a href='http://www.semibad.com'>semibad</a>]"
