  body: Really soft transitions on this serif font.  Thought I would be able to match
    it easily, but is proving elusive.

  body: yes, but the R in particular is pretty strange, and the points are thinner
    in general.  Any idea what sort it might be?  Book is from 1950

  body: "> Book is from 1950\r\n\r\nIn that case expect this to be hand-drawn and
    not following strictly a particular typeface. I think you see slight differences
    when you compare the same letters at different sizes."
