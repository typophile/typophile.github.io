body: "Trying to do the logotype for a realty brand. Was looking at this classy, upmarket,
  clean sort of highbrow look for the brand. Colours like Golds and Blacks and some
  combinations of yellowish greys.\r\n\r\nFirst I felt that the typeface choice might
  influence the feel more than the logo. After going through some type choices like
  a still at school designer, I thought of using bodoni with some good amount of tracking
  and nicely pairing it with helvetica nueue for subtext.\r\n\r\nBut as I went on
  with the process of designing the logo I felt this was a bad move, should have maybe
  designed the logo first and then type. My three logo options came out fairly geometric
  and clean cut and suddenly I couldn't see bodoni being paired with that. (Options
  had strong rectangular feel, one is like a cuboid, another one a very ladder like
  feel.)\r\n\r\nSo I shifted my attention to some good clean looking sans serifs,
  the only typeface that seems to fit was Gotham ( Maybe Telefon too but I didn't
  like the characteristic E for this particular task ). Another typeface I really
  like is Brandon Grotesque and thought it might work too. Comparing these I feel
  G0tham might do a better job because it seemed sharper, but it is so overused right
  now. The sensible part of me says I should go with something that seems to suit
  the work, another part of says that using something that is everywhere doesn't really
  set the brand as apart. On the other hand Brandon Grotesque is \"in\". sort of.
  SO can't decide again.\r\n\r\nCan't seem to decide, Help on this sort of a thing?\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I know the brand attributes I have given might come off as very subjective, but
  that's the generic description I could come up with. Also, how do you get that high
  brow, clean, premium look using Sans serif typefaces. Lets assume I pick a geometric
  sans serif for the main brand/logo what family of typefaces would make for some
  good collateral text. Tips, thoughts, Feedback, critique of my views will be very
  very helpful.\r\n\r\nAlso started looking at Neutraface as an option. "

    out of the picture...\r\n\r\nTelefon might be a good choice. Get them to change
    the \"E\" for you (probably for a fee). I'll ping them.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, a
    monoline sans is not \"classy\", unless maybe it's narrow. You need contrast and/or
    serifs for that. What about something like this?\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andrijtype/seaside/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I agree that for your objectives a high-contrast or thick and thin sans like
    Seaside might work very well. Search using these terms and you will find some
    more in this vein. BTW this style, in the lighter weights,  has been used for
    upmarket logo designs in France for many years. \r\nDon"

  body: "I disagree with the idea that a monoline sans cannot be classy. It easily
    can, in any weight. It's about spacing. Generous spacing (either around the word
    mark/logo or within it) consistently suggests 'premium' or 'class'. Telefon, Gotham,
    Neutra are all good options. Personally, I would pick Telefon out of that bunch
    because it is not as common in my neck of the woods (Australia) but ubiquity should
    not be a major design consideration IMO unless you know that competitors of the
    company are using those faces. Let your symbol also continue to guide you. \r\n\r\nIf
    you are really worried about the monoline sans thing, then I'd suggest a 'flared'
    type might do the trick. Trajan Sans Pro is lovely and super classy for example."

  body: "Thanks for the inputs everyone. While I like Sye feel that geometric monoline
    sans can give a good classy look if one handles the tracking/kerning the right
    way, pretty sure hhp has some reasons to believe what he does too. Personally
    have an aversion to the look of seaside with the kind of mindset I am in with
    this project.  Any more knowledge in terms of general practices when setting type
    and making typeface choices in this sort of a case would be helpful too. \r\n\r\nAlso
    what family of typefaces or typeface examples would work nicely with geometric
    typefaces and could be general guidance, in things like business cards etc. I
    am currently considering Meta, Helvetica Neue or Flama might work out as good
    pairing options for lets say logotype subtext or even in business cards. \r\n\r\nGeneral
    and specific guidelines that help sort out and define an approach to such problems
    ? Besides experience and habit obviously.\r\n\r\nAlso Frode (Edit: Frodo), man
    that's really great, If I finally end up choosing Telefon, I will be surely contacting
    you on this. Great to know that some people still work with heart."

  body: In terms of pairing, or supporting types, I tend to look for something that
    contrasts with the main type. It's the difference that creates the visual energy.
    IMO.
