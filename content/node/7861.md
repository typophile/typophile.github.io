body: Dear Scott Keawekane, Raja Sandhu, Hrant H Papazian, Thomas Lippl, John B.,
  darrel, Chris Rugen, and Sharon Brunson; <BR>I wanna thank you all again for all
  your comments in my first version of this discussion. Attached is the exploration
  and probably final direction of my typeface at the bottom. Except for the first
  one which is based on the logo of Amaru Entertainments and the cross on 2pac&#39;s
  back, all the others are based on the two sides of him. Masculine/feminine, rough/gentle,
  bold/delicate basically the yin &amp; Yang side of him. Let me know what you think
  about it, and since i already promised I will update u with my progress, I had to
  keep it. <BR> <BR>Always, <BR>Tseggai<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/54397.jpg"

  body: 'To me #3 is cute &#40;that &#34;e&#34; is genial!&#41; but #4, especially
    in that &#34;scuffed&#34; rendering is really quite nice - it would sell&#42;
    well, I&#39;m sure of it. BTW, it reminds me of Zentra&#42;&#42;, but that was
    a lot less legible.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42; If you&#39;re looking for a font house
    to sell it through, I would recommend PsyOps. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; <a href="http://www.tdc.org/news/2001Results/Zentra.html"

  body: 'From a purely visual standpoint, I really like #4. For whatever reason, #1
    feels the most connected to Shakur &#40;probably because most of what I see connected
    with him now is posthumous&#41;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be interested to see some words
    set in #4. I&#39;m also curious to see if the &#39;c&#39; would read well. My
    brain turns it into an &#39;r&#39;. <BR> <BR>Cool stuff. What&#39;s the reaction
    in your class?'

  body: Harant, thanks for the tips. Especially about selling it. I never thought
    of it. The project includes the design of a poster to sell it, and information
    panel or booklet and a t-shirt. All my classmates do superb design job, but they
    still had the time to appreciate. My professor seems to not know about 2-pac,
    so i gave him &#34;tupac resurection&#34; and &#34;2pac 4ever&#34; dvd&#39;s to
    know him better. I sitill got to do same for some of the classmates and the rest
    of the professors who will be in the board. Chris, thanks for the tip on &#34;C&#34;.
    I&#39;ll try to flip it vertically and see. I&#39;ll keep bringing the latest
    updates on it. <BR> <BR>Tseggai

  body: 'I like #1 as well, for the reasons Chris mentioned. However, it seems TOO
    clean. Looking at his tattoos, they were all amateurish needle-and-india-ink hack
    jobs. I think that handcrafted look might be &#34;more&#34; authentic. Overall
    I think the typefaces you&#39;ve posted here are too &#34;techno.&#34; <BR> <BR>But
    again, I like #1 a lot, except that I think you should make the T more dramatic
    and oversized, like the S. <BR> <BR>Good luck!'
