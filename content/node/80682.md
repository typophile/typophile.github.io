body: I was browsing today in the bookstore in Grand Centran Station, New York, when
  a magazine leapt out at me. A stylish fashion mag from Sweden, called Bon had a
  masthead that was very familiar. It used a typeface (Garbo) that I designed for
  Mecanorma in 1975, when I was a student. The font was discontinued some years back
  and sadly I've no reference of the entire font. Over the years I've seen Garbo used
  on everything from neon brasseries signage in Paris to ice cream parlours in Phuket,
  but I think Bon make it look pretty cool.
