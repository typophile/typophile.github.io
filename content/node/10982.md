body: It almost looks like trajan bold on the caps. I love the look of the font. I
  don&#39;t know if they have mixed fonts, but even so I want to know the lowercase
  font. Thanks all! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8785.gif"

  body: I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this is custom. VS has used  <BR>Trajan caps
    for quite a while, and they might conceivably  <BR>have commissioned a lowercase
    to go with them. <BR> <BR>It strikes me that this lowercase could have been  <BR>done
    by the Hoefler Type Foundry. It bears a passing  <BR>resemblance to custom work
    that both JH and TF-J  <BR>have done before -- like Jonathan&#39;s type for <i>House  <BR>&amp;
    Garden</i> or Tobias&#39;s MSL Elzevir. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR> <BR>

  body: From what I can find as well, I would have to agree with <BR>Kent. That &#39;W&#39;
    is definitely more <i>Minion</i>, than  <BR><i>Garamond</i>. MM Minion comes semi-close,
    but Elzevir and  <BR>MSL Elzevir &#40;so I&#39;ve been told recently&#41; ;^&#41;
    don&#39;t match. The  <BR>reason I would say it is custom is because the characters  <BR>aren&#39;t
    following the same school of thought. Specifically, the  <BR>&#39;T&#39; and the
    &#39;W&#39;. <BR>

  body: Tom, stop posting these difficult-to-ID fonts, dude. You&#39;re a nightmare
    to both our statistics and our reputation. Ask some easy ones so you can make
    us look good, dammit! ;&#41; <BR> <BR>And why are you so obsessed with lingerie
    catalogs, you perv! =D

  body: Minion and Bembo are both close for the lower case, so it seems to be an Aldine
    of some type.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=aldine&amp;itemsperpage=14&amp;resultcount=14&amp;page=1"

    <BR> <BR>Aetna JY Newstyle Roman is close too, but not quite it either &#40;the
    lc &#34;r&#34; is way off&#41;. <BR> <BR>David

  body: I really wanted to know the answer on this one. Wouldn&#39;t someone release
    the font even if it is custom. Well....you all should recreate it. I someone on
    this board wants to =&#41; <BR> <BR>So is it agreed it is custom--because I hate
    that answer. They should relase a Trajan lowercase. Seems logical.

  body: I understand your frustration with unavailability, Tom. <BR>Often a company
    will commission a proprietary font, so  <BR>they know they&#39;ll be the only
    org to use it - making it <BR>part of their identity. This is not uncommon.

  body: BTW, <a href="http://typographi.ca/000129.php" target="_blank">Someone has</a>
    tried to do a Trajan lowercase,   <BR>but this Victoria&#39;s Secret thing is
    definitely superior <BR>&#40;not that a Trajan was really their intention - it
    just <BR>shares some of the same characteristics&#41;.
