body: "I need some help identifying the typeface which the book's title\u2014'Woods
  beyond a cornfield-is set in. The book was printed by hand letterpress in London,
  in 1979 and I know the printer-publisher used mainly Monotype or special Foundry
  typefaces. Any help (and info on the typeface if possible) would be GREATLY appreciated!
  Thanks in advance!"

  body: "Thanks very much! There's nothing on the colophon. But I put Gerald's and
    Cromy's comments together and managed to figure it out. There's no 'Bold Face
    Outline' but this did ring a bell with an article I read on the publisher a while
    ago. Cromy's clue provided the final link - I managed to unearth a copy of the
    Monotype Printing Types Specimen Book. The type in question is Monotype Old Style
    Bold Outline 176. See image attached with great many thanks for all the help!
