  body: "Very hard to tell with the small sample. It looks a bit like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/keedy-sans-ot/|Keedy
    Sans]], although I'm not sure that's right.\r\n\r\nSomething funny going on with
    the first two letters as well; they both look different to the remaining characters."

  body: agree with Lima, very small to see the characters well. Century Gothic?
