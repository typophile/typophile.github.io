  body: "The third one is <strong>[[http://www.linotype.com/433109/WiccanStdSansIntReg-product.html|Wiccan
    Sans]]</strong> by Comicraft Design (probably a bit manually condensed)\r\nTry
    both lower and capital letters e.g.: \"La trampa no es lo que...\" to find the
    best natch \r\n(lower & capital letters on this font, actually produce variations
    of capitals)"
