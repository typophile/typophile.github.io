    You see them used in Germany quite a bit, but not so much elsewhere. One brand
    name of the actual stapler is Ring King. Here's a link\u2014only in German, but
    you can get the drift.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bewerbungsmappen.de/Praesentationsmappen/RingKing/ringking.html\r\n\r\nLinda"

    booklets binder compatible without resorting to drilling.
