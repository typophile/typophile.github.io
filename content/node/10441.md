  body: Yes, laser prints almost always give slightly thicker letters, so that might
    be why you find the display version a little bit nicer. But what you also have
    to take into account is the quality of the final offset printing. Are you using
    a coated stock? What resolution are you printing at? Computer-to-plate? There
    are so many variables. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re using a really high quality coated
    stock, printing at 3000&#43; dpi, computer-to-plate. You might find the display
    version of Minion too light and contrasty. <BR> <BR>K.

  body: 'Thanks, Keith. I guess I need guidance from the printer. The paper will not
    be coated, at least if I have a say. Overall, I&#39;m surprised that there isn&#39;t
    more discussion of and guidance, eg. from Adobe, on when to use what weights,
    especially given that they are now doing the &#39;opticals&#39;. To me, the digital
    versions of typefaces should be just as sensitive to the changes in size as were
    the original foundry type, and the typeface developer should give guidance to
    graphic artists on how to use them. '

  body: Also, if the regular weight looks too closely set in 11 point, but not in
    10 point -- which seems counter-intuitive to me --  then I wonder if your printer&#39;s
    RIP might not be playing tricks on you. If it is not a true Adobe Postscript RIP,
    then it may not be correctly interpreting hints. <BR> <BR>There are several versions
    of Minion. The regular Type 1 fonts, which were released initially &#40;and which
    it sounds like you are using&#41; were revised when the family was released as
    a Multiple Master set. As I understand it, Robert completely refitted the fonts
    in addition to tweaking some of the outlines. The MM fonts have an optical axis
    and allow greater range than the initial release. <BR> <BR>I believe that the
    OT Pro series has been further tweaked. The OT opticals are labelled to indicate
    the intended use -- Caption for the smallest sizes, Text for normal text sizes,
    Subhead for the mid-range, and Display for headline and on up. I don&#39;t know
    if a layout feature has been implemented to automatically pull the outlines for
    the designated point size. <BR> <BR>Personally I prefer the MM versions because
    they provide the greatest flexibility in matching the grading to the output. <BR>

    an indication of the specific sizes they are meant to be used at. <BR> <BR>K.'

    In your case, I would definitely not make judgements about the display versus
    the regular grades of Minion based on your laser output. I would rely instead
    on printed examples, especially if I could find specimens printed under similar
    circumstances as my target. <BR> <BR>The choice to purchase the MM fonts is entirely
    yours and budget will necessarily be a factor. Adobe will not be creating any
    more MM fonts, but I still find the existing ones invaluable. In the event that
    MM becomes unsupported, one can always generate instances as regular Type 1 fonts.
    <BR> <BR>That said, the regular release fonts look just fine, they just aren&#39;t
    as flexible in terms of fine-tuning &#151; but we&#146;re talking about being
    pretty darn picky here. <BR> <BR>Hrant, I tend to agree more with your divisions.

  body: 'I wholeheartedly agree that MM technology is great, and all things being

    Slimbach made on Minion Pro resulted in a much nicer face, especially in the display
    cuts.  <BR> <BR>Adobe&#39;s site says that the Minion character set supports:  <BR>&#34;ISO-Adobe
    2, Adobe CE, Greek, Cyrillic, Latin Extended &#34;. That makes it pretty useful....And:

  body: Yes, when I checked Abobe, they weren&#39;t selling the MM Minion font. If,
    John and Kent say, Slimbach adjusted Minion several times, it may be that what
    I found problematic, he did as well. In any case, it looks like I need to spring
    for the &#39;Pro&#39; version to be confident about the result. <BR> <BR>As to
    the sizes of the different regular and optical fonts, to me sometimes a font will
    look good at 10 point but not at 12 or visa versa. Maybe I am crazy about this,
    but I think something objective is going on. For example with Adobe Garamond I
    did some booklets that were printed in 12 point and looked great. But I think
    at 10 point, Adobe Garamond, with its small x-height doesn&#39;t work so well.
    But I find similar things with explanations I can&#39;t come up with.  <BR> <BR>To
    me, one of the things about great typefaces like Goudy or Palatino or Times is
    that you can feel the look of the typeface on the page without looking at individual
    characters. But I have seen for example Palatino looking really elegant or clumsy.
    Maybe this is just graphic designers knowing how to us them, but I think sizes
    and weights that work best is also part of the story.

  body: It&#39;s too bad that you can&#39;t still buy the MM fonts, even if they aren&#39;t
    supporting them or making more. <BR> <BR>I agree that some typefaces will look
    good at one size but not a point or two smaller or larger. The thing that I found
    unusual was that you felt Minion was too closely set at 11 point, but not at 10
    point. Generally speaking, the smaller the point size, the looser the fit should
    be; so if a font looks too closely fitted at one size, I would expect it to look
    even more so when set smaller. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: BTW, I see that the Kepler MM fonts are still available. Presumably Adobe
    will soon be releasing OT opticals of this face as well. I am sure that for most
    users who even care about optical designs, the current OT optical range is quite
    adequate. But for those who want maximum flexibility, you might consider getting
    these fonts before there gone. Kepler is a very friendly and versatile Modern/Didone
    design. I&#39;ve enjoyed using it several times. <BR> <BR>The potential downside
    is that direct support for MM at the app and system level may disappear &#40;I
    seem to recall something about future versions of ATM dropping MM support&#41;
    so you may need to be comfortable with getting under the hood and generating instances
    as Type 1 for them to continue to be useful into the future. <BR> <BR>-- K.

  body: Kent, maybe I was analyzing it wrongly. Maybe what looks better is the weight
    of the letters. The darker letters seem to look better at smaller sizes. I am
    relieved to hear from you that it is not just my insanity to think that a point
    or two makes a difference in how welcoming and readable a given typeface design
    is!

    old Minion, I found that the Pro regular is actually slimmed down, looks better
    and sets narrower - almost identical to the old Display minion in setting, but
    a bit darker. My old problems with it are largely overcome in the new version.  <BR>
