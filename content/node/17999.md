  body: "Thanks everyone, \r\n\r\nI\u2019m gonna go to FF Cocon, which I was going
    to get before and now it\u2019s a good excuse to do it.\r\n\r\nAlso, in regards
    to GE Inspira, after looking closely at GE site and some GE product PDFs I can
    only see about 4 weights (Regular, Regular Italic, Bold, Bold Italic). 90% of
    design is set in Regular weight, which seems a little too thin (which doesn\u2019t
    work very well in small size or negative space) and Bold is a pretty heavy. I
    think they\u2019ll need a Semibold pretty soon\u2026\r\n"
