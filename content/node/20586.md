body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Designers]] : Franko Luin</strong>\r\n\r\nBorn to Slovenian
  parents in Trieste, [[Italy]], in 1941, Frank Luin immigrated to [[Sweden]] in 1961.
  He died in Tyres\xF6 on September 15, 2005, at the age of 64.\r\n\r\nAfter studying
  at the Grafiska Institutet during the 1960s, Franko Luin spent two decades honing
  his skills as a print designer for Ericsson before branching out on his own. He
  spent much of the 1990s perusing two passions: multimedia and typeface design. In
  1996, he founded his own typographic studio, [[Omnibus Typografi]]. That same year,
  [[Linotype]] began distributing his fonts, which rank among the 20th Century\u2019s
  most remarkable digital revivals of classic typefaces like [[Caslon]], [[Baskerville]],
  and [[Bodoni]]. Although he played a withdrawn role in the international community
  of type designers, his work is sure to remain an inspiration for decades. In addition
  to this visual legacy, Franko Luin was proactive as an influence on future generations
  of designers, for instance he engagingly led a course in Web Typography at the [[Berghs
  School of Communication]] in [[Stockholm]].\r\n\r\nA third passion of Franko Luin\u2019s
  was [[Esperanto]], which he began learning at age 15. His involvement in Esperanto
  organizations even acted as an inspiration for his design work\u2014he named a type
  family after the language in 1993.\r\n\r\nMore information about Franko Luin and
  his typefaces is available at\r\nwww.linotype.com/7-1527-7/frankoluin.html and at
