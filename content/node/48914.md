    and is probably worth a visit. \r\n\r\nde Appel is a gallery where i've seen good
    contemporary art."

    Some highlights of the collection are exposed in the west wing.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal
    Museum (Stedel\u0133k Museum) looks like any building in Groznij or Gruzija after
    shelling. It's shut down and it's whispered there's overhaul going on. The collection
    (or part of it?) is in some frontier outpost in the harbour area.\r\n\r\nIf you
    like good coffee for consolation, give me a ring @ +31-6-2450-3943. I live a few
    minutes away from the Van Gogh Museum.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nThomas Milo\r\nDecoType\r\nwww.decotype.com"

    where we gobbled up the Gado-gado. But I don't. Is there a yellow pages? Looking
    at the map, I think it was Blue Pepper. But first we stopped at the Easy Times
    Cafe! The Rijks was awesome...if it's closed, a train ride to The Hague gets you
    to the Mauritshuis and the Municipal Museum, both well worth the visit, if art
    is your fancy. Man...happy you!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
