  body: "H\xE9ctor,\r\n\r\nMany years ago I developed an identity system for one of
    the city hospitals in Salem, Massachusetts (so old I no longer have a sample).
    I decided to use a stylized graphic of a flying dove since in the city's official
    seal there is a dove with olive branch.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Salem_Seal.gif]\r\nSeveral
    years after this, I noticed the new logo developed for Dove Soap as well as several
    other logos using graphics very similar to mine.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dovesoap.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/dove2.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/dove3.jpg]\r\nMy
    point is this: there are many things, flora or fauna in the real world that have
    significant symbolic meanings. Birds, dove, hawk, lion, snake, rose, clouds, fire,
    eyes, hands, and so on. Your use of a flame, torch, fire, etc. is bound to be
    similar to other identity systems whether you were inspired directly by them or
    not, and IMHO your treatment of the flame does not come close enough for the two
    logos to be confused. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I would stick with the direction on
    the graphic you are taking. You may only want to consider a variation on the typeface
    that would be less similar theirs."

    but this treatment of the uppercase \"I\" came to mind. Perhaps you also thought
    of this but found it too obvious to be unique. Just a thought, but the typeface
    still needs to be changed.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/innova2.gif]"

    grabbers. I'll be experimenting with other typefaces and treatments. I just like
    so much how Quadraat works on this that I'm not so satisfied with what I have
    tried so far.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    that the flame part can eventually be used seperately. I think a sans or a slab
    would be best for thr type.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"
