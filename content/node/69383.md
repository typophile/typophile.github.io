  body: Now that I see it bigger, it's nothing like Kontrapunkt ;) the serifs on this
    are unique, I would guess this is custom.

  body: "Most likely, this is a customisation of <a href=\"http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_gridnik/gridnik.html\">Foundry
    Gridnik</a>. Apart from the obvious differences, \u2018O\u2019, \u2018S\u2019,
    \u2018U\u2019 and other glyphs are virtually identical to the ones in the typeface.
    The letters used by \u2018Hochschule Luzern\u2019 are just slightly fatter than
    the boldest weight available commercially."

    site \u2013 FS Sinclair is sort of in the general ballpark (similar \"S\") but
    definitely isn't it. "
