body: this is a face i&#39;ve been developing based on a couple of directions in type
  i&#39;m interested in personally. one being stencilled lettering ala the punk or
  d.i.y. music scene, and the second being the more structured, grid based forms we&#39;ve
  all been seeing a lot of lately. the first one is based on  a 14 x 8 grid, and the
  condensed just rotates the grid 90 degrees. each letter- and number-form fills the
  space, but i don&#39;t intend it to be a true monospace, due to bad optical spacing
  issues i&#39;m getting. i&#39;m not totally sure i like it, which is why i&#39;m
  posting. be harsh. is this something derivitave or that someone would actually buy/use?
  also looking for input on the forms themselves. thanks! <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1404.gif"

    just below that, and the numerals in the middle. '

  body: ' i agree. the &#34;s&#34; was actually developed as a logo, and the face
    was built around that concept. those forms definitely are more dense than the
    others--H, L, T, and U are the most open feeling-- but there&#39;s just not much
    to work with on those letters. i&#39;ve found that the condensed is easier to
    actually set type with, but the extended has a more unique feel. '

  body: Wow. This has got to be one of the best dystopian typefaces I have ever seen!
    <BR> <BR>Your subtle blend of stencil, blackletter and grid-based type is just
    excellent, and the condensed version, which imho is the best, even reads quite
    well. I can easily picture this successfully used in a cyberpunk scifi-flick on
    oppressive propaganda posters. &#40;Too bad you didn&#39;t finish it before they
    made Blade Runner... ;D&#41; The slanted line-ends are my favourite, as they subtly
    echo blackletter type and the &#40;undeserved&#41; associations that it has gained
    with Nazism, thus strengthening the totalitarian feel of the face. &#40;They also
    remind somewhat of <A HREF="http://www.typeco.com/3Gothic.html" TARGET="_blank">
    Gothic Gothic</A>, another great face.&#41; I hope I didn&#39;t read to much into
    your face... ;D <BR> <BR>Furthermore, making the normal and condensed verions
    related, but not by squishing or extending, is a stroke of genious. &#40;But skip
    the italics.&#41; However, the normal version seems a bit too heavy to my eye.
    I would look into either sacrificing the grid, or making it one &#34;pixel&#34;
    narrower. But then again, this might destroy the feel of the face. You could try
    it anyway. <BR> <BR>Also, shouldn&#39;t the stencil gap of your normal &#39;G&#39;
    be positioned like that on your normal &#39;C&#39;? And shouldn&#39;t the tail
    of the normal &#39;Q&#39; extend outside of the letter, just like that on the
    condesed &#39;Q&#39;? Possibly, you could also slant the line-end of the roof
    on the &#39;1&#39;. <BR> <BR> <BR>Btw, the name makes me associate to the computer
    game classic Syndicate, which indeed is very dark and dystopian. Is this intentional?
    Do you even know of the game?

  body: ' For me, I continue to love the &#34;solid&#34; characters --  the S, the
    G and the E, for instance. &#40;The non-condensed versions&#41;. The problem I
    have is that those characters don&#39;t sync up with the &#34;non-solid&#34; characters
    as well -- Q, U, and so on. On the other hand, there are some characters that
    are flat-out impossible to make fit into that paradigm, like the T and I -- no
    matter how you make them, they will never be as black as the S and G. <BR> <BR>So
    I&#39;d have to say things are going great -- I love the typeface. However, the
    condensed still doesn&#39;t turn my crank. '

  body: ' Tyler - well you know already how I feel about this face!&#42; So maybe
    some Typophiles can help answer some questions that really haven&#39;t been answered
    here. <BR> <BR>Specifically, if a face like this goes to retail, approximately
    HOW MANY copies &#40;licenses&#41; will be sold? <BR> <BR>There are plenty of
    lurkers who could give us some idea of retail sales. Someone said 50 might be
    an average of sales within the first year. <BR> <BR>For example, Gothic Gothic
    by IHOF. Is that selling 50 copies, 100 copies, or more? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve read
    about percentages offered by various foundries, but I&#39;ve never heard anyone
    mention how many of a particular font is sold. <BR> <BR>If anyone wants to contact
    Tyler or myself directly, we will respect your privacy and not share the information
    if that&#39;s what you request. <BR> <BR>thanks, <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>&#42; I
    contacted Tyler the day he posted this about possibly including Syndicate in Apollo
    26&#39;s first retail release. '
