  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have often heard that typography is more about the white spaces.
I&rsquo;ve been practicing in graphic design for around ten years and consider myself a pretty decent typographer, certainly not a typography superhero but decent. Yet I still have a hard time grasping the &ldquo;white spaces&rdquo; concept.
Contributions anyone?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Some say that the clinking of the glasses during a toast was meant to involve the &ldquo;final/fifth sense&rdquo;&hellip; hearing.
Using pens, as a first resort, has provided me with spacing skills that I would have missed out on otherwise. I find white spaces, spacing, etc. to be a lot like the rhythm and meter found in music. I find I am more interested, as I age, in the spaces/time between the notes.
Much like one&rsquo;s inability to pull apart a thread of music, without disrupting the flow, one must look at the paragraph in toto. One of the first books that gave me an &ldquo;Aha&rdquo; was a little book by Rudo Spemann, it took me a year to see the &ldquo;white&rdquo; but what a revelation it was.
The book by Cyrus is wonderful and augments what I have learned by doing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Whitespace is instinctively hard to grasp (probably mostly because we&rsquo;re taught to mark the black, because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s practical) which is probably why it generally gets short shrift, but it&rsquo;s also possible to give it <em>too</em> much relevance (perhaps as an over-reaction to the established &ldquo;injustice&rdquo;). Because really, the important thing is notan: the unity and relationship of black and white. Practically speaking, this means we should ideally design their border, not one or the other.

One-dimensional: line with no thickness, with an equivalence between letter as line and letter as counter. 
Two-dimensional: line as area, emphasizing the graphic ﬂatness of the surface upon which the mark rests.
Three-dimensional: complex shapes suggesting natural objects with depth, and/or a depth to the substrate.</p>

<p>no rhythm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Fourier transforms on blocks of text show a periodicity in text faces, bands of black and white. Another way of saying this is that in a the vertical strokes in a word tend to fall near vertical lines a set distance apart, namely half the width of the n.</p>
<p>As Héctor says, deviation from the exact periodicity is part of what we &lsquo;read&rsquo;. It is analogous to the regular beat in music, and the varied rhythm over the beat. When the typeface doesn&rsquo;t have that periodicity is like a dancer who &lsquo;loses the beat,&rsquo; and can&rsquo;t dance to the music.</p>
<p>One feature of good handling of white space is to get the widths of the characters and the side bearings in a font to relate to each other so there is that strong, but not totally regular periodicity. I think failing on rhythm, harmonious widths and sidebearings, is the most common failing in type design.</p>
<p>Because our eyes do not move continuously across the page, but in jumps, saccades, the analogy with music is not complete, but the periodicity, with regular beat and varied rhythm is analogous.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, the periodicity, moving horizontally across the word or lines of text, that Bill is referring to in his post above, is what I have been calling ‘narrow phase alignment.’ Perfect phase alignment is like a grating, and gives rise to a picket-fence effect in type. In a sense, the periodicity <em>is</em> an illusion, but the narrow phase alignment around a periodic mean is a fact, documentable with Fourier Transforms.</p>
<p>I think of narrow phase alignment as relating to the black.</p>
<p>The whites to me are a bit of a different story. I think good notan requires that the whites inside and between letters are all “in synch.” What that means specifically in terms of individual letters is difficult to describe, because, for example the o and the bowls of d / p / q / b have a circular expressedness, while n / h / u have a predominantly oblong or rectangular expressedness, and the a / e / s / z have a distrubed expressedness. So there must be a deviation from perfect equivalence to approximate a kind of optical cohesion.</p>
<p>The narrow phase alignment in the blacks and the optical cohesion in the whites hold the word together in gestalt terms as an internally well-composed visual unit.</p>
<p>You might insist there is no rhythm in text face design, but if you deny that the narrow phase alignment exists you are just wrong, and if you deny that it is important for easy word-recognition, you are telling me you are out of touch with what happens in the visual cortex during a fixation. In reading alphanumerical symbols, the visual system uses spatially frequency channels tuned to statistical regularities in the stimulus.</p>
<p>This has yet to be shown empirically, but I think it will eventually become evident to researchers looking at reading, that both the narrow phase alignment of the blacks and the rhythmic cohesion of the whites are critical for the rapid automatic visual word-form resolution that underlies reading.</p>

But it is indeed small. I don&rsquo;t think the parafovea can give you content, but only relative word length, as Peter notes. This is, however an important clue, at least in English.</p>
<p>Yes, the periodicity is not strictly speaking rhythm, because the horizontal axis is not time, but distance. However, the pictures are otherwise the same, so using the term rhythm is not misleading, so long as you understand that reading is by saccades and parallel processing.</p>
<p>The question of whether than hand in motion has anything to do with good or bad type design is totally another question. In fact, I think type, with its repetition of identical characters, forced a greater care with uniformity of periodicity, and a resulting higher readability of type vs handwriting.</p>
<p>So I and almost everyone else will, I think, ignore the Hrant language police and still use &lsquo;rhythm&rsquo; to refer to the very important issue of periodicity in type design.</p>

But in these cases accurate sense following requires confirmation and confirmation requires fixation on the word, rather than skipping. If efficient processing of the blacks and whites in parallel is the issue here, the relevance of phase alignment in the blacks, and rhythmic cohesion in the whites is again key)</p>
<p>The frequency of this depend on the “given” versus “new” (to the text – not the reader) status of the words in the text at hand.</p>
<p>Providing informative summary statistics (hpp: boumas) is a design challenge here, and the relationship of providing informative summary statistics to meeting the constraints governing efficient processing during a fixation is what needs investigation.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>re: the parafovea /  [not] <em>delivering</em> much <em>semantic information to the brain</em>.</p>
<p>The parafovea delivers <em>visual information</em> to the visual cortex. The deeper you go into the parafovea, that coarser the resolution capabilities of the parafovea are. Critical details of the role-unit components of letter forms (bowl / stem / counter) get lost or scrambled. Beyond a certain point, and up to about 15 character spaces, only “ensemble statistics” or “summary statistics”, that are sufficient for the guidance of eye movements, but insufficient for unambiguous word-recognition are available. Still, in the near parafovea the resolution capabilities are often sufficient for the visual system to predict and confirm correctly the identity of short contextually expected words like ‘the’ and ‘in’ and ‘at’ without having to attend to them specifically. Except in [to clarify: with the exception of] these cases, fixational attention is required for identification to occur. Also, in the near parafoveal, just beyond the reach of foveal vision, there can be what is called “eccentric enhancement” of what strictly speaking falls in the near parafovea just outside the actual fovea. This has the effect of enlarging the “uncrowded span” to the point where 5 to 8 letter words are fully accessible in a single fixation to parallel processing.</p>

<p>The brain is heuristic (because that&rsquo;s more efficient in the long term). Unambiguity is for mindless machines.</p>
<p>The decreasing acuity of the parafovea (plus the fact that saccades <em>do</em> go way beyond the fovea) is exactly why [multi-letter] boumas exist; Kevin is probably correct that you don&rsquo;t need boumas in the fovea, and that&rsquo;s probably why they don&rsquo;t show up in his fovea-centric field testing.</p>
<blockquote>This has the effect of enlarging the “uncrowded span” to the point where 5 to 8 letter words are fully accessible in a single fixation to parallel processing.</blockquote>
<p>And evidence of even longer saccades* clearly extends that range, because absolute certainty is not the point; if the bouma is distinctive enough, and if the context is helpful enough, you can read it very deep into the parafovea. But there&rsquo;s no point referring to that as an &ldquo;extended fovea&rdquo; - just call it what it is: the parafovea delivering content.</p>

<p>You are the only person in any of these discussions who equates rhythm with flow. You persist in speaking about rhythm as if we were talking about it as an aspect of reading, when it is obvious that Bill and Peter and I and others are talking about is rhythm <em>as an aspect of what is read,</em> i.e. not of the processing but of what is processed. Your comment about saccade length is, therefore, a red herring, because we&rsquo;re not talking about rhythm of saccades but of what is perceived during fixations. Peter is simply correct: narrow phase alignment of blacks is an observable and measurable feature of the Latin writing system in general and Latin text types in particular. You can debate what role this plays in reading and readability &ndash; and even suggest that deviating from it might improve readability, although I think there are good reasons to doubt this &ndash;, but calling it an illusion is silly.</p>

<p>Actually I didn’t.</p>
<p>I said “Also, in the near parafoveal, just beyond the reach of foveal vision, there can be what is called “eccentric enhancement” of what strictly speaking falls in the near parafovea just outside the actual fovea. This has the effect of enlarging the “uncrowded span” to the point where 5 to 8 letter words are fully accessible in a single fixation to parallel processing.”</p>
<p>As explained in the wikipedia lemma on eye movements in reading, only four to five letters are seen with 100% acuity. The uncrowded window of object recognition stretches a bit beyond what foveal vision yields if the spacing between letters is wider than the critical spacing for crowding.</p>
<p>Also in the wikipedia lemma: “The distance the eye moves in each saccade (or short rapid movement) is between 1 and 20 characters with the average being 7–9 characters.” The cited source for this is Karl Rayner and colleagues, but the average of 7-9 characters sound a bit low to me and might be somewhat misleading, because saccade length depends on the visio-spatial composition of the linguistic information in parafoveal vision. If there is a short function word like ‘is’ or ‘the’ followed by a longer substance word, I think the saccade is considerably longer than when a key noun is followed by an important verb, or an important adjective is followed by the noun it modifies.</p>
<p>And by the way, I didn’t say function words are ignored!</p>

<p>That may well be, but I think there is quite a bit of work done by Gordon Legge and colleagues that shows that when foveal vision deteriorates to the point that is is largely disabled, and a person must use parafoveal vision to read, reading is slower, becomes laborious, far less automatic, and the visual span becomes reduced in size to fewer characters being processed at one time.</p>

<p>[from a paper by Legge and colleagues at http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.76.9876&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf
“Chung et al. (1998) found a 4.4-fold reduction in maximum reading speed at 15° eccentricity compared with central vision.”</p>
<p>The findings of the paper “are consistent with the following interpretation. When text is presented in peripheral vision, the visual span gets narrower; the reader recognizes fewer letters per fixation. As a consequence, the reader saccades through the text in smaller steps with a corresponding reduction in reading speed. In effect, the capacity of normal vision to process several letters in parallel deteriorates in peripheral vision. According to this interpretation, a fundamental limit to reading in peripheral vision is the reduction in the size of the visual span. This may explain the reading deficits commonly observed in people with central scotomas.”</p>
<p>You can also try and sort through the links that come up when you google “reading without a fovea.”</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the correction Peter. But isn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;fovea&rsquo; not sharply defined physiologically? So really the issue is how many characters can be recognized. The slowing of reading to less than a quarter of normal at 15+ degrees is really interesting. Actually I&rsquo;m surprised you can be that fast with the middle 15% blotted out. According to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis|this article on the Fovea]], the fovea only covers 2 degrees. If we can see enough in the flanking 6 or 7 degrees to read even a quarter the speed, then I think that Hrant must be right that quite a bit of information is got up to the 20 letters of the biggest saccade. If the fovea is 2 degrees, and gets you sharply 4-5 letters, then an additional 6 degrees would span an additional 9 or 10 letters. So the those letters may not be so clear, if you can read with them, even slowly—and probably more quickly than at 15 degrees—that&rsquo;s very significant. I&rsquo;m getting more converted to Hrant&rsquo;s view on the importance of the parafovea from this information. Peter, is there something I&rsquo;m not getting in your view, or do you agree?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Legge and Pelli have shown the the issue is how wide the “uncrowded span” is. Pelli claims this varies from individual to individual, with a range from 5 to 9 characters, and that isolating sections of text from the background text using an eye-tracker can maximize this.</p>
<p>Most eye movement scientists have concluded that the information in the parafovea to the right side of the fixated word, when it contains new words, sets up the following saccade and provides some visual information about the upcoming words which goes beyond just the word’s length and boundaries, but, because the uptake there is sub-attentive, doesn&rsquo;t lead to actual full visual word form resolution to the point at which word identification can occur.</p>
<p>The information in this area is subject to heavy crowding, and provides what is termed a “parafoveal preview benefit.” The parafoveal preview benefit speeds up next-word recognition, but doesn’t replace a fixation to it. The effect is similar to priming.</p>
<p>What the visual information is that is provided in parafoveal preview is unclear and controversial. Perceptual psychophysicists, who emphasize crowding use the term “ensemble statistics” or “summary statistics” to describe it, and have used scrambled letter ‘mongrels’ to help us visualize it. The people who study eye movement say some letter-level information is gathered. Herman Bouma used terms like circular or rectangular expressedness, and sidedness at the stoke and letter level to describe what can be gathered from the near parafovea.</p>
<p>I think “ensemble statistics” or “summary statistics” are terms that suggest the information is averaged across a word, which I don’t think is accurate. I&rsquo;ve suggested to Pelli that a term like “jumble statistics” be used.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s best to base definitions on observable things, and to me the only useful definition of the fovea is derived from acuity, which is known to fall steeply beyond a certain point (preventing decipherment of individual letters). Speaking of the fovea as something more only serves to obscure the powerful role of decipherment beyond individual letters (i.e. reading boumas deep into the parafovea).</p>
<blockquote>So really the issue is how many characters can be recognized.</blockquote>
<p>How many <em>boumas</em> (which can be single letters in the fovea, and full words quite a distance from the fovea).</p>
<p>Peter, just like concluding that the parafovea is totally useless because individual letters are too blurry, there must be something wrong with the mainstream interpretation of crowding. The proof is in the pudding: saccades can be long enough to blow the model you describe out of the water.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, I&rsquo;m confused. I just started reading the Legge et al paper and they say that Rayner and Bertera (1979) used an eye tracking method to mask letters. &ldquo;When the mask covered the seven central letters, reading speed was very low, about 12 words/min. When the mask covered 11 letters, reading was essentially impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t understand what is happening at the 15 degree angle. I guess I will have to read it further. But from this quoted information, I don&rsquo;t see how anything beyond 11 letters can have much visual information. Legge et al put the &ldquo;visual span&rdquo; 10 letters. Are the 4-5 letters in the fovea? are the flanking letters, 2-3 on either side in the parafovea? I can&rsquo;t study this right now, but now I&rsquo;m swinging back against Hrant&rsquo;s view, which is, I take it, there is semantic information in the 11-20 letter area.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Average saccade distance is 7-9 characters. How frequent are those long saccades (20 characters)? And what do they tend to encompass in terms of text (short, common, contextually obvious words that are skipped?)?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve experimented with wilfully inhibiting saccades, trying to maintain a fixation and consciously examine my parafoveal perception of text. And it is <em>bloody difficult.</em> We want to read and we are trained by habit to read, and since saccades are unconscious actions they are hard to inhibit. So unless I was trying this with an eye tracker to determine whether I was successful in maintaining a fixation and not unconsciously flicking ahead, I don&rsquo;t think I could say whether perception of content in the parafovea was actual or the result of a sneaky saccade. I do know that I always seem to have better perception of content to the right of my fixation than to the left, which is why I suspect that I am unconsciously shifting my fixation despite my efforts to maintain it in one place. I also know that the more successful I seem to be in maintaining a fixation, the less I can perceive any meaningful content in the parafovea: crowding causes the letters to blur into each other, and I reckon one would need radically distinctive shapes in order to resolve parafovea boumas into unambiguous cues: writing systems don&rsquo;t provide such shapes &ndash; could they even? given the number of linguistic entities that they need to represent &ndash;, and hence what I perceive in the parafovea often might be resolved to any number of possible letter sequences that look roughly the same in crowding.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I haven&rsquo;t seen a corpus of long saccades to study the saccaded text (that would be very interesting). But the simple fact that they exist is the key thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried conscious parafoveal reading myself, and you&rsquo;re right about the difficulty! :-)  But I do use the parafovea consciously sometimes, mostly for its superior (to the fovea) ability to detect motion: like sometimes when I&rsquo;m driving out of a &ldquo;blind&rdquo; area I&rsquo;ll look straight ahead instead of continuously flicking my head left-right, ready to hit the brakes if I detect movement in the parafovea. Also, I have on occasion caught myself using the parafovea after the fact, for example when playing tennis; I have to think professional tennis players have moved this ability fully into real-time consciousness.</p>
<blockquote>I do know that I always seem to have better perception of content to the right of my fixation than to the left, which is why I suspect that I am unconsciously shifting my fixation</blockquote>
<p>But fixation location data does not support this perception; there is no &ldquo;forward stutter&rdquo; in fixation points before a big leap. So ignoring the left side is probably coming from our brain knowing it doesn&rsquo;t need it, and the effort is better spent on the right side.</p>
<p>As an aside concerning directionality: Derrick de Kerckhove has co-edited a book (&ldquo;The Alphabet And The Brain: The Lateralization Of Writing&rdquo;) which included an article by himself where he claims that leftward writing systems have inferior readability because the left halves of our retinas (which receive the right half of the visual field) are closer to the parts of the brain that read.</p>
<blockquote>crowding causes the letters to blur into each other</blockquote>
<p>But the information is still there - it can&rsquo;t disappear, so here&rsquo;s what I think: it&rsquo;s entirely possible there&rsquo;s a hidden-from-consciousness mechanism to read extremely blurry boumas, something we&rsquo;ve never been consciously trained to do. This &ldquo;library&rdquo; would be built up in our minds without us even realizing.</p>
<p>BTW, about the relative speed of fovea-less reading: how much time were people given to adapt to it? Since it&rsquo;s such a strange experience I think people could speed up a good deal with practice. Consider how long it takes for children to transition from letterwise reading to immersive reading.</p>

Also, I have on occasion caught myself using the parafovea after the fact, for example when playing tennis</em></p>
<p>Movement is, as your tennis experience shows, a whole other ball game. We are attuned to movement in the parafovea, for all sorts of good evolutionary purposes. And yes, there is evidence that some sports players are as good as they are in part because of exceptional peripheral vision (I recall a news story about Gretsky being tested in this regard).</p>
<p>But text in the parafovea is static and crowded. So the fact that we do one kind of thing very well in the parafovea and peripheral vision &ndash; sense movement &ndash;, is not an indicator that we do something else well.</p>
<p><em>But the information is still there - it can&rsquo;t disappear</em></p>
<p>Let me make a scholastic distinction between antecedent information and effective information. We&rsquo;re surrounded all the time by an immense amount of antecedent information, i.e. information that we might cognitively process, consciously or unconsciously, with the appropriate sense abilities. But we don&rsquo;t always have the appropriate sense abilities. For example, I have about an average sense of smell for a human being, which determines the amount of effective olfactory information I am able to glean from the vast amount of antecedent smell information that surrounds me. My dog has vastly better sense abilities when it comes to smell, though, both in terms of her physiological ability to smell more and her apparent ability to process that information.</p>
<p>The antecedent information available in the text in our parafovea vision does not necessarily make the transition into effective information, except in the way that researchers have already been able to demonstrate: next-fixation cueing. Now it seems to me that this demonstrated use of parafoveal vision to cue the next fixation provides a likely clue as to what happens in long saccades, which is why my question about what kind of text those saccades typically cover is an important one. If such saccades tend to include multiple short and common words, then it seems very likely to me that in cueing the next fixation the brain is already guessing or assuming what those words are, and that process can be more easily explained, I think, by linguistic context than by a putative &lsquo;hidden-from-consciousness mechanism to read extremely blurry boumas&rsquo; (cf Brother William&rsquo;s razor).</p>
<p>Now, to give your idea its due, I am willing to accept that <em>if</em> particular short words happen to have highly distinctive blurry boumas that are not easily confusable with other blurry boumas, then that is information that could contribute to guessing the content and hence prompting a longer saccade. I also think that frequency of potentially confusable boumas being resolved to particular short words would likely be made use of in such guessing, i.e. if a particular blurry bouma turns out to be the word &lsquo;and&rsquo; much more often than not, then that would encourage the reader to assume that when cueing a long saccade.</p>
<p>The nature of crowding seems to me to strongly militate against recognition of parafoveal boumas as parts of longer words, which is why I am anticipating that longer saccades are made up of shorter words.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The current view is that, during a fixation on a foveated word (while rapid automatic visual word-form resolution is occurring relative to that foveated word) parafoveal vision is covertly or sub-attentively gathering coarse-grained information on the next word to be fixated, and the claim is this facilitates the processing of the next word to be fixated. I think this idea is an elegant one, makes excellent intuitive sense, and is well-supported by the data on the size of the uncrowded span, and <em>average</em> saccade length.</p>
<p>My impression Hrant, is that you under-estimate the demonstrable extent of the uncrowded span and focus on maximum saccade length, rather than the mean, or the most common saccade length — treating the maximum as the norm or what can become the norm — to come up with your ideas. I would want to know how regressions and corrective saccades factor into this estimate as well. Do they normally occur more frequently when saccades exceed the mean or most common length? What is the spread? How many saccades exceed the mean or most frequent length. How many undershoot it. Is there a cluster effect around the mean or most common saccade length?</p>
<p>If the type designer is to design for recognizing shapes that we haven&rsquo;t learned to decipher consciously (because we don&rsquo;t have to) but can be mapped to words, wouldn&rsquo;t he or she need to know what the shapes delivered by crowding, that constitute the min’s representation of words look like?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m sure the maximum is not the norm (by definition) and I doubt if it can ever become the norm*; but to me it is the direction to head. It shows -or at least hints at- what our reading mechanism is capable of, and I hope we can make fonts that leverage this mechanism to its fullest. My own reasons for trying to understand reading involve virtually no academic curiosity - I want to help, on the ground.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unless we can implement a dynamic display system where letters are enlarged in proportion to their distance from the fixation point, with saccades becoming &ldquo;virtual&rdquo;; we just need to figure out a way to ideally trigger a refresh (and as needed a regression) of the text displayed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of regressions (which can only exist as a result of bad guesswork - any model worth its salt needs to convincingly account for guesswork) I would certainly expect that one would be more likely the longer the previous saccade, all else -most notably the experience of the reader- being equal.</p>
<blockquote>wouldn't he or she need to know what the shapes delivered by crowding, that constitute the min’s representation of words look like?</blockquote>
<p>Ideally yes.
But even lacking that information it should be possible to improve things based simply on the principle of bouma divergence.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a well-understood sharp fall in retinal acuity (which is where I demarcate fovea/parafovea). Is there a sharp rise in crowding a notable distance from that fall in acuity?

And how do you define &ldquo;too much crowding&rdquo; - is it a matter of not being able to decipher individual letters, or words, and given how much time? And what about context?”</p>
<p>There is an extensive literature on crowding. 
A good place to start is here: 
<a href="http://www.journalofvision.org/content/11/5/13.full.pdf+html">http://www.journalofvision.org/content/11/5/13.full.pdf+html</a>

<a href="http://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/pubs/pelli2008uncrowded-complete.pdf">http://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/pubs/pelli2008uncrowded-complete.pdf</a>
You need to look at the literature yourself to determine if it is of use to you.</p>
<p>The increase in crowding with eccentricity is addressed by “Bouma’s Law.” Sometimes identifying a letter flanked by other letters is the task. Less frequently, words in lines of text are used. The subject is generally given unlimited time. Most often the effect of sentence context is not considered. Various factors are shown to provide a release from crowding.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant, if your going to help people on the ground with an understanding of reading that can stand up, you need to take the time to deal with the empirical studies. The eye movement research hasn’t really taken full account of the crowding findings yet (which come from perceptual psychophysics), and crowding studies haven’t so far addressed the additional complications involved in assessing the parafoveal preview benefit (a concept that comes from the eye movement in reading studies).</p>
<p>The parafoveal crowding and ensemble statistics findings come from tests using sidelong attention and involve no time constraints. Parafoveal pre-processing happens sub-attentively, and has a one-quarter second or so time constraint. Grouping and configural effects also modulate crowding, so an adequate theory of parafoveal pre-processing that can address issues in type design will need to take all this into account.</p>

<p>Agreed, and that is something I did do for a number of years in the beginning. Time -especially in sufficiently large contiguous blocks- has been getting tighter and tighter.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t have a great interest in bouma and parafoval recognition and these types of things because I regard myself as a display face maker, not a text face maker.  However all this talk has got me curious.  It seems to me when discussing the shapes of words that are not in the center of your vision, that mostly what counts is the outside of the letters, after all, thats what would make up a word shape&ndash;whether or not the outside of the letters were curved or straight, if they had any ascenders or descenders, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be very interested to see how a face might do that only has the outside of the letters intact, and with insides that are all messed up and random.  I think the only problem may be with the lower case e and a, i think seeing those crossbars in the middle of the letter is very important.</p>
<p>In a test of purely parafoval reading, it would be interesting to see how a face constructed like the one below would fair.</p>

<p>Your model is based on the notion that most of the visual part of reading — what I like to call rapid automatic visual word-form resolution — happens <em>away</em> from the fixation point, and the word the fixation and visual attention is on, i.e., in parafoveal vision, away from where direct visual attention is attentionally allocated. This is monumentally counter-intuitive. Virtually everything I&rsquo;ve read supports the widely-held notion that while visual attention and word recognition is occurring at the fixated word, some kind of ancilliary gathering of information is occurring relative to the next word to be fixated, which benefits the processing of that subsequent word once it is fixated. The bulk of rapid automatic visual word-form resolution happens inside the uncrowded span.</p>

However I would actually say that virtually everything you&rsquo;ve read (and I&rsquo;ve read) sadly suffers from a total oblivion of intuition, which isn&rsquo;t some divine gift - it comes from experience with anecdotal evidence. Everybody rightly points this out all the time: the people doing typographic testing have virtually zero typographic experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When intuition is joined to exact research it speeds the progress of exact research.&rdquo;

<p>All those studies crumble in credibility when you try to factor in the simple existence of very long saccades. So why are all these scientists failing? I&rsquo;ve opined this before: their tests suck at getting people truly immersed. When you&rsquo;re not immersed, yes, the fovea is king. But when you <em>are</em> immersed, the fovea is nothing that special.</p>

<p>You say that everything changes with &lsquo;immersion&rsquo;. What speed is immersion, and what evidence is there of a shift in the function of the fovea? Note that the study Peter linked earlier says that when the central 11 letters are fuzzed out in a &lsquo;moving window&rsquo;, people can&rsquo;t read at all. If the parafovea in the 11-20 letter region to the right (in l-r language alphabets) were so important, I don&rsquo;t see why this should be so. Can you explain it under your theory?</p>

<blockquote>What speed is immersion</blockquote>
<p>Of course it varies by individual (thanks to experience, which is gained more slowly than one might think*) but towards the top end it should be at least 500 wpm (if memory serves - I admit to having become a bit rusty on the numbers). However I actually don&rsquo;t believe immersion is black-and-white: after maybe around age 10 virtually everybody knows how to read immersively at least a little bit; but what might be called &ldquo;deep immersion&rdquo; requires pretty good conditions. Conditions that I feel are not being reproduced in labs.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example it&rsquo;s been shown that grad students read faster than undergrads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parafoveal boumas aren&rsquo;t more important than foveal ones, but they&rsquo;re not less important either. The key thing it: <em>somehow</em> they&rsquo;re being used; not all the time, but certainly when Distinctiveness×Context÷Blur is high enough. I think we might essentially be disagreeing on how incapacitating Blur (low fidelity + crowding) is.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>According to [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28activity%29#Reading_rate|this summary]] usual reading rates with full comprehension are around 150 wpm. 500 is clearly &lsquo;skimming&rsquo; with reduced comprehension. If that is &lsquo;immersion&rsquo;, then I think we&rsquo;re not talking about the same thing. Skimming is a very valuable skill for research, but it is a matter of sampling text to get a general idea.</p>
<p>Are you saying we only read to the right of the center of a fixation? The research on the uncrowded window I thought says that we are able to identify 4-5 letters to the left and right of the center of the fixation. The info beyond the 10 letters may be only used to the right, but that is another matter.</p>
<p>Also you haven&rsquo;t answered the question of why we can&rsquo;t read at all when the middle 11 letters of the fixation are blurred out. Until you answer that question, I don&rsquo;t see how your view of the overwhelming importance of the 10-20 characters to the right has any credibility.</p>

<p>Yes. I think the <em>information</em> your so-called “parafoveal boumas” provide 1) contributes directly to sense-following by supporting skipping and 2) contributes indirectly to fixation times by providing a preview benefit that facilitates a) strategic saccade planning and b) the uptake of visual information at the next fixation.</p>
<p>The<em> information</em>, which is sometimes referred to with the terms “ensemble statistics” or “summary statistics” is known to be coarse grained, and presumed to be locally differentiated (i.e., not just about the envelope structure of the word). It is also about as resolvable in actual “word-form resolution” terms as the “metamers of moby dick” we dickered about some time ago are.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, what you call &lsquo;parafoveal boumas&rsquo; seem to me so unresolvable in terms of word-recognition, due to crowding, as to not really constitute boumas at all. What we can perceive in the parafovea, thanks to the existence of word spaces that break up the crowded string, is the presence and length of words, and that is sufficient information to provide the processing benefits that Peter describes. From the content of the text and from experience we can reliably anticipate many shorter words and hence skip them, which accounts for longer saccades. In order for the existence of long saccades to be as important as you claim it to be, such saccades would need to regularly include longer words, uncommon words, and not be frequently followed by reversions. If these are not the case, then long saccades are accounted for by skipping and guessing, without requiring any parafoveal bouma recognition.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I imagine letter recognition in the parafovea as being like a game of battleships.
Or the blind man feeling different parts of the elephant and trying to infer what the whole animal is.
In other words, you don’t perceive a blurry image of a whole letter or word, but you get enough on/off data points to be able to infer a general range of possibilities.
Yes, you got a hit!—but is it a sub or an aircraft carrier?</div>

This time, Hrant wants to ride the black horsey with the blue mane, and you and Peter have to ride the Appaloosa and the Holstein. And I think it&rsquo;s Bill&rsquo;s turn to control the throttle.
