    read the essay, very entertaining. However, now that it appears we are taking

    &#34;Swiss&#34;, as in &#34;of Switzerland&#34;. The name of the country would

    is still around us, sometimes in plainclothes. It would be so much easier for
    us if there appeared on the world scene somebody saying, &#34;I want to reopen
    Auschwitz, I want the Blackshirts to parade again in the Italian squares.&#34;
    Life is not that simple. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises.
    Our duty is to uncover it and to point our finger at any of its new instances '

    pointed out that there&#39;s a great resonance, in formal aesthetics, between
    drill sargeant Busby Berkley&#39;s Hollwood spectacles, and the Nuremburg Rally
    as filmed by Leni Riefenstahl. <BR> <BR>And in type, the Nazi flip-flop over whether
    blackletter or humanist typeform was better for the Third Reich is clearly documented
    in Chris Burke&#39;s &#34;Renner&#34;. <BR> <BR>As for genesis, Helvetica is a
    revival, made in the WW2-neutral Switzerland, of a widely-used genre &#40;grotesque&#41;
    at least 60 years old at the time &#40;from Akzidenz Grotesque&#41;, while its
    capitals go back at least to the 1830s, in London &#40;as I show in my essay&#41;.  There

    Helvetica is entirely circumstantial &#40;nonetheless, such evidence can be grounds
    for conviction&#41;. <BR> <BR>For those who have not read my essay, the gist of
    the argument is that the dominant typefaces of today are a limited number of mid-20th
    Century sans serif faces. <BR>The quality of typography is hence traditional,
    conformist, utilitarian and banal: these are the qualities of a fascist aesthetic.  <BR>
    <BR>Helvetica was entrenched in digital culture by the mass-scale distribution
    of two organizations Apple &#40;as a Laserwriter and system font&#41; and Microsoft
    &#40;with IE&#41; which enjoy a virtual monopoly -- akin to a totalitarian position.
    <BR> <BR>While both communism and fascism were totalitarian movements, the communist
    aesthetic was anti-traditional and experimental &#40;eg Stalin and Mao&#39;s democidal
    collectivization of agriculture&#41;. <BR> <BR>The origin of the word &#34;fascist&#34;
    is the Latin word &#34;fasces&#34;, meaning a bundle of reeds &#40;an image used
    in Nazi regalia&#41;. It denotes being bound to the Leader, the Party, the Fatherland,
    the Ideology.  &#34;Bundle&#34; is also the word used to describe how Helvetica
    etc. are distributed. Hmmm...'

    qualities you assume are associated with egalitarianism, socialism, and &#34;one

    particular ideological-historical circumstances, the formal qualities &#40;the
    shapes&#41; of that typeface have no innate relationship with that ideology, and
    that typeface may subsequently be used to serve different ideological ends. Typefaces
    acquire ideological significance through association. <BR> <BR>These four aesthetic
    qualities are independent of the appearance of the typeface, and yet they have
    been acquired by it during use:   <BR> <BR>Traditional. Helvetica is a revival
    of the 19th century grotesque. <BR> <BR>Conformist. Helvetica is chosen because
    people don&#39;t want to stand out in a crowd by using something with a unique
    personality: &#34;timeless and neutral&#34;. <BR> <BR>Utilitarian. Helvetica is
    the preferred face of timetables, labels and signage. <BR> <BR>Banal. Helvetica
    is the default. <BR> <BR>The same aesthetic qualities also belong to Times Roman,
    a face of quite different appearance to helvetica. <BR> <BR>But are these fascist
    qualities, William asks? <BR> <BR>&#62;The distinctive thing to me about the fascist
    aesthetic is that it favors the grand, pompous and brutal, with as much glamor
    as possible. <BR> <BR>That could be said of any militaristic state. The four qualities
    I am focusing on are likewise not exclusive, but I present them as a coherent
    group, with support from Eco: <BR> <BR>Traditional. Eco: &#34;The first feature
    of Ur-Fascism is the cult of tradition...there can be no advancement of learning.
    Truth already has been spelled out once and for all...&#34; <BR> <BR>Conformist.
    Eco: &#34;Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks consensus by exploiting and exacerbating
    the natural fear of difference.&#34; <BR> <BR>Utilitarian. The fascist state exists
    not for the pleasure of its citizens, but to enforce its ideology on the world.
    <BR> <BR>Banality. Eco: &#34;...the cult of action for action&#39;s sake. Action
    being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, reflection. Thinking
    is a form of emasculation.&#34; This viewpoint follows from Hannah Arendt&#39;s

  body: 1. Eco is talking about &#39;Ur-fascism&#39; - his concoction - not fascism.
    Without the militarism and brutality and anti-egalitarianism of fascism, he seems
    to be just pasting an emotionally charged word on something that he doesn&#39;t
    like. To me it looks like he is just blowing smoke, but perhaps in context I would
    be more impressed.  <BR> <BR>2. Your the way in which you - or is it Eco - use
    &#39;utilitarean&#39; is incorrect. Utilitarean means useful to people, not useless.  <BR>
    <BR>3. Hannah Arendt was just blowing smoke also. Eichmann was just evil, and
    not banal. He knew damn well what he was doing and her thesis doesn&#39;t hold
    up against actual testimony against him. <BR> <BR>You know more about the history
    of type than I - and I do admire your essays, with the exeception of the stuff
    about fascism! - but wasn&#39;t &#39;modernism&#39; in architecture and type motivated
    partly by socialist ideals? The Bauhaus I believe were overtly socialist, and
    they saw their work, including the type as furthering their ideals. Isn&#39;t
    Helvetica a further wrinkle in the modernist movement in type, a furthering of
    Bauhaus ideals? Just asking.

    and a general ideological form, Eco came up with the term &#34;Ur-fascism&#39;.
    As he admits: &#34;In spite of some fuzziness regarding the difference between
    various historical forms of fascism, I think it is possible to outline a list
    of features that are typical of what I would like to call Ur-Fascism, or Eternal
    Fascism. These features cannot be organized into a system; many of them contradict
    each other, and are also typical of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism. But
    it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around
    it.&#34; Yeah, cultural theory tends to be a bit smoky! <BR> <BR>2. Certainly,
    Utilitarianism as a philosophy means useful to people &#40;the greatest good for
    the greatest number&#41;. However, the word utilitarian is generally understood
    to mean &#34;merely&#34; useful for material ends -- inhuman, in fact. It&#39;s
    a put-down, stemming from the realisation in the latter 19th Century that cold-blooded
    industrial capitalism could easily be rationalized by such a &#34;Benthamite&#34;
    philosophy, with devastating results for a large number of the population. <BR>
    <BR>3. I trust Arendt&#39;s assessment. She was at Nuremburg, and her concept
    of the &#34;banality of evil&#34; makes sense in relation to Milgram&#39;s behavioral
    studies of obedience, from the same era. <BR> <BR>Helvetica, modernism, and socialism:
    <BR>there is some overlap, and many ironies. <BR>The grotesque letterform was
    modern, invented in signage during the birth of the modern industrial era, in
    London, 1805 &#40;Justin Howes spoke on this at the Bad Type conference&#41;.
    No doubt the sign painters were Chartists &#40;the socialists of the day&#41;,
    but it&#39;s more likely that this extreme trend in letterform was just the way
    that people expressed themselves in the most tumultuous of times. <BR> <BR>The
    bauhaus &#34;socialist&#34; ideal you refer to: that the artist has a duty to
    society. <BR> <BR>If that is the case, the duty of artists is to use today&#39;s

  body: 'I don&#39;t think Arendt ever claimed that Eichmann was &#39;a thoughtless
    cog in a bureaucratic machine&#39;: the famous banality phrase refers to the <i>way</i>
    he went about murdering millions of people, having once decided that he would
    do it &#40;what Eichmann called his &#39;Pontius Pilate moment&#39;&#41;. Arendt
    is contrasting the reality of this small minded man, obsessing about the train
    schedules to and from Auschwitz, to the kind of sadistic monster who gets personal
    pleasure from specific acts of murder &#40;e.g. Stalin&#39;s secret police chief,
    Beria, who insisted on personally executing many &#39;enemies of the revolution&#39;&#41;.
    Eichmann&#39;s Final Solution was designed to depersonalise the murder, by turning
    it into a bureaucratically ordered, mechanised, assembly line for corpses and
    ash. And this was something new in our understanding when Arendt wrote <i>Eichmann
    in Jerusalem,</i> as the comments of the prosecutor show: we expect people who
    perform monstrous acts to be monsters, and their ordinariness is apalling. I think
    Arendt&#39;s famous quote mischaracterises evil: it is not that evil is banal
    per se, but that evil <i>can</i> become part of the everyday and the normal. It
    does not require monsters: Eichmann&#39;s system, while it permitted individual
    sadism, did not require sadism. Nowhere in any of this is it suggested that Eichmann
    was an unthinking cog in a bureaucracy: he <i>designed</i> the bureaucracy.'

    <BR> <BR>&#39;According to Arendt, ... he was an ordinary bureaucrat who &#34;except
    for an extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement . .
    . had no motives at all.&#34; Her point is that Eichmann, though a high-level
    Nazi official, was not strongly influenced by Nazi ideas.&#34;&#39; <BR> <BR>Then
    follows Miller&#39;s paragraph I quoted earlier refuting Arendt&#39;s claim. She
    is simply wrong about him having no motives, for he was in fact a fanatical devotee
    of Hitler.  <BR> <BR>Furthermore, she says, &#39;in the postscript to Eichmann
    in Jerusalem...: &#34;The essence of totalitarian government, and perhaps the
    nature of every bureaucracy, is to make functionaries and mere cogs in the administrative
    machinery out of men, and thus to dehumanize them.&#34; In her view, Eichmann
    was so much the bureaucratic man that he &#34;never realized what he was doing
    [emphasis in original].&#34;&#39; <BR> <BR>But the reality was that, contrary
    to Arendt, he did realize what he was doing and knowingly choose to do it.  <BR>
    <BR>Miller, as I quoted earlier, does not think that anyone has made a general
    claim that people must be specially monsterous to do great evil. In fact in the
    view of both Judaism and Christianity ordinary people have the capacity for great
    good and great evil alike, and the choice. The fact that the prosecutor had this
    view is not indicative that his view is the traditional one, even though it may
    be common in drama.  <BR> <BR>The important point here is that you cannot shift
    the blame from individuals to bureaucracy itself, which is what seems to be the
    thrust of Arendt&#39;s argument, and what Nick and Eco were refering to. <BR>
    <BR>Bureaucracy certainly puts pressure on people to do wrong, but so does the
    rest of life. Some people have more moral courage and some less. Living with bureaucracy
    is one of the central moral challenges of our times. Arendt says that it is the
    nature of bureaucracies to dehumanize. But families and rulers could do that before.
    This pressure is not radically new; what is new is not the pressures but the efficiency
    of bureaucracy.  <BR> <BR>Her getting it wrong is to the point here, because a
    knee jerk reaction of many on these discussion boards is to see every bureaucracy
    and large organization as evil. All have tendencies to evil, but some are largely
    good and some largely evil, and there are all gradations in between. And it is
    up to us as part of them or dealing with them to do our part in a good way, and
    not to cooperate when they are going to do wrong.  <BR> <BR>What I see often on
    these boards is people totally condemning all corporations and also working for
    them or with them. This to me is an unsound as well as confused attitude. I would
    rather see a realization of the pressures, and a consciousness that it is within
    our power to deal with them.'

    <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t read Eichmann in Jerusaslem, and I am not an Arendt scholar.
    As I am aware, her term &#34;the banality of evil&#34; had a great resonance,
    to the extent of becoming a cliche. From what I have read of the commentary, including
    here, it appears that the connection she made between banality, fascism, bureaucracy,
    and not thinking for oneself made a lot of sense to a lot of people. To repeat
    one of John Hudson&#39;s points: she was contrasting the banality of evil with
    the sadism of evil. And at the time, when it was customary to demonize and project
    evil onto the other, her idea of describing evil as banal was a revelation. <BR>
    <BR>That is, because no-one had taken Eliot seriously when he wrote &#34;This
    is how the world will end. Not with a bang but a whimper.&#34; &#40;The Hollow
    Men, 1925&#41; <BR> <BR>In connection with typography, what could be more banal
    than a default choice of typeface, absolving the typesetter of any choice in the
    matter? <BR> <BR>If the default is a corporate standard, then it is a strictly
    bureaucratic banality. If it is made by the software, then it is another kind
    of banality: although the user is more at liberty to replace the default, how
    much freedom of choice is there really?  When a graphic designer buys a computer
    and installs professional software, already &#40;s&#41;he has a default library
    of typefaces which cleverly appears on the font menu. Of course, &#40;s&#41;he
    may still buy and install other fonts, but the default library is a coercive banality,
    no matter how marvelous the fonts may be, because it derogates freedom of choice
    by taking away the need to exercise it.  <BR> <BR>Is this evil? Of course not,
    because on the moral scale, evil is an extreme, and banal typography is merely
    a slightly numbing practice.  <BR> <BR>Is it inflamatory to speak of the &#34;banality
    of evil&#34; and typography in the same breath? Perhaps, but the moral dimension
    of banality is a genuine concern for many graphic designers and art directors,
    who are aware both of the ephemeral nature of their individual work and the problematic
    nature of the hyper consumerism which it promotes.'

    taste&#41; is exactly right. There was no question in Arendt&#39;s mind that Eichmann
    was evil, or that he tried hard to please his superiors by coordinating the movement
    and distribution of rail stock in order efficiently to move Jews to internment
    centers and finally to the camps, or that he knew where the Jews were headed.  <BR>
    <BR>William&#39;s secondhand reading of Arendt is wrong. Arendt never argued that

    tasks and promoting the reputation of his section of the bureaucracy from the
    gruesome reality of their function. The bureacracy was not to blame. She was making
    a larger point in the book about &#34;a new type of criminal&#34; who &#34;commits
    his crimes under circumstances that make it well-nigh impossible for him to know
    or to feel that he is doing wrong.&#34; Consider the other Nazis who spent the
    end days of the war destroying the records of their crimes; was this proof that
    they knew what they did was wrong? Far from it, she answers; it shows no more
    than that they knew they had lost the war and were aware of what others would

  body: John, thanks for the article, which is enlightening, and to my reading confirms
    very clearly one place where her theories themselves show moral cowardice.  <BR>
    <BR>As I said earlier, Arendt was very muddled. You can quote her saying many
    quite sensible and morally upright things. But also the opposite. And she never
    forthrightly sorts it out. This is a key to her popularity, in my opinion, as
    by staying muddled she is able to condemn the Nazis without ever appealing to
    liberal standards such as truth, democracy, protection of minorities and honest
    science.  <BR> <BR>Since many intellectuals, including Heidegger, were and are
    illiberal, this is a clever way to make herself and them them feel righteous without
    challenging their illiberalism.  <BR> <BR>Her quoting with approval Cicero saying
    he would rather be wrong with Plato than hold true views with people he doesn&#39;t
    like is exactly a point of betrayal of liberal standards.  <BR> <BR>The contrast
    here with Popper is noteable. Popper deeply admired Plato, but recognized his
    illiberalism, and so wrote his lengthy attack on Plato&#39;s illiberalism in &#39;The
    Open Society and Its Enemies&#39;. Of course Popper is not a darling of the illiberal
    and so not as popular.  <BR> <BR>However, it is he, and not Arendt, whom people
    in oppressed regimes have read as a beacon of light. When I was at the Popper
    Centenary conference in Vienna in 2002, it was very touching to hear how people
    in East Germany and Poland were strengthened and given hope and direction by reading
    Popper. And now he is being read in China and Iran by the champions of liberty.  <BR>
    <BR>The liberal standard is truth, and if your friend is supporting an evil, you
    don&#39;t go with him. And that by the way is not only a liberal standard, but
    a traditional Jewish and Christian one. <BR> <BR>My problem with Arendt isn&#39;t
    so much that she compromised her standards as that her standards were compromised.  <BR>
    <BR>Arendt tried to replace acknowledgement of the truth with another standard
    of &#39;thoughtfulness&#39;. But, as Miller also points out, this standard is
    also rubbish when applied to the Nazi situation. The Nazis were thoughtful. They
    had a whole system of pseudo-scientific racial theories that justified their actions.
    And exactly on point they had the &#39;great&#39; philosopher Heidegger endorsing
    obedience to the Fuehrer as justified by his system of thought. But they weren&#39;t
    honest.  <BR> <BR>Nick said earlier that cultural history is &#39;a bit smokey&#39;.
    Well not when I write it. I try to stick to real facts, and use them as a test
    of whatever I say. Understanding history of ideas is a very difficult and slippery,
    but important subject. I have been working in this field for forty years, and
    I try to follow what the great English liberal, Bertrand Russell, said on this
    subject. He said that he always tried to be as clear as possible. He understood
    that the truth often lay behind a fog of mystery and confusion, but he never took
    the fog for the reality, but rather strived to get through the fog to the reality.
    <BR> <BR>So I do strongly disapprove of those like Arendt who reject the standard
    of truth and generate fog, however beautiful the fog may appear at times.  <BR>
    <BR>Finally, I find rather peculiar, Nick, that you put family/lover in one category.
    What Heidegger did in having an affair with his 19 year old student, then dumping
    her, threatened his marriage and children, exploited her, and is morally reprehensible.
    Arendt&#39;s behavior of maybe getting her jollies by sleeping with a famous man
    with a wife and children is also wrong.  <BR> <BR>You could argue that Heidegger
    was more culpable than she, as he was the one with the power in the situation.
    But the idea that she owed him something because he exploited her for sex - or
    was it for gratitude for the priviledge of being screwed by a famous Nazi - when
    she was 19 seems to me grotesque.  <BR> <BR>Finally a note on one thing mentioned
    in the article John references. Greif notes that Arendt made something of the
    fact that Eichmann knew Kant&#39;s ethical theories. However Eichmann interpreted
    the &#39;categorical imperative&#39; as meaning &#39;do whatever the Fueherer
    would approve of, if he were in the same situation&#39;. Um, not exactly true
    to Kant, an apostle of liberalism and the enlightenment. And very much on point
    as to what motivated Eichmann, though minimized by Arendt.

    Nazis until 1933, and most of his anti-Semitism would likely have been kept delicately
    out-of-conversational-bounds during the time he and Arendt were together in the
    mid- to late 1920s.&#41; Was it wrong to have an affair with a married man? Yes.
    Does it contradict her later views on judgment and responsibilty that she downplayed
    Heidegger&#39;s flaws even in later life and never lost her devotion to his mind?
    Yes. Was she therefore a self-hating Jew, harlot, and home-wrecker whose ideas
    deserve no consideration? No, and it&#39;s pretty slimy to suggest otherwise.
    <BR> <BR>By the way: Arendt&#39;s take on Cicero means nothing close to what you
    take it to mean. Read Greif&#39;s article again--or, better, read Arendt&#39;s
    actual essay. Plato does not represent in that passage the &#34;illiberal tyrant&#34;
    &#40;Cicero would not have looked at Plato that way&#41;, and the differences
    between Plato&#39;s views and those of the Pythagoreans were not ones that Cicero&#39;s
    imagined characters could resolve with reference to the facts. Greif is using
    the passage as a metaphor for Arendt&#39;s moral cowardice on the question of
    Heidegger. Arendt, for her part, simply was arguing that when reason and facts
    fail, you wind up falling back on character, for better or worse. She was not
    saying that &#34;when I have to choose between being with a tyrant and being with
    people who tell the truth, I chose the tryant&#34;; she was saying, if anything,
    &#34;when I have to choose being right with people of poor character and being
    wrong with people of good character, I choose to be with people of good character.&#34;
    That  that position regarding Plato &#40;not hers, but Cicero&#39;s&#41; is questionable,
    and that she let her regard for Heidegger blur her own judgment of his character,
    in themselves takes nothing away from this point, arguable as some may find it
    to be. <BR> <BR>&#40;It&#39;s useful, by the way, to think of this in the context
    of what was to be the opening epigram to Arendt&#39;s book on judging, from Cato:
    &#34;Victrix causa Diis placuit, sed victa Catoni&#34; [the victorious cause pleases
    the gods, but the vanquished cause pleases Cato]--questioning, as I read it, the
    belief that alignment of one&#39;s views with power guarantees the justice or
    truth of one&#39;s beliefs.&#41; <BR> <BR>There&#39;s just no need to take these
    kinds of swipes at Arendt. Disagree with her, argue with her, but don&#39;t churn
    the swill like that.'

    that it somehow mitigated her later behavior. My point, and I acknowledge that
    my language should have been less angry, is that her behavior as a student in
    no way excuses her later behavior in relation to Heidegger&#39;s reputation. The
    term &#39;calumny&#39; implies that what I said is false. But it is true. I offer
    different interpretations of her affair, and I don&#39;t know what is correct,
    but whatever way you slice it it doesn&#39;t come out honorable.  <BR> <BR>I never
    said that she was a self-hating Jew whose views don&#39;t deserve consideration.
    They should be considered and rejected.  <BR> <BR>Miller&#39;s argument is not
    self-contradictory. He is pointing out that Arendt acknowledges facts that contradict
    her thesis, and she refuses to accept the implications of these facts, which refute
    her.  <BR> <BR>You say above: <BR> <BR>&#34;Nick and John&#39;s association of
    Arendt&#39;s &#34;banality&#34; with mindless action &#40;and not merely poor
    taste&#41; is exactly right.&#34; <BR> <BR>and &#34;she argued that he was a thoughtless
    functionary&#34; <BR> <BR>You say that my charactization of her view as Eichmann
    as a &#34;a thoughtless cog in a bureaucratic machine&#34; is somehow off base.
    How is my characterization different from yours?  <BR> <BR>Furthermore, you are
    not getting Miller&#39;s point. If Eichmann were just doing his job as a bureaucrat,
    then he would have done what his superior told him. But he went against it because
    of his fanatical devotion to Hitler, a motive Arendt minimizes, but which was
    primary.  <BR> <BR>More generally, you can distinguish between and weak and strong
    version of the banality thesis. The weak version is that Eichmann was a shallow
    and silly man, and not a demonic mastermind. Everyone would accept the weak version,
    including me. The strong version is that he was a &#34;thoughtless functionary&#34;,
    as you put it. The strong thesis is false as Eichmann thought about it, and wanted
    to do whatever Hitler wanted, whatever the moral consequences. Eichmann may have
    lacked a moral sense, but he was thoughtful to the extent that he knew what he
    was doing and why he was doing it - to carry out Hitler&#39;s dreams.  <BR> <BR>It
    is significant that, as Grief points out in the article John referenced, Arendt
    never made clear what she meant by the phrase &#39;banality of evil&#39;. This
    muddiness in what she is talking about is what I most object to. It enables she
    and her defenders so slide between different positions to avoid looking the facts
    about Eichmann in the face. <BR> <BR>It is muddle-headedness in defence of illiberalism,
    and its popularity, that I find objectionable.'

  body: William-- <BR> <BR>The rub here I think concerns the definition of &#34;thoughtless.&#34;
    You, and Miller, want &#34;thoughtless&#34; to mean &#34;accidental&#34; or &#34;inadvertent.&#34;
    On that reading, of course, Eichmann was not &#34;thoughtless&#34; at all. If
    anything, he was meticulous and even obsessive, a trait he shared with most of
    the Nazi leadership and bureaucracy. <BR> <BR>It might surprise you to learn,
    then, that Arendt, far from minimizing this, agreed with you, and documented this
    quality of Eichmann thoroughly in her book. To put that evidence against her as
    proof she was wrong about Eichmann is thus misguided; it doesn&#39;t &#34;refute&#34;
    her if she never argued to the contrary in the first place. Indeed, so far as
    I know, no one--not Arendt, not anyone--argues that Eichmann sleptwalked through
    World War II and the Final Solution, or that he was hoodwinked or brainwashed
    into genocide, or that he did not understand the consequences of his actions.
    <BR> <BR>As Arendt used the term, &#34;thoughtless&#34; meant &#34;ethically mindless&#34;
    or &#34;without judgment&#34;--that is, not thinking what one is doing, morally
    speaking. What Eichmann showed Arendt was that one can know what one is doing
    and why, yet simultaneously and without guile or irony proclaim contradictory
    and even pure motives, and even &#40;and monstrously&#41; express astonishment
    at the lack of gratitude from one&#39;s victims &#40;as Eichmann expressed of
    German Jewish leaders and of his captors&#41; for having done one&#39;s job so
    well.  <BR> <BR>For Arendt to point this out and trace the consequences of failing
    to recognize this phenomenon for our moral and political judgment is not at all
    &#34;muddleheaded.&#34; She is holding something ugly and troubling about the
    human condition up to the light for inspection. That she called this the &#34;banality
    of evil&#34; without quite being able to put her finger on its precise definition,
    or to reconcile it with her other accounts of &#34;radical evil&#34; and the nature
    of totalitarianism, shows only that she was struggling honestly with something
    complex but of great signifcance. <BR> <BR>This doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t
    potential problems with Arendt&#39;s account; it just means you and Miller haven&#39;t
    raised any of them by accusing her of minimizing Eichmann&#39;s evil.

    judgment&#39; these terms do not apply to Eichmann. He did believe in an ethical
    system, namely that of the Nazis, according to which it was good to kill Jews
    in order to purify Europe of racial pollution. He made an ethical choice, a horrific
    choice, but a choice none the less, and did it knowingly.  <BR> <BR>Also it is
    a grotesque irony that the person whom Arendt would probably have taken as the

    aesthetics, and I too have a day job, so let me say this in response to your post,
    and be done with it: <BR> <BR>Our disagreement, again, is over the definition
    of &#34;thoughtful.&#34;  <BR> <BR>If I consciously, in command of my facilities,
    with full knowledge of the consequences of my actions, support an anti-Semitic,
    pro-&#34;Aryan,&#34; fascist ideology of government and racial purity, and deliberately
    and meticulously in my bureaucratic support of that ideology design and carry
    out policies directly or indirectly to destroy Jews, Slavs, the Roma, gays, and
    others--AND THEN express genuine bewilderment at the lack of gratitude and appreciation
    for my efforts and my purity of motive from those victims or their survivors,
    as all of which was true of Eichmann--then to call me &#34;thoughtful,&#34; as
    you and Miller apparently insist upon doing in Eichmann&#39;s case, can be true
    only in the most trivial sense of exhibiting complex mental activity and concentration.
    &#40;To pick a more directly gruesome example: would you call Josef Mengele&#39;s
    medical experiments on Jewish prisoners, or the vivisection of prisoners by Japanese
    military surgeons during World War II, &#34;thoughtful&#34;? It seems perverse
    to do so: &#34;And then, Dr. Ishiyama thoughtfully anaesthetized the patient and
    removed part of his brain.&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>It was this monstrous combination
    of consciousness and thoughtlessness that Arendt witnessed of Eichmann and documented
    at the Jerusalem trial. Why you and Miller &#40;among many others, I&#39;m sorry
    to say&#41; continue to accuse her of minimizing Eichmann&#39;s monstrousness
    in the face of overwhelming evidence to contrary mystifies me. <BR> <BR>Moreover,
    in Heidegger&#39;s case, you seem not to want to believe that Heidegger made some
    important contributions to philosophy, but also made some grievous errors, which
    errors in combination with his clear anti-Semitism and authoritarianism became
    the basis for his virulent support for Nazism, and then his stubborn resistance
    after the war to accepting responsibility for his behavior, or indeed showing
    much if any remorse for it.  <BR> <BR>It is, after all, possible to find some
    things a person said and wrote &#34;thoughtful,&#34; and others &#34;thoughtless,&#34;
    --except, perhaps, again, in the most trivial sense of &#34;thoughtful,&#34; in
    which any activity that requires higher brain functions is &#34;thoughtful.&#34;
    &#40;For a recent example of the selective use of Heidegger, read Darin Barney&#39;s
    excellent Prometheus Wired, in which Barney uses Heidegger&#39;s ideas about the
    nature of technology to produce great insight into the consequences of digitizing
    and networking information.&#41; <BR> <BR>More to the point, you and Miller seem
    determined to believe that Arendt&#39;s love and friendship for Heidegger based
    on his accomplishments could not compromise and overwhelm her judgment regarding
    Heidegger&#39;s serious flaws &#40;or, more brutally, that Arendt could sleep
    with a brilliant scholar and authoritarian anti-Semite who turned her on to philosophy
    and later became a more or less unrepentant Nazi, and then afterwards display
    sympathy for him even in the face of his behavior and unrepentance&#41; without
    it also completely vitiating any and all of her later philosophical, ethical,
    historical, and political claims and judgments. &#40;How else to interpret &#34;Arendt
    is not trustworthy, or right&#34;?&#41; <BR> <BR>I just don&#39;t accept that
    reasoning, any more than I accept the reasoning that because her description and
    condemnation of Eichmann&#39;s monstrousness doesn&#39;t align with what many
    wanted and still want to believe about him, she must have been &#34;minimizing&#34;
    Eichmann&#39;s crimes. The conclusions simply don&#39;t follow from the arguments
    and evidence. If you think they do, then I guess we just have to agree to disagree,
    and leave things as they are. <BR> <BR>On another note: Erik is right about fascism--and
    I know this will get me into trouble with Hrant regarding Bush. It is possible
    to be authoritarian without being fascist &#40;or any kind of totalitarian&#41;.
    The former has to do with tyranny, self-interest, and subordination; the latter,
    with ideology and the self-abnegating worship of a nation, race, class, or religion
    as the vehicle of that ideology. The two may blur together in historical fact
    &#40;witness Soviet communism&#41;, and we may call the leaders of both &#34;dictators&#34;
    when the totalitarianism contains some kind of Fuehrerprinzip, but the distinction
    is important nonetheless, especially since IMH but I hope informed O totalitarianism
    is far more dangerous than authoritarianism.'

    recently read  a booky on the Nazi Reichssicherheitshauptamt by historian Michael
    Wildt (Generation des Unbedingten, Hamburg 2003). Wildt found out that Hans R\xF6\xDFner,
    the Editor-in-Chief at Piper Verlag in Munich at the time Ahrendt wanted to publish
    her book, had been one of the ideologists in the Reichssicherheitshauptamt III,
    Schrifttumsstelle Leipzig until 1936, when he left for a university career in
    Bonn (but remained in touch with the institution that was mainly employed in justifying
    and grounding nazi ideology).\r\nWildts publication reveals the correspondence
    between Ahrendt and Piper/R\xF6\xDFner relevant for the german version of <em>Eichmann
    in Jerusalem</em>: i.e. some passages in the text referring to nazis that returned
    to their previous bureaucratic jobs in the 1950s where criticised by the publishers'
    lawyers etc."
