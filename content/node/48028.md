  to use or the best way to approach it? '

  body: "Draw a storyboard.\r\n\r\nBuild \"construction\" first in a vector format
    in something like Illustrator or FreeHand. You can use a bold face and cut it
    into squares. You can also use a typeface if you want the blocks to bee seen in
    \"construction\" after the animation is completed but if you do it by hand that's
    better. There are typefaces built with rectangles but I can't remember the names.\r\n\r\nIf
    the output destination is web, you can use Flash, if it's TV or a kind of video
    format, you can use After Effects.\r\n\r\nTake \"construction\" into Flash or
    AE and scatter rectangles one by one to your taste. Then play the animation reversed.\r\n\r\nThis
    way you can have full control over the animation and it will look the way you
    want. There should be plugins to do it in AE but I don't know any. If you use
    a plugin, it will look default and will be similar to other animations out there."

  body: "A nice trick might be to use Underware's Unibody pixelfont, since its letters
    are made up of distinct blocks*, which makes it easy to individually remove the
    blocks. So you'd go \"backwards\" from a full rendering, removing the blocks step-by-step.
    And it's free.\r\n\r\n* Which is frankly a poor way to construct a pixelfont.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
