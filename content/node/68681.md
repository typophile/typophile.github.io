  in the wrong section.\r\n\r\nI am a graphic design student currently in my second
  year of my college course. One of our projects was to design a poster, ticket, invitation
  and envelope for an exhibition called \"Beauty all around us\". The exhibition is
  about typography in the environment and we were asked to experiment with legibillity
  and design showing the relationship between them. \r\n\r\nMy initial idea came from
  road/motorway signs and what they would look like without text, this then developed
  into using symbols in the typography its self to create the design below. This is
  the poster design. Any opinions, critiques or questions please feel free to share,
  and again I apologise if I am in the wrong section of the forum.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beautyallaroundus_01_5655.png]"

  body: "Given that it's a museum exhibit specifically about typography, I'd be worried
    that the use of Bauhaus would potentially deceive--given that Bauhaus was an art
    movement much larger than just typography. \r\n\r\nIn other words, in seeing this
    poster for a museum exhibit, I'd assume it's an exhibit feature works from the
    Bauhaus movement. \r\n\r\nThat's not to say your concept isn't sound. I'd stick
    with it. But try working on a type treatment of your own that isn't specifically
    using the Bauhaus typeface. "

  body: Yeah that's a good point, the reason I chose the font was because it best
    represented a road, the naturally curved nature of Bauhaus and some modification
    created a flow throughout the design.

  body: "The brief shouldn't matter, you should come up with what you think is right,
    if it isn't in your briefing, it's your own choice, so that's +1 for your solution.\r\n\r\nSince
    it's such a broad subject, and the briefing doesn't mention anything we should
    I think refrain from adding other types of 'enviromental' typography. \r\n\r\nFor
    your design, it bold, that's nice, but I would play more with the various glyphs,
    and especially some optical adjustments. For instance Beauty looks like it has
    run into a concrete wall with the 'uty' all pushed together, so bring 'Bea' closer
    together, or do some adjustments on the 'uty'. This doesn't have to be spacing,
    but you can also play around with the inner shapes, there is a lot of potential
    in the t-gap for that. Then again, 'around' looks too wide again, so try to bring
    it a bit together letterwhite-wise.\r\n\r\nI think the main issue is that you
    left the type too much as it was originally, the Bauhaus font, or was it mentioned
    in the brief that you could not edit it ? You should otherwise play around with
    the forms and make them really unique, and perhaps more flowing as a road without
    going back to the cliche Bauhaus typeface glyphs (especially the 'a')\r\n\r\nI'd
    also regrain from using the bauhaus type anywhere else on the poster aside from
    the title, in the small text it's way too black and closely spaced, making it
    hard to read.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm not sure of magenta, but then again I'm not
    from the UK so don't know which colors should be accociated with road signage
    or other road markings.\r\n\r\nDon't let my comments put you off though ! I like
    the road (excuse the pun) you took with this assignment, it works nicely and combines
    type and a message (or has the potential to)"

    none the less. Thankyou for the comment Arthus I appriciate the constructive feedback
    and agree with it all. The only main adjustment to the Bauhaus font was ading
    some curve shapes and draggin off the ends so like you suggested more playing
    around could form a stronger design along side with better letter spacing.\r\n\r\nI
    chose magenta because it was the colour which best stood out to me, I know that's
    not a good reason to justify the colour choice but I went with it anyway. Thankyou
    again for the feedback!"

    and loose in others. Find a way to even out the spacing between elements.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the 'U' in 'us' being attached to what's above it made it difficult to read at
    first. Focus on legibility more."
