body: "I am working on a project to design two sets of religious books. One set will
  be meant for travel, and one set would be meant to be used at home. Each set will
  contain 5 or 6 books, with an eclectic combination of prose, poetry, scripture,
  and artwork.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have examples they can share of well-designed books
  of this sort? I have seen some books designed by [[Bruce Rogers]], and I love his
  clean style and generous use of white space.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nMore information:\r\n\r\n<ul>The
  most important feature for both sets is reading comfort.</ul>\r\n<ul>These books
  are meant to be read several times each day.</ul>\r\n<ul>The travel set needs to
  be very compact and relatively inexpensive.</ul>\r\n<ul>The home set can be very
  ornate and expensive.</ul>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.unostiposduros.com/?p=1004\">\r\n<img

    the technical term for that is), 19th century letterpress, King James, set in
    a solidly leaded Scotch, very thin paper. It's a package alright."
