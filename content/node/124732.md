  I want to pair this with a slab font and found I liked Neutraface Slab.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem being is that House Industries still haven't got a webfont solution.\r\n\r\nI
  was wondering if anyone could share there thoughts on web available slab parings
  for Futura. \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance for your thoughts. Be gentle, this is
  my first post! ;)"
