  <BR>On the first image you see the finalists and on the next the logo  <BR>they
  choose, but they are not sure about the typeface.  <BR>I am pretty sure that the
  most of you are tired of Helvetica, as I am.  <BR>Beyond that I like  the combination

  body: Congratulations! I find the one with Tango and a &#34;smoke&#34; &#40;the
    one you have chosen&#41; GREAT! Clean idea, nice design. You could make a great
    animation of a smoke...  <BR> <BR>Maybe just the curve of a knife approaches too
    much the one of a fork. The white space could be lost at smaller sizes.

  body: I think the chosen logo is both interesting and well-composed, but it reminds
    me a bit of sperm... On the other hand, the &#34;s&#34; in Tango echos the shape
    so well! And Tango also contrasts well nicely with that lapidary Greek setting.
    And yes, do avoid Helvetica - it gives indigestion. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Very Elegant. The colors are as crisp vegetables and fruits. While I prefer
    the assymetry of the first composition, I also more prefer the type in the second.  The
    utensils seem to centered in a composition determined to be assymetrical. What
    if you rotate the utensils about 5 degrees counterclockwise and have them &#34;rising&#34;
    out of the space just above the last as combo? And I might perhaps thin the thickest
    bits up just a bit to more closely match the thick/thin variation in the letters.
    But, all that said &#40;not much I think&#41; this is very nice.

  body: I like the colors too. Juxtaposed with the lapidary greek they make me think
    of the multicolored pastas you can buy at the store. Yum. <BR> <BR>The Bernhard
    Tango letters look a little frail under the whispy silverware. I think Tiffany&#39;s
    suggestion of matching up the thicks and thins would help that.

  body: just a quick note. I haven&#39;t been following this, so  <BR>forgive me if
    this is old news. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d try pulling the right-most curve of the knife
    slightly  <BR>toward the fork and curve the top of the knife back to  <BR>the
    right. I think this will allow it to flow more smoothly  <BR>in the space between
    the fork and &#39;l&#39;. as it stands it is  <BR>quite nice, but my eye travels
    directly up the shapes  <BR>and gets stuck on the tines of the fork -- I assume
    you  <BR>want the viewer stuck on the name.
