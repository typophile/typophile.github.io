The printer claimed to not be able to open the file properly and that there wasn't any font files.( Which is rubbish because I included a pdf, id file and the fonts.) Anyway, they hashed it and swapped Times NR for my specified Vendetta, claiming that it &quot;pretty much looked the same&quot;. I didn't know until it was printed, and was livid to say the least. <BR> <BR>kris.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One good,  ne excellent, reason to examine your own film. I'm very used to doing my own film output, as we have the equipment in our offices.  <BR> <BR>Recently I had the press I use output the film for an oversized project and didn't think to examine the film. They gave me one of those new fangled digital proofs which I've had ZERO experience with &hellip; because again I'm used to examining my own film and having the matchprints made directly from the film. I wasn't aware that the stairstepping was actually not a result of the digital proof but actually in my illustrator file. (I am so used to outputting my own film and knowing what to watch for that I didn't know the red flags in this press's workflow.) <BR> <BR>When I went in to discuss the problem with the pre-press department they told me point blank that the problem I had had wasn't something they watched for &hellip;. ARGH! The problem, was of course, the file not being set to a high enough resolution. I hadn't run into this problem in sooooo long it took me by surprise.  <BR> <BR>I call it a lesson learned. I don't know how to calibrate my film, or test the calibration of processed film, I trust someone else to do that for me. But I know bad type and bad shape and incorrect overprint/knockout when I see it.  <BR> <BR>More on topic, not many foundries support embedding into PDFs, let alone for service bureau output. But, those that do should be applauded and rewarded (I don't know how).  <BR> <BR>One work-a-round that people should include to their service bureau &hellip; laser proofs. Even if you just give them composite prints. I would think that they wouldn't want to give you film that didn't work if you can show them how you know it should look in the end.</div>
