  this week and wanted to attempt a font.  Seems many of you are quite skilled at
  this, so would anyone care to let me know your thoughts on this one?  \r\nI'm open
  to anything - as i said, I know very little about this sort of thing."

    target=\"_blank\">Modula</a>', by Zuzana Licko.\r\n<em>( Well, I like it, but
    I just wanted to make sure that you 'know' about / are aware of 'Modula', as well.
    Maybe looking some more, and closer, at 'Modula' and its details, you can get
    some hints for your type design. )</em>\r\n\r\nThe characters that would slightly
    bother me are the 's', because it just doesnt quite fit in with the others and
    sure seems quite 'cut up'; and the 'e', maybe try to slightly lower the crossbar.\r\n\r\nDav"

      \ Still thinking about those and will take a look at Modula and see how it's
      S,K, and R look.\r\n\r\nScott Craig\r\nhttp://www.cancerbox.com | http:www.cancerbox.com/photoblog"

  body: "I like it. It looks fresh and there are some nice ideas behind it.\r\n\r\nBut
    you dont have to look at the letters itself but at how do the letters look in
    combination with others. The u and w for example looks really good but they dont
    fit in a word.  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fluid-u_5415.jpg]\r\n\r\nLook
    how much whitespace you get when typing those letters.    \r\n\r\nThe same problem
    appears to be in the r. Below the halfcircle is too much space.     \r\n\r\nThe
    lower horizontal bar of the t is too short    \r\n\r\nBye: Steven"

  body: "Thanks for the comments! \r\nYeah, someone else recently pointed \"Modula\"
    out to me as well.  I will take a look at this font and use it as a guide to sort
    of try and get my font to the end of illustration stages.\r\n\r\nSteven: Yeah,
    I think some of these charecters would require soem hardcore manual kerning...
    \ the L and the U, for example, could be kerned to the point where the bottom
    of the L and the tail of the U merged together.  In fact, this is somewhat my
    intention with this font.  Making some of the charecters merge together and flow
    in a \"fluid\" way.  Does that make sense?  But yeah, I totally see your point
    and can imagine the trouble it could cause for some.  \r\n\r\nScott Craig\r\nhttp://www.cancerbox.com
