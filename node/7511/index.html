<div class=commentbody>I don't want to sound nitpicky, but that's not an italic but a slanted FF Sari. <br> <br>As to how to distinguish Barmeno from FF Sari - basically you don't, <br>FF Sari is an improved (in minute details) and expanded Barmeno. <br>The major difference is that you support Hans Reichel by purchasing <br>FF Sari, while it will be <a href=http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html target=_blank> a little harder to face yourself in the mirror</a> after <br>buying Barmeno. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>Whoa! I did not realize Berthold were that persistant in their hunting. Even though I too had them on my back for a short while: <br>Trying to convert a Berthold Mac type 1 font to use on a windows computer I asked on the forum (might have been a stupid thing to do) how to do this properly. Berthold Tech immediately sendt me an email explaining that this was illegal and I was warned about this. So I didn't convert the thing. But soon after recieving the Berthold email I recieved an email which I assume also was from Berthold and a trap. It went something like this: <br>------------------------- <br>Heloooo I see you is seek on advice to converting of the font. This is easy thing. I help you. Send me email and I help faster. <br> <br>Binghur Sadhivaaatda (Or something similar.) <br>------------------------- <br>Sadly I have deleted the phony email. It was kind of funny. <br> <br>Maybe I was just being paranoid and that last email wasn't from berthold at all but still I found it strange. <br> <br>Anyways. Thanks for the link, Yves. <br> <br>MG <br> <br>ps: please delete this post if it breakes any ethic rules of the forum.</div>

One of the primary <br>objectives of Typophile is to educate, which we are doing as <br>we speak ... er ... type. <br> <br>BTW In case anyone didn't get the reference: Hans Reichel <br>is the designer of both Barmeno and FF Sari.

<div class=commentbody>Yves, I don't want to be picky either, but in the interests of strict accuracy that is a slanted <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/zzz_detail.html?sku=BQ90042001P1" target=_blank>Barmeno</a>, not <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/zzz_detail.html?sku=FF01109701P2" target=_blank>Sari</a>. The one rather clear distinction between those two fonts is that Barmeno has a straight-sided M (like the sample). The M in FF Sari has legs that are splayed. Sari does have an 'italic' according to the FontFont catalog, and Barmeno does not, so that is the other main difference I am aware of.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yves, it's so rare to catch you on even a little mistake, that I had to look twice to convince myself. <br> <br>After reading (again) the Berthold/Hunt story on Luc's pages, I really didn't want to plug their font, but we try to be accurate here, right? BTW, as you could see from my links, contrary to Luc's article, there is at least one other site (Phil's) that sells their fonts, although the pricing is identical, right down to the Packages which cannot be broken for individual font sales. <br> <br>Objectivity first, then Subjectivity, even though it's a hard rule to follow.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks to Mike for pointing out an actual difference between Barmeno and Sari. I had looked for differences (apparently not carefully enough) and didn't find any, hence my question. I also figured there was a back story given that Reichel published an (almost) identical font with a different foundry. And indeed there is a back story!</div>

<div class=commentbody>The main reason I knew about the M is that it is one of the 7 key letters in my <a href=http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html target=_blank>Sans Serif Font ID Guide</a>. The two characteristics I note are whether the legs are vertical or splayed, and whether the crotch (vertex) of the M reaches the baseline or not. This gives four possible M variations. <br> <br>Another difference is that the tail on the R is very slightly curved in Sari, while it is completely straight in Barmeno. The R is another of my key letters, with four variations based on the position and shape of the tail. <br> <br>So Barmeno has Style Codes of 31/37, while Sari is classified as either 31/38, or 31/62, based on whether you take the slight curve into account or not. <br> <br>Pardon me for dwelling on this, as I realize I may be the only one who cares about how I classify Sans Serif fonts.</div>
