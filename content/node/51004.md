  body: "Modena\u2026 Nice homage to my city\u2026 :)\r\nAt least (unlike me) you
    always manage to release them, in the end\u2026\r\n\r\nThe new site is great,
    Miles! I like it (and the logo!) a lot\u2026\r\n\r\nI have noticed the Ferox PDF
    with my old interview has two errors: my surname is mispelled \"Puccinini\" on
    the first page, and (despite the intentions) I have not released anything up to
    date with Rodrigo at Psy-Ops. So it should read just \"Emigre and Village\"\u2026\r\n\r\n"
