  body: well out of the two, I like the first logo. only because there is too much

  body: Also I think the lettering on the second logo is a good direction. you can
    make the swashes look more organic. perhaps by adding leaves, ect. <BR> <BR>IM

  body: Take the lettering of the second logo, loose the line, loose the circle, place
    the leaves above the type. <BR> <BR>See how that looks.

  body: if you&#39;re using different point sizes for the letters &#40;as in the second
    example&#41; i would tweak the letters to make them all appear to be the same
    weight.
