  body: Thanks Tamas, but although Ascender Sans Bold is close, it's not quite there.
    It's a lighter weight than the PropertyLive font, and the tails of the 'e' and
    the 'g' end in a horizontal. The 't' is very similar, though, which made me think
    that some of Ascender's other fonts might fit. Mayberry Pro ExtraBold is also
    close, for example, but the 'l' is very wrong.
