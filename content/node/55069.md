  love the logo.\r\n\r\nhere it is: http://theprodigy.com/index.php/the-prodigy\r\n\r\nand
  the album cover: http://freedancemusic.net/images/the-prodigy-invaders-must-die-2009.jpg\r\n\r\nnow
  i'm pretty certain the 'invaders must die' is lettering, but the bands 'logo' looks
  like ti could have been made in fontstrust and then skewed in illustrator or indesign.\r\n\r\ndoes
  anybody know?\r\n\r\nthoughts anyone?\r\n\r\ni really like the whole album art,
  i've got a special edition in a digipak with dvd."
