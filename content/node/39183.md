  started wondering if there are any other typefaces out there that have built a \"Co\"
  ligature.\r\n\r\nMy 5 year old son Connor has been writing his name with the \"o\"
  inside the \"C\" ever since he learned to write his name. We never showed him to
  do this, but he does it every time. I think it's cool that he has chosen to do this
  and am very thankful that his teacher hasn't decided to \"correct\" it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/connor_6171.jpg]"

    has it, and I believe that <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/kartago/>Kartago</a>
    does, too, though I can't be sure from MyFonts.

  body: "@ Guerella\r\n\r\nI am sure, its a typical (typocal) kind of merchandizing
    gene. From 1900 up to 1930 we find lots of ligatures like \"Co.\" and \"Cie.\"
    (both: Compagnie) in Germany.\r\n\r\nMay be, Connor has german roots? \r\n\r\nThis
    example is from\r\nPr\xE4gefest\r\nLudwig & Mayer, Frankfurt am Main\r\nErstgu\xDF
    1926\r\nEduard Lautenbach\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5664.jpg]"

    if the nature of business hadn't changed so much. \r\n\r\nIn place of the old
    mercantile organizations that presented themselves as grand and solid, we have
    companies promoting cute and cuddly brands today (Think Unilever)\r\n\r\nBtw,
    Connor might also have been influenced by this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CocaCola_3634.jpg]\r\n\r\n;)"

  body: "Hello, this is such an old thread but I would like to revive it.  I'm a beginning
    design student \"in over my head\".  I need a typeface with a \"Co\" ligature
    for a \"Construction Co\" logo I foolishly promised to make.  Both \"co\"s would
    be ligatured for a nice balance - you get the idea.  \r\nNeed something free or
    low-cost ... student budget.  Kartago recommended above is ok ... but $35 for
    one typeface ... exceeds my budget.\r\nHis name will probably be in one of the
    script typefaces that's popular now and \"Construction Co\" (with both co combinations
    as ligature) below the name in a plainer font.  \r\nAiming for that trendy \"vintage
    feel\" but not trying to \"overdo\" it, either.  Thank you for any advice about
    a free or cheap \"roman\" font with Co ligature."
