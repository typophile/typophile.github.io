  want to write a program which takes font name as the parameter and dumps every glyph
  in this font to a txt file\r\n\r\nlike    \r\n\r\nbool dumpEveryGlyph(string fontName);
  \r\n\r\n\r\nI am wondering if there is any API which can help me to do this? (.net
  API?  win32 API?)\r\n\r\nthanks very much "

  body: The tricky thing is that not every glyph in a font must have a code point
    assigned, that means these unencoded glyphs cannot be represented in a plain text
    file.

  body: "Jens is correct. You cannot dump <em>glyphs</em> into a text file because
    a glyph means exactly nothing. It's the code points that count, because these
    form the link between the ASCII (or Unicode) character code you want to display
    and the actual piece of graphic (the glyph) that's going to be drawn. It's extremely
    important to understand these concepts correctly before you are going to pull
    off some low-level trick as you are attempting.\r\n\r\n(This bypasses any Opentype
    niceties, but then again it should. Opentype features have nothing to do with
    codepoints -- well, at least nothing you could 'dump into a txt file'.)\r\n\r\nThere
    are Windows APIs -- you don't tell, which is a mortal sin, but I presume you <em>are</em>
    talking about a Windows program here -- that can return font information, but
    I cannot remember if I really ever bothered to get down with those. My own experimental
    program is firmly based on my grasp of the file format of Truetype and Opentype
    font files, so I can locate and extract the all-important <code>cmap</code> entry
    and work it out from there."

  body: "I see the request is from mainland China, where the preferred encoding is
    neither UTF-8 nor UTF-16 but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guobiao_code\">GB
    18030</a> and where the \"niceties\" of unicode may not be the main concern.\r\n\r\nIf
    you install ttx and apply <code>ttx -i -t cmap filename.extension</code> to your
    font file, giving the file <code>filename.ttx</code>, then the following Python
    code should give the desired text (on a single line) in <code>filename.txt</code>.
    Modifying the code to cut into lines, if needed, should be straightforward.\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nfrom
    xml.dom.minidom import *\r\nimport sys, re\r\n\r\nf=open(sys.argv[1])\r\nr1=re.compile(r'(.+)\\.ttx$',
    re.IGNORECASE)\r\nfoutname=r1.match(sys.argv[1]).group(1)+\".txt\"\r\nfout=open(foutname,'w')\r\n\r\ndoc=parse(f)\r\n\r\nencdng='gb18030'\r\n\r\nstr=''\r\ncmaps=doc.getElementsByTagName('cmap_format_12')\r\nif
    not cmaps:\r\n  cmaps=doc.getElementsByTagName('cmap_format_4')\r\nmaps=cmaps[0].getElementsByTagName('map')\r\nfor
    map in maps:\r\n  code=int(map.getAttribute('code'),16)\r\n  if code > 0x20:\r\n
    \   str=str+unichr(code)\r\nfout.write(\"%s\\n\" % (str.encode(encdng)))\r\nfout.close\r\n</PRE>\r\nOf
    course, 'gb18030' could be replaced by 'utf-8' or 'utf-16' or some other encoding.
    If you copy the lines above, save to some file, say <code>dmpcmap.py</code> and
    then execute\r\n<PRE>\r\npython dmpcmap.py filename.ttx\r\n</PRE>\r\nyou get the
    text in <code>filename.txt</code>\r\n\r\nThis was tested on a Mac with <code>python26
    @2.6.7_1+ucs4</code> on the font ST Heiti\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\nPS The code does
    not check the platform because on my Mac, there are fonts without a cmap for Windows
    and I wanted to get an output file. Also, the code is slow on large files.\r\n"
