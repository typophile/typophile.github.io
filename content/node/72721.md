  Ltd. To give you a little overview of who they are but without boring you too much,
  heres a brief description:\r\n\r\nNewly founded knitted products company Future
  Textiles Ltd is planning a future in technical textiles and is already developing
  and manufacturing products for healthcare and personal protective equipment (PPE)
  applications.\r\n\r\nFuture Textiles was set up in April this year by Aidan Tracey
  a former Remploy Manufacturing Director who has over thirty years knitwear manufacturing
  experience. In a national shake-up of its UK manufacturing operations, Remploy closed
  a number of factories earlier this year and Aidan purchased a group of thirty of
  the company\u2019s Stoll and Shima Seiki flat knitting machines in 5, 7 and 10 gauges.\r\n\r\nThe
  company currently manufactures a range of standard flat knitted products but is
  developing products for new markets together with a number of strategic partners.
  Current joint developments with University of Manchester spinout Engineered Fibre
  Structures Ltd, include flat knitted medical devices and a range of heatable knitted
  products for industrial and healthcare markets.\r\n\r\nFuture Textile\u2019s strategy
  is to develop new technologies and products with partners, which can be protected
  to deliver competitive advantage, whilst manufacturing in the UK. The company is
  open to discussions on collaborative product and market development.\r\n\r\nJust
  looking for any general feedback really - my logo isnt the final thing yet - just
  the first concept that i felt was worth working on. Havent decided on colours yet
  either so have left it in one flat colour (the company is british so was thinking
  of incorporating appropriate colours, if possible to do so without it looking tacky/cliche).
  Not entirely satisfied with the type - hopefully you can see what im trying to do
  - keep the x-height the same except for the uppercase letters - not sure it looks
  100% right though. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks
  :)"

  body: "Hay Rachel,\r\n\r\nMy first impression is that the letters don't work well
    together (maybe it's just me, but using upper and lower case letters randomly
    in a word seems wrong). Also, the logo seems a bit heavy for a textile company.
    I know this may be deliberate, referencing the machines themselves, but it's what
    I notice.\r\n\r\nThe bottmos of uppercase letters shaped like a needle are a nice
    touch though. I'd also be careful with the 'closed-ness' of the e's. Thay might
    close and look like crossed o's in smaller sizes (especially if the medium used
    for the logo is knitted, or thred).\r\n\r\nI have to say that the combined \"F\"
    \"T\" symbol is very nice. Conceptually. It also seems too heavy.\r\n\r\nJust
    my opinion."
