  both headings as well as body text. At the moment I'm looking for a serif typeface,
  maybe in italic to use for quotes, introduction texts and so on. If you have any
  thoughts on which serif that would work well as a delicate supplemant to Interstate,
  it would be very much appreciated.\r\n  "

  body: I'd suggest you consider the serif font as the body text and interstate for
    quotes and intros. Interstate isn't that easy on the eyes for running text.

  body: I know of a situation where a book designer was using Interstate and the author
    objected that it was too heavy. The designer switched the text to Walbaum and
    kept Interstate for the title/headings.
