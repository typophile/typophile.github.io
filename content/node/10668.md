    target="_blank">PMN Caecilia Bold</a>, but with a   <BR>single-storey &#39;a&#39;
    and modified &#39;e&#39; and &#39;h&#39;. Where&#39;s the    <BR>sample from?
    What book? How recent?  <BR>  <BR>BTW, please title your future ID topics with
    something  <BR>more specific and descriptive &#40;such as the text from the sample&#41;.

  body: Naw, Silica is very different. Hmm. How can I describe it?    <BR>It&#39;s
    something like taking an oldstyle serif, making it    <BR>monolinear and replacing
    the bracketed serifs with slabs.   <BR>   <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/bodoni-egyptian/?refby=typographica"
    target="_blank">Bodoni Egyptian</a> was built with a similar concept in mind.

  body: This is worse than having my fingernails pulled out one by one. I could&#39;ve
    sworn I&#39;ve seen this face before.  <BR>  <BR>Slightly short, cute a and a
    friendly e&#40;ye&#41;. It&#39;s all TOO familiar. <BR> <BR>It looks like a something
    informal to me.

  body: The basic design IS PMN Caecilia, there&#39;s little doubt about that. The
    skeletton, typical curves, shapes of the serifs... everything seems to point in
    that direction. My guess is this is some sort of Schoolbook version of PMN Caecilia,
    the typical changes in the design indicate this. <BR>Does anyone have contact
    info for Peter-Matthias, maybe we should just ask him?
