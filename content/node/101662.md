  cutter of type, came about in the early 20th century as a reaction to immense useage
  of the Ro9mm-Vilna typeface design used by most of literate Jewish world.\r\n\r\nPutting
  the religious motives behind of most Reform German Jews and their utter distain
  of their Orthodox and Chassidic cousins, the popular design of Fronk-Ruhl was invented
  in . see http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/masterfont/frank-ruhl/ and http://www.linotype.com/473134/FrankRuhl-family.html.\r\n\r\nMasterfont
  writes: \r\nAbout this font family\r\nDesigners: Hausman\r\nDesign date: 1936\r\n\r\nLinotype
  writes:\r\nFRANK RUHL FONT FAMILY\r\nDesigned by Frank+R\xFChl in 1936\r\n\r\nWho
  was Hausman?\r\n\r\nOf course, the version marketed by Tzika of Masterfont is not
  that which created in three weights by Linotype, cut in metal, and never digitized
  by for in PostScript/TrueType/Opentype as a scaleable outline typeface either with
  French bezier curves favored by Adobe, or (American) quadratic curves favored by
  Apple -\r\n\r\nthere are two other mathematical systems, created by Sir Dr. Sinclair
  of the UK, and an American Dr. Donald Knuth - each of latter pair not outlines typefaces
  at all. Rather, Dr. Donald Knuth, is a brilliant but more complicated system. Hence,
  his TeX system never became popular. Sir Dr. Sinclair made the other systems seem
  babyish in comparison, was greater than brilliant, and the horizontal axis by the
  vertical, and was the UK's answer to DOS, UNIX, the IBM PC, and the Apple. It was
  called the Sinclair QL (Quaturm Leap). This is another.\r\n\r\nThe original design
  differed, and Linotype's original designs improved upon that, too, and was digitised
  by FontWorld in 1993. It will appears as very advanced OpenType version, known as
  SuperType for use on Adobe InDesign CS 7.70 with the SuperType plug-in and SuperType
  script."

  body: "Don't get me, the original design of FrankRuhl was a tremendous contribution
    to Hebrew type design. Linotype created three weights of FrankRuhl by a then young
    Mat Carter, instilling genius into genius. When I met with Linotype's head of
    type in Germany, at their US headquarters, I was shown his magnificent drawings
    from decades earlier.\r\n\r\nIf Tzvika had them, he could make three new faces.
    I however created them for private use in 1993. I will post samples of them, for
    Tzvika and Boruch G., my friend, to drool over. :)\r\n\r\nThese Hebrew faces were
    the result of Mat's brilliant work on Times-Roman, as I explain shortly.\r\n\r\nThe
    head German type man, flown in at the expense of Linotype Germany showed me a
    special one of a kind poster. It showed Times-Romans in three weights or sizes,
    but at 144 point type. The most radical differences were in the w and the m. The
    W and M each have three vertical strokes, very close to each other. Mat redrew
    them farther apart at the three different sizes. So, the w or m at 6 point differed
    radically at 12 and 18 point etc.\r\n\r\nEven Adobe's Multiple Master technology
    could not address Mat's idea. After I digitized his version of FrankRuhl, I saw
    that Mat introduced this idea to the Hebrew world of type. But OpenType, either
    in Microsoft's graphical VOLT software, or in the more advanced Adobe DOS-like
    FDK, could not support Mat's idea.\r\n\r\nSo, together with Scott-Martin K., an
    outstanding substitute for Mat :), I decided to introduce SuperType, a quantum
    leap, like the short-lived QL was to Apple Macintosh, IBM PC (remember that Boruch?),
    and even UNIX the aging dino.\r\n\r\nThe QL had a UNIX-like OS, called Q-DOS,
    a easy to use interface, called Super-Basic, and hid the CPU in the fat keyboard,
    that had two (shitty) tiny tape drives too. Steve Jobs trembled - Oh no, Sir Sinclair
    ripped everyone off. Sir S. even invented a new type technolgy that to this day
    I can't understand yet...Scott, how did Sinclair do it. Clive, if you read this,
    email me a lesson in what you did.\r\n\r\nGetting back to SuperType, it is basically
    OpenType II, and is compatible with Adobe InDesign CS 7 and higher, and MS Word
    2000 and higher in a truncated way.\r\n\r\nSuperType takes the best of VOLT, FDK,
    is written in Python by those guys who brought you RoboFont. Hi!\r\n\r\nBasically,
    a font created in SuperType, or ST, automatically applies all rules of Hebrew
    grammar (yes, David, all), plus causes letters to have different dimensions at
    different sizes.\r\n\r\nHence, one FrankRuhl font will appear differently at 6
    point, 9 and 10 point, 12 point, 14 point, 18 point, and so up.\r\n\r\nAlso, Romm-Vilna,
    and Romm-Rashi, also appear differently at different point sizes.\r\n\r\nFor the
    first time in history, the entire Bible will appear with shva-na, komatz katan,
    and various different metegs. Furthermore, they will have an important commentary,
    called DASH (Dikdukei Shlomo), explain to Jewish child the rules of Hebrew in
    simple and easy to understand explanations, just Rabbi Adin (Steinsaltz) Even-Israel,
    and Rabbi Dr. Twersky, did in their great books."

    popular, but you're right that the original Metafont never became popular. But
    it wasn't so much because it was <em>complicated</em>, as because it specified
    typefaces by the movements of an imaginary pen rather than their outlines. Thus,
    it was suited to the creation of original typefaces, but not to digitization of
    existing typefaces."

  body: "The original Computer Modern font, useful as it may have been to get mathematical
    papers into some sort of printed form cheaply by computer, was indeed a failure
    by typographical standards.\r\n\r\nBut part of that was simply because Donald
    Knuth wasn't a professional type designer. Metafont may well have been an adequate,
    if limited, tool to design some categories of typeface - imitation Carolingian
    hands, blackletter, uncials, calligraphic faces, and so on and so forth."
