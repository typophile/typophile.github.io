<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm sitting here working with Adobe's release of Linotype Trade Gothic, and noticing that the [[kerning]] tables have some really awful spots. It's in some really obvious pairs, 1 and 0, J and u.
What fonts do you think have the best and worst kerning tables? I'm giving best to House Industries Ed family, and worst to a nasty old Akzidenz Grotesk that I think was one of the earlier releases from Berthold Types Ltd. </div>

<div class=commentbody>You say "text fonts", so:
1) Of the Ed set, only Brush <cite>might</cite> qualify.
2) AG doesn't. Not nearly as bad as Helvetica, but still no serifs.
3) It's difficult to beat Mrs Eaves on the "worst" end, even though its letterforms are so superbly appealing; it's the ravishing, elegant woman with a terminal speech impediment.

<div class=commentbody>Ed Interlock isn't so much kerning as glyph substitution, so you might eliminate it.
I assume your criteria are not numbers of pairs, but appropriateness and completeness? Some typefaces need very light kerning, so the number of pairs is low. Some apparently simple ones need a lot.
I remember doing print production in the '90's, having to use Univers Condensed Light (from Adobe, maybe?) every day, at tiny sizes and remarking that it appeared to have NO kerning. Can you think of examples of bad kerning that's worse than no kerning? </div>

<div class=commentbody>I was looking a a ripper design that a mate was doing and it was a font of Granjohn, the letters were spot on but the kerning was rough as guts!

<div class=commentbody>Not exactly OT, but I will nominate two metal fonts that have superb fit in spite of lack of kerning.
The winner, I think, is Zeno. The best easily accessible example is the page from The Four Gospels, reproduced in "Account of the work of a hand press".
And the runner-up is Kennerly Old Style, by Fred Goudy. This is the face used in his book, "The Alphabet," and I think there are quotes from him about how he tried explicitly to design it so the serifs would connect visually with each other and there would be a flow.
In both of these cases, it's not immediately apparent to me what makes the fit so much better than average, but I haven't (yet) spent the time to really study the interactions between letterforms in depth.
In any case, I'm still looking forward to what people have to say about digital releases. I'm reading "Children of the Lamp," by P. B. Kerr, to the boys now, and it's set in Mrs. Eaves. I repeated Hrant's quip to them and asked them whether they agreed, but I don't think their typographic sense is <em>quite</em> that refined yet. In any case, that's a face that I think doesn't quite work in a book.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Raph, cute.
BTW, have you seen Dan Carr's Cheneau? It's a digital font made to emulate a metal one, with no kerning, intended to show that you don't really need kerning. As far as I'm concerned it shows no such thing, but presumably it's spaced very carefully (especially since Dan actually cuts metal fonts).
