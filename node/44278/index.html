  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was for one reason or other lead to a message board for the band Muse, wherein the discussion was someone asking for the font Muse uses for their logotype, which is frutiger:

http://board.muse.mu/showthread.php?t=2591

The conversation quickly turns to people requesting / offering to share the font files with others. This prompted me to sign up for the message board just so I could post a little comment (at the end) about font awareness. I was rather disturbed by such a blatant violation (especially by the second to last poster who seems to have posted it Frutiger for download). Has anyone come across stuff like this before? It would seem to me that it's like trying to bail the titanic out with a teaspoon. If so, what measures do you usually take?

Anyway,  none of these people will be likely to read (or care about) my comment because the thread is from a while ago.

I'm sure this happens in lots of places, and you're right that its tough to fight against.
I'd think that if the font file was actually posted on the boards, depending on the site, you could report that post as abuse and ask the administrators to take it down, since it's essentially promoting software theft.

I guess you instill respect for digital media when you can download a song of itunes for a dollar. To the uninformed, it's not so far fetched to not understand type costs a lot more. I guess the number of replies to this thread suggests that nobody here is all that surprised.</div>

Downloading a song for a dollar is not a problem. The problem is that most music is downloaded free. I asked my college class of 30 students on Tuesday if anyone had ever downloaded and paid for a song. They acted like I was crazy. To them songs are free and only crazy people would pay for them.

All iTunes does is allow those people who don't want to steal music a chance to do so.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wasn't really saying that Itunes is a problem. Itunes is my sole source of music purchases. Logically, a thirteen dollar with thirteen tracks comes out to about that. I was more or less saying (albeit unclearly) that if the maximum you would ever pay for a song was a dollar, it's hard to see a teenager willing to pay even $20 for one weight. I mean to say, that they probably have no indication of the work that goes into a typeface, or it's net worth (i mean OBVIOUSLY a single song by My Chemical Romance is worth more than a "stupid" font).

Please read that sentence with a sarcastic tone.

The node recently created about Letterhead Fonts indirectly leads to this instance, which is a much worse violation than I seem to have found:
http://www.gfxworld.org/fonts/new_fonts_5.html


I guess the summation of this thread is: They're kids, and what harm can they really do? There are bigger fish to fry. Okay, I agree, but i think it's still death by 1,000 cuts to some degree.</div>

Except that it's not. Maybe 1 in 50 folks would have paid for the font had there been no other way to get it.

I understand the reaction, but one needs to realize that it's rarely, if ever, a direct 1 to 1 correlation between lost sales.

"Itunes is my sole source of music purchases."

Eww. DRM is bad. ;o)

iTunes is my last resort only if eMusic and Amazon don't have the DRM free version. </div>
