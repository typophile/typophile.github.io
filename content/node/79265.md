  body: Grepping through Letraset books might work. Odessa LET is similar except for
    its AvantGarde-like look.

  body: "I got a hi-res scan from Rookledge's but the specimen goes right to the gutter
    so it is not ideal as it bends round the page. I am going to use that for the
    project pitch and see where I end up.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any alternatives (T\xE9
    mentioned Odessa for example) that would be great. Even better if they are available
    digitally."
