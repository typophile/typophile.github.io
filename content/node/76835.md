  body: Brilliant! When I saw the title of this post, my first thought was a boustrephedon
    style, which didn't make much sense as far as saving paper, but this is ingenious,
    because the reader can easily ignore the vertical lines while reading the horizontal.

  body: They don't seem to mention it there, but postage fees were the reason for
    this. You can see the stamp on that first sheet. Back in those days postage was
    very expensive and was charged per sheet sent. So that method of bi-directional
    writing was developed to reduce what, at that time, was a significant expense.

    (two diagonal).

  body: This letter was written ten years before the world's first adhesive postage
    stamp, the Penny Black, was issued. However, when you consider that, at the same
    time, quarter farthings (one-sixteenth of a penny) were in circulation, spending
    a penny (not to be confused with "spending a penny" for a public loo) was a big
    deal...

  body: "The Archimedes palimpsest is something different, as the vertical direction
    was erased, not meant to be read. Parchment was expensive, and they figured, this
    old stuff is not as important as another prayer book. So they scratched off the
    letters on an old parchment, rebound it at right angles and re-used it to write
    something else, in this case a prayer book. In 1908 a scholar figured out that
    the scraped-off letters were the only surviving manuscript of Archimedes' original
    account of how he made his discoveries. It is mind-blowingly brilliant and innovative,
    and probably the greatest discovery in history of science. Now, with infra-red
    photography, I think they are able to read the whole thing.\r\n\r\nMichael: great
    idea. I have a feeling we are going to see some more of these from you\u2014at
    least I hope so!"

    but with content.\r\nMore abstract than Zapf.\r\nAlso reminded of Scher's maps
    -- have you though about doing these on canvas, for gallery megabucks?\r\nAnd
    posters for further monetization."

    the middle of them. I did a series of over 20 clocks in the early part of the
    decade. These 4 were some of my favorites, simple, lots of texture, fun and they
    seemed to get past the usual reaction of: oh, they are only letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/time_4753.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    they weren't so anemic they would probably make great tiles.\r\n\r\nThis one is
    called time and the previous was Alphabet."
