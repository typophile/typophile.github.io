body: "I have been busy recently with trying to find out what goes in the market of
  Custom Typefaces. A collegue asked me to make a typeface for him from his logo.
  So he wants a price from me. \r\nIt's not easy to find out what reasonable prices
  are for creating custom fonts. And then the licences. Does the client want it exclusive,
  and if yes, for how long. There seem to be different licences for magazines, corporate
  material, websites, etc. etc. \r\n\r\nThe question I hear very often is; \"Why should
  we pay for an expensive licence when I can just buy the font for 40 dollars?\" \r\nGraphic
  designers buy more often single fonts or families. They very often use them for
  different projects, not just the one they bought it for. If they decide to use later
  on it in a magazine they go \"why not, I bought it already\".\r\n\r\nMy question
  is; should they contact the licencor to discuss the licence for using this particular
  font in a magazine? Or can they just use it? \r\n\r\nCan anyone shed some light
  on this?\r\n\r\nThnx,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n<strong>Also tired of Helvetica?</strong>

    he wants. What foundries are most concerned about is how many machines the font
    is being used from, not how many copies of a product will be produced.\r\n\r\nWith
    Myriad, or almost any other big name font, you can either design a logo, so set
    text in a book that will be sold 10 million times. Doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nBut,
    you are of course free to stipulate other conditions in your EULA. If you want
    to charge an extra licensing fee for certain projects and/or print runs, go for
    it. But you may need to come up with a good marketing concept to explain your
    reasoning to designers\u2026\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "If the license were to include exclusivity for a certain amount of time,
    of course, $40 isn't enough to pay for that. However, if a foundry were to shoot
    themselves in the foot and not allow the basic EULA licensee to include use in
    a book without paying extra for a fee, the foundry deserves what they get. Which
    I would think would be fewer/no licenses purchased. And I'm talking printed book,
    not PDF book for resell, I can understand, perhaps, additional fees for that as
    well.\r\n\r\nOr am I misunderstanding."

  body: "Careful what you compare: An Ad agency that wants to distribute a font to
    300 designers worldwide isn't paying $40. They need to pay for a license for each
    workstation, and that amount grows if they add workstations. Though most foundries
    offer quantity discounts, agencies routinely discover the cost effectiveness of
    custom type, especially if they will have it exclusive from its inception. Custom
    type allows them to own the font (forever, or just for a few years), without any
    additional cost in licenses.\r\n\r\nThe gray area being introduced by embedding
    issues has got a lot of people thinking that fonts are like repro art. When you
    sell a font, as long as the license is agreed on and paid, typically the foundry
    can't tell the licensor what to do with the font. How would that be policed? In
    every other type format, once you got the font (discs, strips, matrices, etc)
    into your shop, you could use it for as much or as little as you want. This may
    be repetitive, but printed copies of a document are not equivalent to digital
    copies of a font. When a magazine uses a font, they have a license to use it every
    month, for everything, big and small.... If they choose to use it for headings
    on 4 pages, that doesn't make it cheaper for them. It's like a chair: put plastic
    on it and forbid anyone from sitting in it, or use it every day for decades. You're
    paying for rights, not actual uses. I can't tell the La-Z-Boy slaesman I should
    pay less because I'll only be putting plastic on it and looking at it. "

  body: "I see it the same, but I think the biggest problem is verification. How can
    a foundry check whether the purchaser is telling the truth? If you licence a font
    for a magazine you know that that isn't done on one workstation. But would you
    sue someone for that? \r\nVery often the graphic designers descide what font to
    use. I've been in the business for 10 years now and I haven't heard any graphic
    designer talking about an expensive licence, simply because it's not worth it
    to the client. They expect all fonts are standard on the PC. Verdana will do just
    fine. \r\n\r\nI think the whole font licencing business is a gentleman's agreement.
    I wish there were more gentlemen so there were less font piracy. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Also

  body: "If someone licenses a font from a foundry, and then installs it on 100 computers
    instead of five, I don't think that there is any way for a foundry to be able
    to know that yet.\r\n\r\nFoundries do tend to trust their customers, though. And
    very often, five-seat licenses are upgraded by larger businesses, who more often
    than not want to be legit in terms of computer licensing. I mean, I think that
    Microsoft does check large companies out. So, while going through the process
    of cleaning up their apps for an MS audit, I suppose that some businesses will
    get all of their ducks in oder, even though MS probably couldn't care less if
    anyone's Adobe fonts weren't properly licensed.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    font you could offer an unlimited user # in the license ( unlimited # of computers
    inside the company ). I don't know if that is typical. If you did do this then
    perhaps you can remind the company that at 1000+ users the license for a '$40.00
    font' is way more that $40. Then you can go back and compare to your exclusive
    use + unlimited user size to indicate value. \r\n\r\njust an idea. \r\n\r\nWhat
