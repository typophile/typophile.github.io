		<div class="commentbody">I like it. And I like it that you're not roping yourself into a single color combo. <BR> <BR>One nice thing about the word &quot;tart&quot; is that it carries at least three connotations (in English) that I'm aware of &ndash; the sour flavor, a pastry, and a hooker. That gives you a lot of edginess. Good stuff!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the name, but not the typeface. This begs for something a bit more fun and a bit more display-oriented, rather than typesetting-oriented. A bit more geometric and a bit less industrial gothic. The design seems aimed towards the fun and friendly, but the type is pulling it in another direction. <BR> <BR>Personally, I don't think the mark is such a big deal, but it definitely doesn't say 'this is a tart' to me at all, but if you both agree that this is a visual element that captures the essence of your studio, then convention be damned. If you'd like it to be more accessible, perhaps you should do something with crust and filling. Right now it looks like a bite, but the bite and the tart edge read as the same thing, which confuses both. Here's a photograph of a <a href="http://www.proppersource.com/images/foods/tart-rasp.jpg">stage prop tart</a>, which could be a good model for judging proportions of various details, since stage props are designed to read from a distance. <BR> <BR>That said, it's a good sTart. (I couldn't help myself.) You've got an intriguing concept to work with.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">How about if only the &quot;T&quot; in tart were reversed out of the cloud shape and the &quot;art&quot; would stay black?  This would make a double meaning with the word ART so that it would read &quot;T&quot; &quot;ART&quot; as well as TART.  The &quot;T&quot; could mean typographic, TEAMED (since there are 2 of you), or suit you to a &quot;T&quot;.  The ART would refer to your business function, an art/design studio. <BR>It would still be fun and playful but at least give the viewer a hint as to what you do.  As it stands now, it could mean anything from a florist toi a baker. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>
