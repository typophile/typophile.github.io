    was made with a font? I'd guesse it is custom.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "Sorry, no I don't know.\r\nI'm mainly concerned with the upper case letters,
    I can make the rest of it work with another font. I've hunted through everything
    I can think of and no matches or even anything close enough, help, please?"

  body: "That's a tough thing to match because it's hand-drawn and not a font. You
    might be able to play with a script font, or even an italic sans font, and extend
    or add the connectors to try to make it resemble this. You may find you can re-create
    it easier by tracing it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega "

  body: "Can anyone point me in the direction of something close. Tracing it is doable
    but without a sample I'm lost. The four upper case characters I need are G B R
    C and without something to trace from I'm stuck.\r\nAn exact match isn't necessary,
    but a close starting point would help.\r\nI'll keep hunting until the pro's point
    me in the right direction.\r\nOh did I mention I'm new to this?"
