body: I&#39;d like to get some feedback on this.  This is a low-res version of a 300
  dpi file, intended for T-shirt screen printing. Let me know what I can improve.

  body: I am going to have to agree with Hector about the g. <BR> <BR>Have you thought
    of drawing the stealths as vectors? Sometimes photos on tshirts look kinda funny
    imo. <BR> <BR>I do like the composition of the planes though, how it gives the
    feeling of one being under the other.

  body: I don&#39;t think you should outline that mark in the background. simplify
    it and it will act more background and less like it is trying to be the center
    of attention. I guess my problem is hierarchy, there is not enough division.
