  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello, as quite a few of you know, I have been working on religious and classical reprints recently. I am trying to find a good logo to put everything under at this point. I have a few ideas.</p>
<p>First, the proposed title of my little project is &ldquo;Antiquae Litterae Foederi Arcae&rdquo; or ALFA for short. This translates to &ldquo;Time-honored Letters for the Ark of the Covenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The structure of the logo I have thought of so far is this: the letters ALFA in some kind of roman face in front of a light grey Fleur-de-lis (a traditional symbol of the Virgin Mary, the Trinity, and Christ). I am uncertain as to which face to use, or even if this idea is any good.</p>
<p>The project focuses on reproducing Latin-language classics, and some of the projects highest on the list include an edition (with long vowel notation) of the Aeneid and an edition of St. Augustine&rsquo;s Confessions - appropriate, I think, as Augustine admired greatly Vergil.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sounds like an interesting idea; how would it be different from the existing projects in this field (Loeb and so forth)? Adobe Jenson might work: it&rsquo;s a nice, sturdy humanistic type that actually works in digital form.</p>
<p>I might suggest that you make the name &lsquo;arcae foederis&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s much more common usage. (After a quick search, the only two instances I could find of &lsquo;foederis arca&rsquo; in its various forms were humanistic Latin, and one of these was due to the metre.) Of course, &lsquo;litterae antiquae&rsquo; would also be the usual order, though this would be too easy to read as &lsquo;antiquae arcae&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The reasoning for the order of Foederi Arcae is due to the Litany of Loreto - it is meant as a reference to the Blessed Virgin. Keeping the words in the same order as the Litany brings a clearer reference to the Litany. That was my reasoning, at least.</p>
<p>(you must pardon my unusual ordering - if it is grammatically correct, I tend to be fairly free with word order in Latin)</p>
<p>Unlike Loeb, I do not intend to provide translations. I intend for no English anywhere in the texts. Loeb, I noted, also does Greek texts, my project does not, at least for now.</p>
<p>There will probably be a few custom works (like an entirely Latin-language prayer book - I have seen only one produced in the last 150 years) included. I may make a distinction between the Roman projects and the Christian projects in this effort, but I am uncertain of that as of now.</p>
<p>I am also wanting to use a particular style of typography throughout. I am quite partial to the Classicist style (also called Modern or Didone), while I also like some moderate decoration. I do not think fusing the two would work well, however (except maybe with an early Bodoni? The only one I know of is ITC&rsquo;s remake). In short, I want editions that both are beautiful in what they say but also in how they appear.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
