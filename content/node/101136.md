  as \u2018Green\u2019 - doing home tours on bikes, recycled paper, donating a portion
  of their fees to non-prof's in Denver, CO, etc.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a font for
  the word \u201CConscious.\u201D\r\n\r\nAny suggestions you can offer would be great.
  \ I\u2019m posting what I have put together so far but I don\u2019t like the font
  used for \u201CConscious.\u201D"
