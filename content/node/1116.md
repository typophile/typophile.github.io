  body: 'Well, context always helps. Like in choosing that &#34;secondary typeface&#34;.
    But... <BR> <BR>- The hole in the &#34;ra&#34; needs help. You can&#39;t tighten
    the letters up too much more, but you might extend the beak of the &#34;r&#34;
    further down &#40;be careful of making it look retarded though&#41; and/or you
    can extend the right side of its foot serif. You might also try taking the beak
    of the &#34;r&#34; over and above the &#34;a&#34; &#40;like in the original Cheltenham&#41;,
    assuming that much flair suits the client. <BR>- The &#34;g&#34; is standing out,
    the way binocular &#34;g&#34;s tend to do during deliberative reading. You might
    not have to go to a monocular form, but it&#39;s gonna have to become much more
    straight-laced. <BR> <BR>Secondary typeface: although I don&#39;t like Futura,
    it might work here. <BR> <BR>Oh, and your thin vertical bar will have to change
    weight <BR>with the size the logo is rendered &#40;or actually, viewed&#41; at.

  body: I&#39;ve adjust the a to be a bit more symmetrical to the r, not sure if I
    gained much. I also extended the foot of the r per your recommendation, it&#39;s
    subtle but helps a little.  Also, increased the stroke of the line. <BR> <BR><img

  body: Thanks for the heads-up David.  I was under the impression that if the trademark
    is in a different market or industry, then it&#39;s fair game.  For instance,
    McDonald&#39;s lawn care can be trademarked.  McDonald&#39;s hotdogs would have
    problems. <BR> <BR>Was I given bad information? <BR> <BR>Nathan

    from suing McDonalds Lawn Care for the hell of it. <BR> <BR>I heard over in Scotland
    that a lot of people using the McDonald name are being hit with law suits if they
    use it for their businesses...it&#39;s their name too!  Gotta love multinational
    corporations.

  body: 'Sure, makes sense.  A company like McDonald&#39;s can afford &#40;and likely
    needs to afford&#41; lawsuits to prevent the dilution of their brand. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    not sure if the same is true for the aforementioned company in question. <BR>
    <BR>Here&#39;s some more info that I found on the subject: <BR> <BR>Copyright
    infringement requires &#34;substantial similarity&#34; of protected elements,
    whereas the test for traditional trademark infringement is &#34;confusing similarity.&#34;
    That is, the test for trademark infringement asks whether the ordinary buyer --
    not looking for subtle differences or fine details -- would believe both products
    &#40;or services&#41; came from the same source. The key to trademark infringement
    is &#34;likelihood of confusion,&#34; i.e., whether two marks are sufficiently
    alike to cause consumer confusion as to their source or origin. Courts consider
    the following factors in determining likelihood of confusion:  <BR> <BR>1. Similarity
    of the conflicting marks;  <BR>2. Relatedness or proximity of the two companies;  <BR>3.
    Strength of the senior users mark;  <BR>4. Marketing channels used;  <BR>5. Degree
    of care likely to be used by purchasers in selecting the goods;  <BR>6. The &#34;second
    comers&#34; intent in selecting its mark;  <BR>7. Evidence of actual confusion;  <BR>8.
    Likelihood of expansion in product lines  <BR> <BR> <BR>TIP: To constitute trademark
    infringement, the two marks don&#39;t have to be exactly alike -- just confusingly
    similar. Unlike most things in life, close is good enough. Under the Trademark
    Dilution Act of 1995, which became law in 1996, the owner of a &#34;famous&#34;
    trademark can now stop someone from using its trademark if it tends to weaken,
    blur or tarnish the famous mark. Unlike traditional trademark law, which still
    applies, with trademark dilution you do not have to show any likelihood of confusion
    over the source or sponsorship of the goods or services. Trademark dilution is
    described in greater detail later in this article. <BR> <BR> <BR>Trademark Dilution  <BR>
    <BR> <BR>Trademark dilution refers to the whittling away of a famous trademark&#39;s
    distinctiveness through unauthorized use. Under federal trademark dilution law,
    the owner of a &#34;famous&#34; mark is entitled to stop another person&#39;s
    commercial use of its mark that dilutes, blurs or tarnishes its &#34;distinctive
    quality.&#34; Unlike traditional trademark infringement, neither likelihood of
    confusion, nor competition between the parties&#39; goods is required.  <BR> <BR>
    <BR>What the federal trademark dilution statute does &#40;15 U.S.C. 1125&#40;c&#41;&#41;
    is make parody and satire, especially in advertisements and commercials, a high
    risk endeavor. For example, where there&#39;s a negative or unwholesome connotation
    about a &#34;famous&#34; mark, courts are likely to enjoin use.  <BR> <BR>TIP:
    Trademark dilution only applies to strong marks. Dilution can occur when a well-
    recognized mark is parodied in an advertisement, even if there is no likelihood
    of confusion1.  <BR> <BR> <BR>'
