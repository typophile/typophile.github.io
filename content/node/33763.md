  body: "kern2VOLT is part of MS VOLT distribution. It allows font designer easily
    convert existing kern table into file containing kerning data in VOLT lookup format.
    Once lookup file generated, it can be imported into VOLT project through \"Import\\Import
    Lookup\" menu.\r\n\r\nCommand line for kern2VOLT is following: \r\n\r\n  <code>kern2VOLT
    [-rtl] fontfile.ttf kernlookup.vtl</code>\r\n\r\nFontfile.ttf should contain kern
    table and VOLT project sources. VOLT project is required because kern2VOLT needs
    to get glyph names from there. kernlookup.vtl is name of the output lookup file.
    -rtl is optional, you would use it to get correct data for right-to-left scripts.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey\r\n\r\n"
