  body: I would suggest hanging the quotes in the headline and dropping Ever to the
    next line. Perhaps right rag the body copy (personal preference) or make sure
    the copy is all flush, including the last line if you are going to justify (hanging
    punctuation here too.) The 2nd to the last line in the body copy looks a bit loose,
    right rag would fix this.

  body: "\"Whether you knew the Greatest Poet or not, come and see how today's emerging
    talent have taken inspiration from them.\"\r\n\r\nDo you mean \"them\" as in the
    Greatest Poet? If so, this is ungrammatical. \"Him\" or \"her\" would be appropriate;
    sadly, English has no gender-neutral singular 3rd person pronoun. Also, is there
    a reason the final \"All welcome\" doesn't have any punctuation? Finally, I think
    the period of the first sentence should go within the quotes.\r\n\r\nIt looks
    like you already have a slight drop shadow behind the text, but I kind of think
    that the word \"poetry\" in \"roundhouse poetry\" needs a little more to set it
    off from the white flowers in the background. Particularly at the top of the P.
    That's a bit subjective though, and I don't think I can be sure without seeing
    a print. Oh well, just a thought...\r\n\r\nMy eye also tells me that the URLs
    at the bottom ought to be either centered with the circular logos or flush with
    them at the bottom. Again, rather subjective. And I'm a noob, so take it with
    a grain of salt!"
