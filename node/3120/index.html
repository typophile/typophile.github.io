		<div class="commentbody">Kent <BR> <BR>I am a left-handed calligrapher, so I am not really a calligrapher atall, but I think the sample you show would make a font with some effort. <BR> <BR>I seems to me that the flourish on the ascender of the d could be a separate character (in fact, there could be a partial &quot;extra&quot; sorts font of flourishes) that could be place by baseline shifting and tracking into position, or  just straight finialled letters like the k. <BR> <BR>It's also likely that there should be flourishes below the baseline as well. Aditionally there could be starting and finishing swashes that could be places without looking like they'd been paste-potted in. <BR> <BR>It would be a real challenge, but I think very possible. If you take a second look at how separate the flourish really is from the lowercase d. <BR> <BR>If the caps were drawn intentionally large as the sample, there would be little need top scale up or down more than few%, so that there would be no obvious variance in weight. <BR> <BR>You would need to work closely with somebody who has a good calligraphic wrist. Are you on speaking terms with Julian Waters? <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It might be possible to create a font that looks similar to this in certain ways, but part of the charm of lettering like this is the fact that each character is unique, created for and taking advantage of the specific location it occupies in the whole.  <BR> <BR>You can approach it somewhat (as with Zapfino), but it is something that is ultimately beyond the limits of typography as it exists. Characters in fonts need to be created in such a way that they will work acceptably in a practically unlimited number of unknowable combinations. Characters in lettering like this only have to work in one specific known combination. It's a big difference and the one that really defines the line between lettering and typography.</div>

You would need to consider 2 or 3 different versions of each character, plus all the varieties of swash beginning, ending, up, down plus a selection of flourishes. It is something I've been considering &amp; rejecting for some years. I don't mean to be discouraging, but there is a mountain of work to achieve something that, eventually is (possibly) self-defeating. <BR>Tim</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Poetica, handled well, can be extremely effective, but of course it is not the same as lettering. It succeeds by being formal and typographic - a swash italic with some calligraphic alternatives to be used very sparingly. I suspect that it was inspired by Van Krimpen's similar concept Cancelleresca Bastarda, which  I don't think has been digitized.  <BR> <BR>I admit that things you would use Poetica for could always be better done by an excellent calligrapher. However, this is usually not a practical option both because of cost and because the calligrapher would have to be good indeed. The showing at the beginning of this thread has precisely the freedom and variation that you couldn't do in type, as Mark Simonson - who is awesome at this sort of thing - points out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On the one hand, it's certainly true that digital type can't yet come anywhere near the level of calligraphic sophistication shown at the beginning of this thread. <BR> <BR>On the other, it's also the case that given an intelligent font format such as AAT or OpenType, it is possible to do some pretty amazing calligraphic stuff in a (single) font, and have it all work intelligently. Yes, the amount of work is excessive. There are 12 different forms of the lowercase &quot;p&quot; in Caflisch Script Pro, and it doesn't even have extra-swashy variants of that letter. Then there's all the work to set up the contextual behaviors&hellip;. <BR> <BR>Today, we have only two fonts that do this in full, Zapfino and Caflisch Script Pro. There are a couple more that go fairly far down the path: Poetica Std and Bickham Script Std. I believe that such fonts will continue to be few and far between, basically existing only as a showcase for the typographic and design prowess of an individual or a company. <BR> <BR>But then again, it's probably a minority of today's type design that has appropriate recompense, anyway. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>
