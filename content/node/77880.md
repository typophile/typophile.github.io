body: "Hello Typophiles:\r\n\r\nJust wondering if anyone knows the history of any
  proposals that may have been made in the past to systematize a universal \"x-factor\"
  for typefaces that would allow easy calculation of ideal body text sizing? (Searching
  the forums didn't reveal any hits...)\r\n\r\n***************************************\r\nFor
  example:\r\nIf we just hypothetically used Helvetica 55 as the universal standard
  yardstick (since it's so ubiquitous), we could give this font an \"x-factor\" of
  1.000 and then assign an x-factor to all other fonts based on the ratio of their
  x-heights to Helvetica's (using 1000 UPM measurements).\r\n\r\nHelvetica:\r\n714
  (ascend) + 286 (descend) = 1000 UPM\r\n517 = x-height\r\n\r\nTimes New Roman:\r\n717
  (ascend) + 283 (descend) = 1000 UPM\r\n461 = x-height\r\n\r\nSo, the \"x-factor\"
  of Times New Roman compared to Helvetica would be:\r\n517 / 461 = 1.122.\r\n\r\nTherefore,
  if you regularly set Helvetica at 10 points, then you would set Times at 11.25:\r\n10
  * 1.122 = 11.25 (rounded to nearest 1/4 point)\r\n\r\nIf this x-factor number were
  published with fonts, it might make it easier to help non-techie and non-designer
  font users make better sizing choices instead of resorting to naming solutions like
  \"Baskerville 10\" to show intent at 10-point size..."

  body: This would be quite useful. I think CSS has an x-height adjust for adjusting
    font size without adjusting "font-size". Never seen anyone use it.

  body: "Not practical.\r\n\r\nLeading, x-height and copy-fitting are co-dependent.\r\nIf
    you equalize x-height by bumping up the size of the smaller x-heighted face, then
    it will become too tightly leaded (fitting the same amount of copy in the same
    space) or will require more space (with the same proportion of leading). \r\n\r\nTry
    it with Helvetica and Futura."

  body: CSS has an adjustment for between preferred and fall back font that is not
    supported by IEx. Meta data containing x ht and aspect ratio to a standard would
    be nice, but I'd suggest verdana, not helv. as the measuring schtick. There is
    only 1 verdana.

  body: "I agree with Nick -- not practical. Fonts have more dimensions than just
    an x-height.\r\n\r\nNever seen a PDF with Adobe-Sans / Adobe-Serif font substitution?
    It's horrible. I'd rather have the old Courier."

    need to know somehow, what the aspect ratio and relative xht are.. Its just like
    in the olden days, before the pour and print of wysiwyg. '
