body: I am trying to find what font was used for Island and for Fest.  Original graphic
  designer is MIA so I am assuming they are OOB.  I am helping the township put together
  materials for their latest festival and it would be nice to have the option of using
  these fonts in new materials along with the old logo.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IslandFest
