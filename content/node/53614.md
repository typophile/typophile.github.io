  in UAE and Pakistan. Red peaches are covetable and noble there. I think to spend
  modern european language in this logo as honor to middle east. Can it work? What
  do you think?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kahlkopf.com/files/peachred3.gif\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Too much gradient in it, I think. Keep it to the peach only. The type doesn't
    really need it, and is only visible when type is big. But quite alurring to look
    at all together. If only one item of the identity is gradiented, then it will
    also create a bit more contrast and life to the gradiented item. Good Luck.

  body: I agree with illix. I'd think making it work without all the gradients is
    a better start. At least for finalizing the shape. But in general I really like
    the idea of it.

  body: "I think the type works, it it modern. try working in black and white first.\r\nthen,
    if the design works in 100 pixels in height or half an inch high, then proceed
    with color exploration.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n:tony\r\n\r\n"
