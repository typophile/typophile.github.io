		<div class="commentbody">Wait a minute, I'm not so inflamed by this one.

First of all, Chevron's old logo wasn't really that awesome. It is just so iconic, because we've seen it forever.

They've picked this up ad 3D-fied it… it looks a little internet-y, but it could be way worse. At least it doesn't look like a simple photoshop filter, a la UPS.

Plus, that old typeface wasn't really working, and seems dated.

I know, I know. This new treatment looks dated, too. But I doubt it will last for decades. But the time it gets too dated, they'll replace it again. Probably before then even, at the rate things are going…</div>

I'm no great fan of either logo, but the rebrand ticks all the right boxes that oskerlin notes. Despite your dislike of trademark rebrands of today (swooshes, gradients, cuddly aesthetics), it is certainly a contemporary corporate badge. As designers at the point where this bullshit is spun, it is all very transparent to us. No doubt this was consumer-tested to the hilt, and I'm sure regular folk (not us higher people) would have given it their thumbs up. I think it's a clever, but nonetheless frighteningly successful rebrand.</div>

All of this faux-3D rebranding makes me think that maybe it really is all about computers. It's depressing because it means we're that much closer to being replaced by monkies. Monkies who happen to be marginally trained in Photoshop, but monkies nonetheless. Maybe we lost some sort of vote and the computer kids won. So here's my personal rebrand slogan: graphic design = computers.
That type is pretty lame. Not just by itself, but in the context of being on every other street corner in North America. What are they afraid of? Why does it have to be so wimpy and non-descript? I mean, I know why it is (blasted focus groups!), but why does it HAVE to be?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">From what Oskar wrote, (in the post linked in the original post here), I'd say that Chevron went with the simplest, safest design change. They're clearly trying to soften their image and that visual link with ribbons is a single-move way to turn the militaristic echelons into softer friendly forms. They're succumbing to every new trendy logo rework technique, which is a shame, but they're actually sticking very close to their original image, which is rare.

I've seen some other companies ignore their brand's heritage in ways I believe hurt their image. However, in this case, I think Chevron would've benefitted from a BP-style (Oh, I'm sorry. 'bp-style') redesign/rebrand. I think they should break more of the fetters to their old look if their old image is so problematic and static. BP did this very boldly and very successfully. They really do seem much more committed to the shift of 'oil company to energy company' than most (they <em>seem</em> much more committed). Though, I have yet to see Chevron's new campaign, which may help reinforce the message of change.

I don't really like the type Chevron chose, as it's kind of a say-nothing face in today's context, but I have no doubt it's what they wanted. All-in-all I'd say it's a safe and logical move, even if it's not a stellar logo. I don't think the logo is really going to be their biggest issue in trying to alter their image in the minds of their customers, but that's partially their own fault. Again, bp did a great job of designing a flagship logo to spearhead their philosophical image shift.</div>

My source told me that John Downer did the last version the now defunct logo. 

<cite>"My main objective, back in 1991-1992, when I was
working in SF, was to center the v in "Chevron" and
I nearly accomplished it to my own satisfaction. It 
was just a tad off, due to the fact that C has to be
wider than r. In short, the h matches the width of
the n; and the e matches the width of the o. The
balancing act is definitely not a merit of the new 
incarnation. Its symmetry is rather poor, in fact."
</cite>

It is nice to here such effort being put into something. He was their signage consultant for a while as well.

I can see that the new Chevron logo is softer, but if the goal was to move away from military-like ribbons, I think they didn't quite make it. Anyway, it is the type that disturbs me the most I think.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">After seeing this Chevron re-design, I felt compelled to register here and just say: 
This re-design was not only pointless, but horrible.

It looks like a lame stab at trying to spruce up a well established branding. Why not just slap a leaf on it like all the other companies?

The gradients are hurting my eyes, and keep sending my eyeballs off in a different direction.

In fact, at first, I didn't even notice they used some lame stock font and altered it (ever so slightly).

The C and h look ridiculous together and the r and n aren't my favorite either.

I think I'm going to be sick.
