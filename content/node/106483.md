body: "In typeface design the conscious appeal of even color is subtly broken to deliver
  subconscious functionality.\r\n\r\nAt a basic level this breaking is done unwittingly
  via the idiosyncrasies of compositional methods, such as a physical marking tools
  or geometric constructs.\r\n\r\nAt a higher level this breaking is done deliberately
  via a manipulation of the black-and-white bodies, and ideally the system of such.\r\n\r\nAt
  a still higher level this breaking is done via a judicious redesign of the writing
  system itself.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "As usual when you cite the 'subconscious', my response is 'Prove it'. But
    I'll let you off this time, because I think it is more important to cite <a href=\"http://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/pubs/majaj2002channel.pdf\">Pelli
    et al 2002</a> [PDF], which to my mind is the most important study yet done in
    its contribution to our understanding of 'even colour' (I prefer the term even
    texture) and its <em>functional</em> r\xF4le in reading. Critically, the concept
    of spatial frequency channels defines limits within which variations in typographic
    texture may operate <em>without impeding reading by forcing channel retuning.</em>
    This statement from the study's conclusion is worth re-reading several times:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>For
    each alphabet, font, and size, letter identification is mediated by a single one-or-two-octave-wide
    visual channel. Even in the presence of very asymmetric noise distributions, observers
    continue using the same channel to identify and detect letters and gratings. Together,
    these two findings say that the channel is selected bottom-up by the signal, not
    top-down by the observer.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere are some <a href=\"http://www.yorku.ca/eye/spafreq.htm\">simple
    perceptual tests</a> than one can do to confirm that tuning from one spatial frequency
    channel to another takes time. Ergo, if text involves too great a span of spatial
    frequencies, reading will be impeded by the need to re-tune. So, it seems to me
    that even texture in the sense of letters occupying the same spatial frequency
    channel, is functionally beneficial to reading, while your 'breaking of even colour'
    is so far without demonstrated benefit."
