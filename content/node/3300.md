body: I want to remove a corrupt bitmap from a PostScript Type 1 font suitcase in
  OSX.  <BR>Is there any way to &#34;open&#34; a suitcase in OSX just like in OS9
  in order to allow you  <BR>to manage the screen fonts?

  body: I&#39;d like to find out a way to do this as well. Fortunately, I have another
    Mac running OS 9 right next to me, and I just fire suitcases over there. But being
    able to do it under OS X would be darn handy.

  body: Not that I know of. <BR>Grant, your method seems to be the solution &#40;though
    not handy&#41;.

  body: I recently ran into this too. I had to boot into OS9 to move bitmap fonts
    around. I&#39;d like to know if anyone comes up with a solution, if one exists.

    mode if you&#39;re interested...

    pick the bitmap size you wish to keep in the suitcase too.

  body: 'The official reply from Peter Lofting at Apple: <BR> <BR>There are no built-in
    supports in OSX at present, i.e. nothing  <BR>equivalent to the double-click on
    a font suitcase that exists in OS9. <BR> <BR>However most classic font tools will
    run in Classic emulation  <BR>mode. e.g. you can run ResEdit and delete the NFNTs
    with that.'
