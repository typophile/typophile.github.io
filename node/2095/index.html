		<div class="commentbody">Hi Grant, <BR>Thanks for the reply and offer of help but ive since realised the control panel has little to do with this. <BR>Im having huge trouble with my laptop and its quite scary because ive alot of work to do and since ive gotton panther its lost control. <BR>Ill explain it all because im hoping somebody can give some advice that may help fix this. I firstly installed panther, upgrade, then anytime i tryed open an application it said &quot;unexpectedly quit&quot;. I had to erase the disk and make a clean install. I also installed 9.2, for quark. when i tryed organising fonts with fontbook, the machine got alot slower. When I would try open font book the rainbow spiral just kept spinning. iCal was the same and when i tryed to click &quot;accounts&quot; in the preferences window. I went to an apple place they just got me to install panther again, gave me new discs and it all seemed ok again until i tryed sort my fonts and it all happened again.  <BR>Another clean install later. Trying to forget about fontbook, i just put my essential fonts in harddrive/library/fonts then the computer wouldnt start the same spiral on the desktop waiting for the folders to dissapear. Ive since started up on my os 9 cd and removed the fonts from the library and it all works fine.  <BR>Has anyone an idea why? <BR>and is there a problem with putting too many fonts in the library, i put about 50. would it be safer to put the fonts in the application fonts folder. the laptop is an ibook about 1.5 years old. <BR>Thanks for any help, <BR>david.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Regardless of what else is going on, I'll note that ATM Deluxe is officially *not* compatible with OS X.

Of course, it's still a Classic app, so you have to run Classic to run it.

I find that comforting. Any software manufacturer (Apple, Microsoft, whomever&hellip;) that can identify serious issues and patch them within a week of a major release is on the ball in my book. Yes, it would have been better if the issues had been caught prior to the release of Panther, but we're talking about a massive ball consisting of several thousand chunks of code and individual programs which make up an operating system. Given the complexity of the end product, I'm impressed they were able to release 10.3.1 as quickly as they did. You don't often see an Adobe or a Macromedia fixing issues that fast.</div>
