    taking this issue out of context and using it in your argument is a little unfair

    we make as moderators (and Typophile as an organization) that the community as
    a whole is not always made aware of, and it is our right to withhold that information
    because it may concern the privacy of our users. We are trying to be as fair as
    possible to all parties, all members of our community, regardless of what a small
    handful of people with loud voices may be saying about their business practice,
    religious beliefs or favorite cheeses.\r\n\r\nI try not to let my personal opinions
    about these matters interfere with decisions that need to be made on behalf of
    Typophile the community, and Typophile the organization. If we started moderating
    based on our own biases and on how we feel about people in these forums, I'd have
    deleted your account and a few others*, long ago. But that isn't how we do things
