    Before the earth began, I was already there, in the winds and in the waves. When

    I became immediately the most delicate, the lightest and the strongest way of

    I had an influence for their good. <BR>In all the ages I inspired men with hope,

    acts and comforted them in the desperate moments. I played an important part in
    the life drama that has for aim and goal the complete perfection of Man&#39;s
    nature. Through my influence, the human nature has been raised, mitigated and
    sharpened. With men&#39;s help I became an Art. I have a multiplicity of voices

    wet sprocket, g love and special sauce and a few others picked out, but i need

    that you wouldn&#39;t expect to do country. for example, altho &#34;Stickshifts
    and Safetybelts&#34; by Cake isn&#39;t really a country song, it feels like it
    to me. And this isn&#39;t something that Cake really specializes in, so it&#39;s
    almost a kind of anomaly. Stuff in that vein. Oh another project '

    <BR>- Coalchamber covering Peter Gabriel &#40;&#39;Shock The Monkey&#39;&#41;,
    <BR>- Get Up Kids &#40;not my cup of tea, but anyway&#41; covering New Order &#40;&#39;Regret&#39;&#41;
    / The Cure &#40;&#39;Close To Me&#39;&#41;, <BR>- Teenage Fanclub covering Madonna
    &#40;&#39;Like A Virgin&#39;&#41;, <BR>- Lemonheads covering Suzanne Vega &#40;&#39;Luka&#39;&#41;,
    <BR>- Chicks On Speed covering B-52s, <BR>- The Presidents Of USA covering The
    Buggles &#40;&#39;Video Killed The Radio Star&#39;&#41;, <BR>- Crash Test Dummies
    covering XTC &#40;&#39;Ballad Of Peter Pumpkinhead&#39;, originally released in
    &#39;92, but anyway, it&#39;s a good song&#41;, <BR>- Smashing Pumpkins covering
    Alice Cooper &#40;&#39;Clones&#39;&#41;, etc. <BR>'

    Dance with Somebody,&#34; is really good, though it&#39;s only available in a
    bootleg version on the internet. It would be perfect for your project. <BR>- The
    Fugees&#39; version of &#34;Killing Me Softly&#34; <BR> <BR>Faux Country <BR>-
    Camper Van Beethoven&#39;s got to be the motherload. Unfortunately, I bought most
    of their album in the pre-digital era, so I&#39;m not able to look for specifics
    without leaving my desk, going downstairs, dusting off lp&#39;s, etc. &#34;Joe
    Stalin&#39;s Cadillac&#34; comes to mind. &#34;The History of Utah?&#34; <BR>-
    Shudder to Think&#39;s song, &#34;Lonesome Dove,&#34; off of the First Love, Last
    Rites soundtrack would be perfect.
