  I didn't have an answer. Anyone know if it's Adobe vs. MyFonts.com vs. .......?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDylan"

    type in old versions of the CS suite, and if he just wants one license of a bunch
    of Adobe faces, buying a used copy of CS or CS2 can be a big fat bargain."

  body: "Stephen,\r\n\r\nIt's some kind of agreement with the publisher she's working
    for. They said, Buy the Adobe Font Folio or purchase Adobe fonts as needed, so
    she was wondering if there were markups on type depending upon the vendor.\r\n\r\n"

    type beyond Adobe's.

    Resident Guru status around here, any thoughts about the original question...is
    there a consistently cheaper source for Adobe fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDylan\r\n"

    doesn't sell single weights. Their family price is the same as Adobe's: $199.\r\n\r\nThis
    is the case with most fonts of a particular foundry -- the prices really don't
    vary much from shop to shop. Rather than bargain hunting, your friend's best bet
    is to go with the company she feels most confident in. Think about support and
    service after the purchase."
