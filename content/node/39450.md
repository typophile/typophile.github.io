  body: The client said it was but this was created before my time. I do not have
    much more to go on. Unfortunately the file is a vector EPS so it no longer retains
    any font information. But you could be right. It looks like it could have been
    hand drawn under closer examination. Need to break down the vector file more to
    make sure.... :(

  body: "I second Pieter \u2026 look at the two \u2018a\u2019 \u2013\_they differ.
    And all three \u2018s\u2019 are different. If this was such an intelligent font
    with lots of alternates, they designer better would have used a final alternate
    \u2018s\u2019."
