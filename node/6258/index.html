<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello, <br> <br>I was looking on the web to find a version of Univers which I encountered some time ago, called 'Univers BQ'. I think this was a digital version from Berthold (but now it can't be found on their new site). It was a superior digitalisation than the Adobe/Linotype one (See also Detailtypografie by Forssman & de Jong). And it had the original &-sign! <br>I know there is something like the Neue Univers (with the new numbering system) from Linotype, but I don't like it as much as the old one. Could this old 'Univers BQ' version be for sale somewhere? <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/4653.gif alt=univers></div>

<div class=commentbody>Just as uncomfortable as not being able to purchase a license to a decent digital Annonce Gothic Extended, dude! <a href=http://www.csaimages.com/dir_rf_fon.jsp> CSA Images</a>' "Bigford" comes close, though. <br> <br>Not every typeface makes it to the screen, unfortunately. That's the harsh reality. <br> <br>And trust me, Bitstream's version is mighty fine. I've got their full type collection on CD-ROM (that was actually my very first purchase as an independent (typo)graphic designer) and I can assure you their digitizations are top notch. Just compare their Zapf Humanist or Humanist Slabserif 712 to Adobe's version of Optima (not that I would use that face in a million years) or Egyptienne F. Suddenly, you'll realize that a lot of lines were meant to be oh so slightly curved, not straight.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Agree with Peter about quality of outlines but not about "Bitstream rights," hum. <br> <br> <br>Anyway, I'm here because of the Ampersand of Univers. The Second one is the original one made by Frutiger team at the time of Deberny and Peignot, then for US market (perhaps for the Monotype version in early days), they designed an alternative one such &. <br> <br>voil</div>

<div class=commentbody>Isaac, <br> <br>The alternative letters are pretty fun. Since Futura has so many round shapes, you can substitute an alternate <i>a,</i> for instance, in a word like <i>page,</i> where you would otherwise have three circles one-after-another. Having read Hrant's pages, I would now say that this improves the Bouma. The alternative characters can break the pattern, and even substituting a single letter can radically change the look of Futura. <br> <br>There were originally several other characters</div>

<div class=commentbody>I believe the only digital Univers with the Et ampersand are the Linotype Univers and the BQ Univers. I think I agree with Jean-Francois about the Linotype Univers, something not quite right about it. <br> <br>As Jean-Francois also alludes, Bitstream Zurich is obviously an unauthorised clone of the original. <br> <br>If you really want the "proper" ampersand I don't really see any reason not to digitise your own, adding to the original Linotype/Adobe fonts (which are resonably good) - your original licence governs the redistribution. There are plenty of sources around for the artwork, including old Letraset catalogues (only available as rub-down lettering as far as I remember). <br> <br>Tiffany, were you asking whether the Univers grid you referenced was an original? Hard to tell from your image, but there's lots of reprints of it in lots of books - I think even the A4 flyer/samples were reprinted, I've seen them in bookshops for a couple of quid. <br> <br>Hmm, Futura, it's nice to see some of the more experimental, original forms, especially those "g"s.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Neutraface could give Futura a serious run for the money. I think it works amazingly well as both text and headline face, and it has all the trimmings, including small caps and true italics, loads of ligatures, alternate characters, 7 sets of numerals and whatnot. Yummy... Schwarz rules.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks, Stephen. <br> <br>Dear "CB". I don't get what "joke" I could be having at <br>your expense. A quick glance at the 'Neutraface history' <br>link at House Industries tells a little about how C. Schwartz <br>used actual photographs of lettering used by Neutra in <br>his work.

<div class=commentbody>Rodolfo, yes, I think we agree, I just didn't understand your linking Futura to art-deco - I think you're just meaning it's a product of its era, and art-deco and Bauhaus are of course contemporaneus (sp?). <br> <br>With Neutraface, yes, there was no lowercase (AFAIK), so Christian designed his own to fit - I'm not sure on the origins of Neutra's lettering, but certainly it was in use in the 1950s. However, again, I'd say that the influence was Bauhaus/Modernism rather than art-deco. <br> <br>Whichever, they both originate in the 1930s. <br> <br>Stephen, I don't believe I have anything to prove - read Rudolfo's later post. As to names - well I tried my own name, but some villain has apparently pinched it - so it was a pseudonym whatever way I did it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>Futura became such a successful <br>>and influential typeface exactly because <br>>it got rid of the alternative, experimental <br>>characters <br> <br>I think that's probably close to the truth - we can probably consider that the experimental characters were exactly that, rather than something to be eventually used. <br> <br>I actually used one of the "g" variants in a design project, had to cut it out of black paper - no one knew the face it originated from. <br> <br>Also, if you look at some of the much later Futura variant/adaptions, I think it's clear that the experimental forms would not have been possible - even in the bold versions of The Foundry versions they look somewhat ungainly - think about an ultra-black condensed!? <br> <br>I was reminded about something yesterday, about the Univers ampersand. I mailed Adobe about this a little while ago - you know of course that now the Adobe Univers is available as OpenType? Anyway, I remarked to them that a new digital Univers, without the "proper" ampersand, seemed like a missed opportunity to me - they could have had it as an alternate form. <br> <br>I don't believe it's been changed.</div>
