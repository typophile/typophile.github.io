  Sample"> <BR> <BR>Hi there, <BR> <BR>I found this font some months ago and want
  to use in a client job. Unfortunatly I can&#39;t remember where I found it / downloaded
  it from to check licensing restrictions etc. <BR> <BR>I was wondering if it looked
  familiar to anyone or if you knew where it came from / who made it etc. <BR> <BR>&#40;The
  font file is called &#39; flava &#39;  and the download file was named &#39; Macintosh
  TrueType.sit &#39; if that helps at all!?&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help! <BR>Cheers,

  body: I am not too sure about the name, but the font itself is from Utopia Fonts,
    if I remember correctly &#40; The creators of world famous &#39;Loki Cola&#39;
    &#41;.. <BR> <BR><i>&#40; Sad, but true, the &#39;Utopia&#39; site seems to have
    disappeared from the web, in the recent past.. &#41;</i>
