  <em>boxy</em> feel to it. Right now I am using FF Din, I just wish it was available
  in small caps. Can anybody think of a better font?\r\n\r\nIt should be simple, pure,
  minimalist, geometric, highly visible at small sizes, and it should be a good fit
  for the logo.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Another variation of the logo can be seen on my [[http://www.designbits.de|website]].
    The font is FF Tisa and it's not boxy at all but rather strikes a balance between
    the logo and the font itself.

  body: "Ibis is nice. But why would you go for a serif font here, Frank?\r\n\r\nPanoptica
    is nice too. But it has sooo much character. And it doesn't feel <em>techy</em>
    enough to me in this particular context. I'm a little afraid it will drive attention
    away from my logo to the font also. Wouldn't a simpler font, such as FF Din, be
    a better option...?"

    and I responded. DIN sits quite nicely with your mark, but the whole thing might
    be a little bland \u2026 It is certainly not bad though."

    more or less the same angles.

    not that difficult really, you can use the original typeface for reference.\r\n\r\nAnd
    it's way more satisfying. :)\r\n\r\nYou do have to be a bit comfortable working
    with illustrator."

  body: "I'm usually late to the party, and wearing shorts while the rest are in suits.
    However, my curiosity overpowered my antisocial tendencies. I currently have only
    one commercially available font, that just happens to be a boxy sans. I threw
    it together with your mark just to see if it would stick to the wall.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_38_Variations_3654.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
    inclined to repeat timaarts' comment about making the mark and the type play off
    each other. That makes for a much more cohesive logo and less likely to get ripped
    off, by the design trolls. \r\n\r\nIn which case, my offering wouldn't work at
    all in your current mark iteration. But, there it is."

  body: "Hi Jeff,\r\n\r\nThanks for joining this \"party\". I'm afraid this time it's
    me who is a little late.\r\n\r\nIt's weird but of those four logos you suggested
    I like the first one best. Is it the one I created or is it a pure coincidence
    that you used FF Din as well?\r\n\r\nI'm a bit confused because I can't see what
    logos were posted in this thread before. I suppose that Typophil automatically
    deletes images after a certain amount of time has passed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I would
    be curious to know how to plot the shape of the \"d\" in FF Din onto my logo mark
    in order to make the two look more coherent. Can anybody suggest a good tutorial
    on this?"

  body: "Tintin,\r\n\r\nThat first one is yours. I guess I should have labeled them.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as getting the mark and the type to play off each other, I don't know of any
    sources that offer tutorials. I think it's one of those things you have to observe
    in other well crafted logos and try and incorporate in your own designs. I think
    you've got a start by using similar colors and not using a serif font. And copying
    the \"D\" mark into the type wouldn't work.\r\n\r\nPerhaps find logo books at
    the library or book store. I find hand drawing really good logos gives me a feel
    for how they were crafted and hopefully sticks a little in my brain."
