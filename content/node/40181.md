  I don't like the swashy italics or Q. I'm looking for something that has Plantin-esque
  neutrality/solidity and ideally a reasonably dark colour on the page, but still
  some slight idiosyncrasies (I love Fell's numerals). Any suggestions would be much
  appreciated.\r\n\r\n\u2014P."

  body: "Thanks for your suggestions. Poynter Old Style is good but a bit too light.
    And I really like Van De Keere but it is probably too expensive for me right now
    (this is a self-initiated project). Out of interest, does anybody know if DTL
    Fell is available for purchase\u2014it doesn't seem to be for sale on the DTL
    website?\r\n\r\nTo summarise what I am looking for; something with a fairly dark,
    Plantin-esque colour, solid forms (definately shouldn't have sharp serifs), not
    too much contrast, unpretentious feeling but with some idiosyncrasies. I am sure
    something like this must exist out of the thousands of typefaces out there!\r\n\r\nAny
    ideas are much appreciated\r\n\r\n\u2014Phil."

  body: "Thanks a lot for more suggestions\u2014Musee looks close, in fact I really
    like it. To help clarify a bit further; Indigo is too 'sharp' (the angled cuts
    on the a,d etc.) \r\n\r\nStephen\u2014I really like Clifford in its own right
    and looking at it again it is similar to what I'm looking for. But, and I don't
    know this is a good explanation, I feel like it has too much 'sparkle'\u2014perhaps
    because of the tapered vertical strokes? I'm comparing this to Musee or Plantin
    which look more solid and abrupt. Other thoughts/comments appreciated,\r\n\r\n\u2014Phil"

    \r\n\r\nYes, you really do need to print text fonts to properly test. <a href=\"http://www.stewf.com/work/fontshop/ff-clifford-sample.pdf\">Here's
