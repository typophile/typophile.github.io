  body: "A nice analog way to get a graphical display of ink use.\r\n\r\nIf I <em>had</em>
    to know I would have rendered the \"Sample\" text at a large size into a bitmap
    using Freetype and count the ratio of black against white pixels."

  body: "I did some tests about ink coverage when defining the look of the font I'm
    developing. My method is much less interesting than this demonstrated by Matthew
    Robinson \u2013but save some pens and walls:\r\n\r\n<strong>1</strong>. I selected
    a typical book page set in my font in InDesign.\r\n<strong>2</strong>. Exported
    the page to a high resolution, 1200dpi JPG image.\r\n<strong>3</strong>. In Photoshop,
    I did crop the margins and desatureted the image.\r\n<strong>4</strong>. Using
    histogram, I selected the first 128 levels and take note of the resulting percentil.\r\n\r\nNote
    that ID exports to a RGB JPG. I preferred not to change it to CMYK in Photoshop
    to avoid many changes in the image. The histogram selection was taken the first
    128 levels to contain the range between absolute black and the mid-gray dots.\r\n\r\nIn
    order to get a more consistent result, I repeated this with other two random pages
    from the middle of the document.\r\n\r\nTo compare with other text serif fonts,
    I changed the type size in order to have exactly the same amount of text in the
    sample pages. And repeated the operation.\r\n\r\nThe results were:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Footprint_4742.PNG]\r\n"
