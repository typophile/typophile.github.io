body: "Well, I thought this would be easy to find, but it's proven difficult.  It's
  not your standard Pro Block or Varsity.. more like a hybrid semi-serif.  It's close
  to Varsity, but small differences (long middle and exaggerated serifs on E, lowered
  R centerline, right-angle serifs on S characters) make me think it's either custom,
  or another lesser-known font.  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nSorry for the small sample, but
  these five letters are all I've got!\r\n\r\n(note: This is not the same font used
  on their vintage jerseys, <strong>[[http://www.fansedge.com/Images/Product/51-29/51-29902-F.jpg|shown
  here]]</strong>.  It's a new style for this year, a modernized vintage, if you will.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sixerslou_3566.jpg]"
