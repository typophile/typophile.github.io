    does not refer to a single kind of practitioner, e.g.\r\n\r\n<cite>Typography
    is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors,
    and clerical workers. Until the Digital Age, typography was a specialized occupation.
    Digitization opened up typography to new generations of visual designers and lay
    users.</cite>\r\n\r\nHave fun!"
