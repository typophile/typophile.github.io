  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey There! I&rsquo;m looking for some possibly life changing advice, so I&rsquo;d greatly appreciate it if you could read my post and offer whatever thoughts you may have. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Let me give you a quick run down on my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m 20. After high-school I went to university for graphic design, but hating it, I dropped out after only the first year. For the next two years [to present], I&rsquo;ve worked as a freelance web-designer. Now I&rsquo;m thinking about the future. Freelance is unstable. I&rsquo;d like to find work with a studio, but I have no idea how, where to begin, or whether I am qualified or skilled enough.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll link you to my portfolio so you can keep it in mind as you read the rest.
<a href="http://www.skywide.net">www.skywide.net</a></p>
<p>My question to you is: How does one go about finding their first full-time graphic design job?</p>
<p>I have no full-time working experience. My resume consists of a scattering of freelance positions with a variety of individuals, organizations, and a few running overflow agreements with some local studios. I do have a few strong references.</p>
<p>Is it generally accepted that studios/organizations only hire people who&rsquo;ve completed university or college programs?</p>
<p>Perhaps I need to do some sort of internship?</p>
<p>Please take a look at my website and offer honest feedback. Do I even stand a chance? Is my portfolio varied enough? Is it what employers are looking for?</p>
<p>Really, whatever advice you have to give would probably be helpful.</p>
<p>I have little interest in going back to university to complete my design degree [citing reasons such as insane tuition costs, lack of actual learning.], but it is an option&hellip;</p>
<p>Thanks,
Blake</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Okay, I&rsquo;m only two years out of school, so take my advice with a grain of salt:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say you have a good start, especially considering you have almost no formal training. The majority of your work looks pretty &ldquo;safe,&rdquo; and seems to be very ad-company-ish, but there is obviously a lot of thought going into them. I would be curious to know in what capacity and how much of these websites are yours, and how much other team members contributed. I particularly like the design on &ldquo;warfare grounds&rdquo; and theillest.com, as they seem to have a little more personality.</p>
<p>I have a hard time saying don&rsquo;t go to school, but you may be okay. I&rsquo;m not nearly in a position to tell you what employers are looking for, but I would have to say most creative firms have a &ldquo;proof is in the pudding&rdquo; philosophy. A BFA from RISD would certainly help your resumé, but I think what matters most is your portfolio. Depending on what languages of code you know, that will help bolster you as well. Java and Flash Actionscripting are a huge plus, but maybe you should here from someone who isn&rsquo;t a print designer&hellip;</p>
<p>If you are an AIGA member, they have excellent networking events. Creative hotlist and coroflot.com may be good places to start looking for jobs as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked as the sole designer on all these projects, and take full credit for everything you see on my website.</p>
<p>The problem I&rsquo;ve found with freelancing is that the people who are willing to pay well, aren&rsquo;t interested in taking risks. That&rsquo;s why a lot of my more recent projects have been pretty simple and safe, unlike some of my older more fun designs.</p>
<p>What is AIGA all about?</p>
<p>Thanks for the helpful comment, very much appreciated.</p>
<p>James Puckett,</p>
<p>I write php, xhtml, css, javascript, actionscript, all relatively well.</p>

They have annual dues of about $310, which may be a little steep on a tight budget, but like I said, they have great networking events, discounts on admission to some galleries/museums, great lectures as well as some exclusive job listings (aiga.org).</p>
<p>James is right, if you have all that coding skill, you should find a job relatively easily, at least compared to a print designer.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably a bit regional, but, as you&rsquo;re still young with little work experience, yea, I think most graphic design firms are going to lean towards folks with full art and design degrees.</p>
<p>Web design is a bit different. They&rsquo;re not quite as picky as to specific degrees, as it&rsquo;s such a varied field.</p>

The Don is right: If it&rsquo;s about money, this is the wrong profession.
The idea of working for an agency was hell to me, so I started doing my own thing (which is not for everyone, and the risk is high, but it works for me and I&rsquo;m glad i took the gamble)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Blake, you&rsquo;ve worked with clients (which is a good thing to have under your belt) but have no formal training (no degree makes it harder). If you want to work for an agency/ firm, I think you&rsquo;re on the mark when you suggested an internship or a junior position. Unless you are a design prodigy, you&rsquo;ll have to prove yourself and build your resume for larger, more stable stuff. With web design, I gather it&rsquo;s all about technical skills when you&rsquo;re starting out.</p>
<p>Your work has solidity and variety, but lacks a certain spark and depth which usually comes from experience and collaboration with a team. My advice is to hit AIGA&rsquo;s site, craigslist, Coroflot, and anywhere else you can find to seek out openings.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi I always find it amazing people trying to find a quick fix or a short-cut. Nothing really comes for free and the only way to get there is by doing it&hellip; don&rsquo;t wait for hand outs. Hard work or putting yourself on the line, by just doing it&hellip;</p>
<p>You are only 20!!!&hellip;  if you think you need more design discipline or skills go back to design school NOW&hellip; take from it what you want, be motivated and inspired by others as they too may be inspired by you. 4-5 years now to get that dream job (maybe) is worth it&hellip; unless you are so talented that an agency will head hunt you and put you in a great role of creative&hellip; &hellip; it&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>Hard work, put yourself out there&hellip; get noticed&hellip; go back to school or get a job as a junior or a mac op&hellip;. because once you are in an agency, the foot is already well in the door.</p>
<p>Freelance as a mac op via design recruitment/HR/freelance company, though they will want to know history and will test you on your skills, once in they can get you temporary positions freelancing at small to large agencies.</p>
<p>A problem for graduates is that no-one wants a graduate without real agency experience, how is a graduate supposed to get real experience if no-one is willing to take them on?&hellip; thats where the internships help out I guess.</p>
<p>in your case you have had real experience in web, so I would be using that, it is your &lsquo;in&rsquo; your foot in the door.. or go to a company like Aquent (example only)&hellip; or bang on every door.</p>
<p>Go back to design school and do an internship at the same time&hellip; maybe pick another school&hellip; remembering you quit design school, so an employer may think &ldquo;this person may quit us?&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>The future is yours&hellip; play hard and have fun</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Blake,
My most important advice to you: Make sure it&rsquo;s you who determines what direction you&rsquo;d like to take in your career. Talking with others may help; but ultimately the desire must be discovered inside you.
I studied computer science for three years in college before finally coming to grips with the idea that—while I liked it, and was good at it—I didn&rsquo;t love it. It would have been a safe career path for me, and I could have done what I really loved on the side; but I decided to change direction so I could work at what I love full-time.
Maybe you&rsquo;re sticking with web design because you feel like it&rsquo;s a safe path; but I assume that you&rsquo;re wondering what&rsquo;s next—meaning you&rsquo;re not truly fulfilled with where you&rsquo;re at presently. Find within yourself what kind of work you would eventually love to do everyday. For me it&rsquo;s type design and print design. I&rsquo;ve still got a way to go before type design can be the primary focus of my professional life every single day, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working toward.
You&rsquo;re good enough to get contracts working in web design, but you might love working with animals or making music or teaching history for all we know.
So try a lot of things; meet a lot of different kinds of people. But make sure it&rsquo;s you who decides where you want to end up. Then follow your passion for it and you&rsquo;ll get there.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am terrified to see people saying you should continue to be a dropout. No matter what happens, it&rsquo;s hard to see a downside to having finished your degree 5 to 10 years from now, and easy to imagine upsides: scenarios in which you&rsquo;ll be very, very grateful you did. I agree with an earlier poster: switch schools. Do what it takes&ndash;and do internships along the way&ndash;but get yourself fully and conventionally credentialed. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be naked out there in the future. Not to mention the global depression now starting to stir! Please, please don&rsquo;t play around with your future. It doesn&rsquo;t seem very substantial yet at 20, but that is a flagrant, completely predictable error of perspective and nothing more.</div>
