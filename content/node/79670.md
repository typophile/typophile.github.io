  published in Dutch in 1985, this small volume by [[Gerrit Noordzij]] expounds an
  entirely new theory of the design of writing. At its core are three concepts:\r\n\r\n<ul>The
  [[Heartline]]</ul>\r\n<ul>The [[Counterpoint]]</ul>\r\n<ul>A function [[\u03B1]],
  which describes the transition from one counterpoint to the next</ul>\r\n<!--break-->\r\nThe
  heartline is the skeleton of a stroke. It is a zero-width description of the path
  of a pen. The counterpoint is the width and angle of the writing instrument, which
  can change independently from the direction of the stroke. Between any two counterpoints
  is a transition, gradual or abrupt, which describes the taper of the line (or lack
  thereof).\r\n\r\nUsing these concepts together, Noordzij posits two primary types
  of [[contrast]]: [[Translation]] and [[Expansion]]:\r\n\r\nTranslation is contrast
  that arises due to the changing angle of the heartline relative to the counterpoint.
  Contrast in [[calligraphy]] is one example: the stroke is thickest when the angle
  of the pen is perpendicular to the motion of the stroke, and thinnest when the angle
  of the pen matches stroke direction.\r\n\r\nExpansion is contrast that arises due
  to a change in the width of the counterpoint. Contrast in brush painting is one
  example: the stroke is thickest when pressure is applied to the brush and the brush
  expands.\r\n\r\nTranslation can be combined with expansion, as when pressure is
  applied to the stroke of a broad-nib pen, or by using an angled brush.\r\n\r\nNoordzij
  applies these concepts to [[typography]], which he refers to as \"dehydraded writing\".
  He suggests that although typographical strokes are drawn rather than written, their
  [[modulation]] can be described using these terms."
