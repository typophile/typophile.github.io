    par with something like Gotham Thin. But it only went up to 36 pt. How big a display
    face are you thinking?\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I came across something from a Montreal foundry in the mid 19th century,
    where gigantic monoline letters could be assembled from parts (quadrants), so
    that an entire ad may be set inside the letter \"G\" for instance. I wish I had
    made a note of the specimen book, or scanned it.\r\n It's in the McGill library."
