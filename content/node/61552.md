  effect the word \"hound\" appears like a hound?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fox_4860.jpg]\r\n\r\n<cite><strong>Hint:</strong>
  The bottom of the stem of the \"F\" looks like the nose and the swoosh of the \"x\"
  looks like a tail. To me it seems like the fox is looking at me.</cite>"

    I know it's not really a fox. I mean the tail more looks like the one of a cat
    but do you think that the font-selection was just a coincidence? I'm curious about
    your opinions."

  body: "I found something quite interesting on wikipedia. It's about the pangram
    \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\":\r\n\r\n<cite>\"In the Disney
    movie The Fox and the Hound, there is a scene near the end where the fox is running
    fast and jumps over the lying-down hound, creating an in-context, non-contrived
    instance of the phrase.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nThis tells me that typography was very
    important for the designers. And if you take a closer look at the title screen
    again there occurs one question: Isn't the quick brown fox jumping over the lazy
    dog in this scene?\r\n<em></em>\r\n\r\nHere is the link to the wikipedia-article:

  body: I don't know if it was intentional or not, (though I definitely get a perky-fox,
    droopy hound vibe) I think it's adorable that you see one. Like one of my friends
    says, art belongs to the viewer.

    about this, perhaps?"

  body: "I'm convinced the spryness of the x and droopiness of the H and d are intentional,
    but as for the words proportions to each other, it seem much more attributed to
    the natural length of the words. So maybe it was intentional, in that the designer
    didn't fudge with the words too much\u2014 because restraint best illustrated
    the concept. "
