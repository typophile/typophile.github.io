  body: "I agree about most of what riccard0 said. I don't see any problem with the
    'g's though, and the slope of the 't' appears to be referencing the wedge shape
    of Garamond and Caslon's 't's, while not actually going through with it, which
    seems to fit with the font.  (Of course, you could bring the height down while
    still pointing the slope at the tip of the crossbar, but then it wouldn't align
    with the dot of the 'i.')\r\n\r\nThe width of the n, h, and u do seem a bit narrow
    compared to the geometrically round characters, but on the other hand, they do
    fit with the 's.' I would try to bring the width of the round characters in a
    bit (including the beak on that 'e') as you nudge the n, h, and u out very slightly.
    The 'a' especially, does not need that serif adding any extra width; try making
    it into just a nub and see how little you can get away with. Along those same
    lines, you can probably bump that stem to the left a hair (this goes for the g,
    b, d, p, and q too) so that the counter cuts into it just slightly. That will
    not only cut its width down, but will make the line width look more even.\r\n\r\nDoing
    what I just described may preclude the need for this, but one other thing that
    bothered me about the a was the straightness of it's stem at the bottom. It looks
    like it should be sloped on the inside edge to fit with the serifs.\r\n\r\nAnother
    issue is the descender length. The p seems cut off compared to the y, but it does
    look good with the serif on. Maybe you could bend that y's tail a bit, to bring
    it closer to the p. You should also indent the side of the y just a hair. If you
    look at professional fonts, many of the 'y's do not have perfectly straight sides,
    even though they look that way at a glance. If you take the anchor point at the
    bottom of the valley and move it down slightly, that's another form of optical
    compensation commonly used on 'y's.\r\n\r\nLooking more closely at some of the
    letterforms, I can see some subtle issues that could be tweeked. The serifs on
    the bottom of an r are generally weighted so that the serif under the overhanging
    stroke is a bit longer, but yours seems to have reversed that principle. Presumably
    you took that section from the n or h, where it makes sense to be shorter. Because
    the vertical serif on the end of the r hangs down so close, you might not net
    to extend it beyond the length that it is on the left side, but it shouldn't be
    shorter.\r\n\r\nLastly, I like the terminal on the narrower version of the t,
    but I think it would be improved by making it align with the tangent of the round
    characters at approximately the point it aligns to them. In other words, if you
    look at the relationship of the t and the e in \"alternates,\" I'm suggesting
    you tweek the angle of the terminal counterclockwise so that it \"cups\" that
    curve perfectly.\r\n\r\nAs for the font overall, I think it is very fun, but sharp.
    That 'r' should be a defining character of the face. In fact, I would encourage
    you to change the name to something with an r in it. I mean, lets be honest, \"Heathen\"
    the weakest word in your example as far as exemplifying the face. \"Solution\"
    and \"alternates\" are much stronger. Then again, the e and a are both problem
    characters so maybe it will look better once you solve those issues.\r\n\r\nI
    like all of the alternates and varying strictness of serifs, though I'd like to
    see two separate examples that strictly use one set or the other. I love the numerals.
    I want to see the full set.\r\n\r\nGreat job. Once you finish fine-tuning, this
    would be a font I would use.\r\n\r\n(Wow. My first post was a long one!)"

    on the outside of the serifs. I think it's a good link to the rest of the face
    (on a character that's generally hard to make unique in slab-serif fonts), but
    I think you should emphasize it a bit more."
