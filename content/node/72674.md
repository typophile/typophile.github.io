    or Futura Black (http://new.myfonts.com/search/futura+black/).\r\n\r\nThe other
    one seems a super-thin version of Futura."

  body: "I've investigated this one along with a few other Doors sleuths over the
    years. I think it's most likely that the logo was designed for a poster and then
    later used on the album cover. If anyone knows better, please let me know. I think
    it was drawn with rules/compass and not from an actual typeface with obvious influence
    from Braggadocio/Futura Black. I extrapolated the logo into a font called <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/densmore/\">Densmore</a>.\r\n\r\n"
