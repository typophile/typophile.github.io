body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI've been working off and on for months on a new identity
  for my company. I'm a web designer/developer, and I also do branding and usability
  work. Not much print work. Maybe 10% of my clients request logo work.\r\n\r\nThe
  work below was inspired a bit by some logos from the fashion industry. I want something
  more 'iconic'--that's based on my name--that isn't just a standard font treatment.
  \r\n\r\nI want to up the sophistication level of my image and not go the standard
  \"web 2.0 route\" that seems so popular these days amongst my web design colleagues.
  In other words, I want a long lasting mark that can carry over to other companies
  I might start that also will have my name on them.\r\n\r\nI took the font named
  Dinamo Regular and used it to create the icon you see below.  I've also included
  what the standard letters from Dinamo look like that I used. It's However, my sense
  is that my finesse and execution is off. I'm unsure at this point as to how to make
  it better. Here's what I'm looking for help with:\r\n\r\n1. insight or opinions
  on how I might make the icon itself better\r\n2. Thoughts about using Granby Light
  (the display font you see) along with it.\r\n3. Thoughts about the layout of the
  logo OVER the company name, as opposed to another position, etc. \r\n\r\nI greatly
  appreciate any help in advance. I'm definitely more big picture designer than I
  am strong in typography and icons, but I'm trying to improve.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dbr-logo-1_5543.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dbr-component-1_3735.gif]"

    to me. Have you tried just connecting the letters?

  body: "Thank you both for your replies and thoughts!\r\n\r\nPatty -- I tried that
    a bit, specifically the second E into the s, and the s into the third e. the transition
    between the two es, as well as between the r and the e, seemed awkward...though
    maybe there's a graceful way to accomplish it that I missed. \r\n\r\nChuck--I
    like where you're going w/ the straightforward approach. I suppose I worry about
    that being a little less memorable. What are the pros that you see in using that
    kind of approach? That lowercase r does make for a nice mark :)"

    about the first few logos that come to mind. they are the most immediately memorable
    to you.\r\n\r\ni'll bet they were very simple marks. the nike swoosh. the macintosh
    apple. ibm. 3m...\r\nit's my opinion that the most memorable marks are the most
    succinct marks. not to say simple, but succinct -- saying what they need to directly,
    cleanly and clearly. like the gettysburg address. 286 words. wow."

  body: "LOL. Thanks, Chuck. I particularly liked the last one ;) \r\n\r\nThank you
    also for your idea--you make a strong point about memorable marks being quite
    succinct. I always found the Nike swoosh story endearing. And I need to remember
    that the logo is not the be all and end all. Nike's brand is strong today not
    because of the swoosh, but because of everything else. The swoosh is just an immediate
    way to identify it.\r\n\r\nThank you again. Most appreciated."

  body: "oh my, can i tell you something COOL? I don't know why this didn't occur
    to me.\r\n\r\nMy husband is my business partner. His name is Jason. Check out
    that r. Flip it, and you've got a j. I've tried, for a LONG time, to find a mark
    that could somehow represent us both. He disliked what I would do, and I dislike
    the ones he created.\r\n\r\nYet..now we have a J and and R. I could keep it just
    that simple r, or I could try to play around to represent the J, too...though
    really it accomplishes both. Astute clients may realize this, but it doesn't require
    them to realize it to be a strong mark. \r\n\r\nI got that font for its \"s\",
    actually. But now...the r may very well have saved me. Thank you again. truly."

  body: "Here's what I worked on briefly. Needs a bit of help with spacing, etc. I
    think the 3rd and 4th ones down are the strongest in terms of balance, proportions,
    etc. I think the \"dot\" on the bottom of the r complicates things and may subconsciously
    trigger thoughts of a question mark, but I'd welcome any thoughts on that.Thank
    you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dbr-logo-revised_6695.gif]"

  body: "Hello,\r\nI am impressed with your willingness to embrace suggestions made
    by other readers so I hope I'm not out of line offering my thoughts on your latest
    logotype ideas.\r\n\r\nI think the dot under the r/j makes it look like an up-turned
    j, it no longer reads as an r.\r\n\r\nThe third idea works best for me because
    the lowercase thing seems a bit played out; I like the shapes of the lowercase
    letters but there is a risk of it looking too Web 2.0 (something you're trying
    to avoid). \r\n\r\nThe combination of the lowercase, the rounded type, the rounded
    corner (the 'r'), and the colours are all Web 2.0 staples, so it might be worth
    dropping <em>one</em> of those elements if you want to keep away from that style.\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/the-logos-of-web-20/\">A list
    of Web 2.0 logos</a>\r\n\r\nAre there small caps in the font you're using? this
    might make nicer shapes and a more classic, timeless logotype (just an idea).\r\n\r\nThe
    simple r shape would be very flexible across a range of media and would work without
    any accompanying text.\r\n\r\nGood luck\r\n\r\n"

    case r shape used in the later samples immediately triggered thoughts of the wilting
    impotent cigarette used in the quit smoking campaigns. Maybe those ads are in
    Canada only? But perhaps you would want to change the angle on it some just to
    make it less similar.... :(\r\n\r\nK."

    I didn't see/know about, but there's no need to apologize. The majority of my
    target market is going to be American...but I'm going to look into the campaign
    you reference as well as run this by a few Canadian friends of mine to see if
    they have similar reactions.\r\n\r\n\"An accident.\" Really good points about
    the web 2.0 aspect. Last night, I tried one out with the font \"Priori (San)\"
    (LOVE that one) for the title part. I've included it below in a couple of variations,
    as well as two versions with \"Mrs. Eaves.\" I think I like the 4th one down best,
    because the lowercase \"d\" in it has some similarities to how the \"r\" is handled.
    Priori or Mrs. Eaves might help give it a bit more of a classical feel versus
    all bubbly/high techy. \r\n\r\nAlthough I like the centering of the bottom one,
    centering like that can be tough to work with at times.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your
    insights. I've gotten to the point where I don't take criticism personally much--the
    only way my work will improve is if others help me see the weaknesses or potential
    problems in it as well as bring up potential \"associations\" like Kristina did.
    Thank you!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logosset2_5647.gif]"

    green. Maybe with a white \"r\" on a green background...\r\n\r\nI like the r/j
    idea. Why don't you play with both in separate shapes, instead of combining them
    in one symbol? For starters, you can use them to frame something else. Just an
    example, I'm sure you can come up with something better :)"

    thanks. One of the things I've enjoyed about posting this here is the brainstorming
    it's helped me do. I have a hard time with sketching/coming up with concepts.
