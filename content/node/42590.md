  I've been playing with this Ultralight weight in my \"spare\" time. I realize that
  I can't license it or anything, and that it's not as difficult as creating a face
  from scratch, but I wanted to know what the 'philes think....\r\n\r\nCaps only as
  of right now, halfway through digits...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Avenir_Ultralight_6354.jpg]"

  body: Just in case you weren't aware, Frutiger and Kobayashi completed a revision
    of Avenir 4 years ago called [[Avenir Next]]. The expansion of weights includes
    an <a href="http://www.linotype.com/90674/avenirnextultralight-font.html">Ultra
    Light</a>.

  body: No card revocation. Linotype might take away your license, though. ;) (According
    to their EULA, you're not supposed to modify the font data.)

  body: Why are your proportions different? Your B and a few other look a bit long
    compared to the rest.

  body: "To answer Dan...I was at first overlaying letterforms from the Heavy to Light
    weights to see how much the widths of the individual characters decreased. I think
    in a few places I wasn't sure exactly where the characters should begin and end.
    I'm not sure how well I can explain myself.\r\n\r\nTo answer Stephen... Maybe
    I'll should re-title this typeface as \"moot point\" to get away with it. I don't
    think a 26-character face would do too well...\r\n\r\nThanks all!"
