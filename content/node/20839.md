  on the topic of arrows, but I am not finding much material on it.\r\nDoes anyone
  know when the arrow started to be used as a directional sign?\r\nSomeone also told
  me that the Meta font ARROW is interesting.\r\nAny other ideas that I could explore?\r\nThank
  you in advance!"

    You might have better luck researching history of wayfinding and then making the
    connection.

  body: "The graphical use of arrows first appeared in cave paintings and carvings
    - arrows depicted in flight pointed to the intended victim, the destination if
    you will. \r\n\r\nAlso as most bowmen were right handed, drawn in profile they
    would point from left to right - hence the left to right arrangement of characters
    in most western writing systems. "
