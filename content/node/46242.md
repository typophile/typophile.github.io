body: "I've been attempting to design an ambigram tattoo for the past couple of years,
  but I'm never happy with the design. I finally drew this last week based on a typeface
  I saw and would like some feedback.\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be my mother's maiden
  name: \"di Noia.\" I'm afraid that I've gotten to the point where I can read the
  name despite how illegible it may be. \r\n\r\nSorry for the bad sketch and copy
  - I had to scan my sketch on the copy machine in my office. I'm in no way a professional
  designer, so any tips to improve it would be great. I'm trying to go for an old-fashioned/European/traditional
  tatoo/almost pirate-like look, hence the blackletter.\r\n\r\nThis is in NO WAY a
  finished piece, obviously; so please don't comment on tracking and such - that stuff
  will come later! :)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Scott[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tattoo

  body: "I like the symmetry, thought I didn't quite get it at first. Still, asymmetry
    is a powerful design principle. It reads to me as \"dio noia.\"\r\n\r\nI think
    that by taking the O out of \"dio\" and letting there be a space would help quite
    a bit. The open end to the 'o' in noia is a bit confusing. Also, I think it would
    be nice to see the 'i' in Noia right-side-up.\r\n\r\nIt looks good, just tough
    to read. then again, its a tattoo right? Who else needs to read it?\r\n\r\nevan\r\n<a

  body: "Thanks, Evan.\r\n\r\nBecause it's an ambigram, I want it to have perfect
    rotational symmetry. So getting rid of the \"o\" shape after the \"di\" would
    require me to delete the \"o\" in \"Noia.\"\r\n\r\nBut yes, that first \"o\" shape
    is what I really need help with."

  body: "As it stands, the 'N' is not drawn with perfect rotational symmetry.  Since
    it's the centerpiece, that needs to happen if you're insisting on perfect rotational
    symmetry.\r\n\r\nCould experimenting with the flourishes on the the 'N' to look
    like an 'o' provide a promising direction?\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "Thanks, Nick. Yeah, you're right. I did make the \"N\" different on both
    sides on purpose, but maybe I should make them perfectly symmetrical.\r\n\r\nI'll
    play with the flourishes a lot...good idea.\r\n\r\n-S"

  body: "Please excuse this <strong>very</strong> bad sketching and scanning job,
    but getting rid of the first \"o\"-shape made me think. So I started playing with
    the negative space a bit.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about this? I think it loses
    some of its legibility, but I'd like to know if I should continue on this route.\r\n\r\n(Actually,
    now that I see it on the screen, I realize the verticals on the \"N\" need to
    be thicker)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-S\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tt1

  body: "My thought was the same as Nick's: if the \"o\" becomes attached to the N
    (as a swashy flourish) and NOT attached to the \"di\" then it <em>should</em>
    reduce the appearance of an extra unwanted \"o\". The change of style for the
    \"D\" was to avoid the hassles of trying to make the \"a\" not look like a \"p\"!\r\n\r\nKeeping
    an eye on the legibility is key, unless you want to end up with (wait for it,
    neologism on its way...) a \"nequigram\" (design that's not readable in either
    direction): there are enough of those about already.\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "Thanks for the comments.\r\n\r\nDave - that looks just like my original sketchy
    from a few years ago. Actually it looks like you copied it right on (great minds
    think alike)!\r\n\r\nI wanted to do something blackletter because I just like
    the style and the inherent masculine quality of it (I know that's argueable).
    I like the contrast between sharp point and smooth curves, too.\r\n\r\nHmm...looks
    like I still need to play around a bit.\r\n\r\nThanks for the ideas. Please feel
    free to sketchy and play as much as you want (I know that can be taboo here sometimes).\r\n\r\n-S\r\n"
