  body: I think this was made using Blippo Black or Pump. The &#39;h&#39; is made
    from an &#39;l&#39; attached to a reversed &#39;s&#39;. All the connections are
    added on. The tracking is closed so that letters touch.  If you give me a few
    minutes, I can use Pump to show you what I mean.

  body: Here is the original lettering and a simulation done &#40;crudely&#41; using
    Pump Demi. I can see that there are rounded joins in the original. That&#39;s
    probably a bit beyond my skill with Illustrator, but probably not for a more accomplished
    professional. I think this is at least a close approximation. I used short line
    segments for the connections. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49816.gif"
