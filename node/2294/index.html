		<div class="commentbody">Okay, let me phrase it differently, and with a lot more words. &quot;VH1&quot; originally stood for &quot;Video Hits 1,&quot; but nobody remembers that. The old logo emphasized the &quot;1,&quot; which ties into the slogan &quot;Music First&quot; &ndash; probably an attempt to differentiate VH1 from sister station MTV, who were showing fewer videos and more non-music programming. The new logo emphasizes the Vh, with the backwards 1 disappearing into the h. Maybe there's something obvious I'm missing (wouldn't be the first time), but what does this new logo represent?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This topic has come up on other boards. Forgive me if I repeat what I've said elsewhere.) <BR> <BR>Why hang on to the old logo? Sure, nothing was wrong with it, but nothing was great about it either. It was stagnant, symmetrical and vanilla. That's why I appreciate their need to move on. <BR> <BR>I'm not sure what to think of the new logo. The leaf, the hacked h and flipped 1 feel fresh. But overall it seems kind of slapped together. The stroke weights of the V h and 1 don't fit and Helvetica just seems tired here&hellip; <BR> <BR>But the net takeaway is a needed change in that it lets the  VH1 mark grow up. <BR> <BR>The broadcast work is rock solid. The whole play on pop culture is fun and the original scoring is great. Finally, to beat the MTV comparison to death &ndash; you can tell they're not deifying the logo like MTV did. See the VH1 reel at <a href="http://www.weworkforthem.com" target="_blank">WeWorkForThem</a>. <BR> <BR>(WWFT did not design the logo. It was done in-house at VH1 by Nancy Mazzei.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What difference does it make if it's a V folding on itself or a leaf or just an abstract organic shape? Should a logo always be a literal representation? I don't think so. I'm not necessarily going to defend this logo to the death, but I don't think it should be dismissed because we don't immediately get it. <BR> <BR>And Kevin, you don't really think they have MTV envy do you? I can't imagine them sitting in a conference room saying, &quot;what can we do to evoke the MTV logo?&quot; At least I want to give them more credit than that. <BR> <BR>That said, I think the execution is lacking. (As I've said before in this thread.) <BR> <BR>Mike, your original logo may have worked well at the time, just like the second logo worked for them through the last decade. I see this third logo as simply more of the same. Not stylistically the same but it's an adequate logo that will serve them well for a time but need to be replaced or evolved sooner than later. <BR> <BR>Couldn't we argue that identities for these kind of ephemeral brands (fashion, music, extreme sports, etc.) need to change more often to stay relevant or interesting? (Food thought, not necessarily words to design by.) <BR> <BR>I think this is why this particular logo redesign is interesting. Because it's not for an airline or a telecom or something that needs to convey stability, longevity, timelessness, etc. It almost demands to be redone regularly. <BR> <BR>Re: Speak Up <BR>True, Grant. That's where you can see my earlier comments in context. As much as I like some of the dialogue at Speak Up, the acidic tones (attitude) over there are hard to take in large doses.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have no problem with non-representational logos, and perhaps if the VH1 logo were just the type treatment I wou'dve bought that argument. My issue is it looks like it's trying to symbolize something, but is really meaningless. Why a box? Why a leaf? Why is the type crammed onto one side with a big empty panel to the right? The designer's explanation can be summed up as &quot;why not?&quot;  <BR> <BR>Sure, music and pop-culture industry logotypes have to change with the times, but to build something clunky and not worry about it because it's just going to get changed again anyway seems pretty lazy to me, and would tend to reinforce the notion that VH1 stands for nothing and will more than likely change directions when the next trend rolls along.

		<div class="commentbody">The logo is brilliant, especially when one thinks about it's main function (brand identifier/personification) and medium where it will be seen. It's not 1950. It works best with colors (see the WWFT spots) and it's fresh. <BR> <BR>Designers are the worst people for responding to change, but they are supposed to be revolutionary thinkers. Most of you sound like you are 95 years old and haven't been laid in 75 of those 95 years. Not one of you has thought in terms of how this logo will be used or that it's playful nature reflects the VH1 brand direction. Granted, the gray version at the top of this page isn't the best execution, but seeing it in motion is all the payoff you need. <BR> <BR>Nice work (as usual), Nancy. <BR> <BR>p.s. The thing that I hear in these boards is the same kind of misguided hatred for the new (UPS logo, anyone?) that seems so counter to how designers <em>should</em> approach work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Glad to hear it, as I was getting the impression someone expected me to be ashamed of myself. It is in fact possible to give something careful consideration and still come to a negative conclusion. I examined it, looked for possible motives for the choices made, and read the justifications expounding that the design is existentially appropriate to something or other, but what I see is still the picture I would put next to &quot;arbitrary&quot; in a dictionary. Some seem to be arguing that that <b>is</b> the message VH1 should want associated with itself (most notably the assertion that begging to be replaced with another design as soon as possible is one of its inherent strengths), in which case, great job. But I am skeptical.</div>

Why not let them? (And I think Nancy made it pretty clear that that was one goal of adopting this mark.) Not doing it would be a missed opportunity. When everybody else is trying to &quot;own&quot; this shape or that color, why not &quot;own&quot; a different attribute like playfulness or the ability to not take yourself (the organization) so seriously.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry, but I still don't like it. While the old one had a boldness, claiming to be the No. 1 music channel even though it was perceived as MTV's li'l sister, this new logo just isn't memorable, isn't modern, isn't unique and, worse, doesn't tell me anything at all about the channel. The same holds true for the original MTV-logo, sure, but that at least has the power of nostalgia and a certain (s)punky flair that I dig. The redesign for VH1 cold just as well be for some health-care organisation or some wellness product. Frankly, I'd rather have seen VH-1 all done in Helvetica and be done with it :-D.  <BR>Nancy, great to see you defend your work and if it really was picked from 25 designs, all the more power to you and your work. But, alas&hellip; a pitch with TWENTYFIVE new logos, in my opinion, is a grave mistake in itself. I'm completely against pitches these days, and maybe that is the problem with the logo.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This got me wondering how most other well known logos have been chosen. How do they get the nod of approval from the typical target audience of design unsavy higher-ups (usually CEOs, partners and probably their family members)? How did logos like Lucent, NASA (worm), bp, etc. make the committee say &ldquo;aha!&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I think was just circumstance that Nancy was employed at the time that VH1 was taking submissions for a new logo, the same time other firms were submitting. And the comets aligned and that select group of decision makers selected Nancy&rsquo;s because it hit a vein with most of them; not necessarily everyone in the world, but the only decisions that mattered were that of the committees. Which is also the reason why we have logo&rsquo;s like Verizon, UPS, Gateway&hellip; no one knows the reasons except for the people that decided.</p>
<p>Personally I like the logo for reasons only my gut knows. I like it for the abstract symbol that it is, I like the vibrant colors, I like that it doesn&rsquo;t scream out &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a music channel!&rdquo; Overall, I like the new brand of VH1 in general. If I were on that committee, I can imagine the amount generic, corporate, overly-thought out, expertly crafted, letterspaced submissions and seeing Nancy&rsquo;s and feel a bit of freshness because of it&rsquo;s purely &ldquo;I put these elements together because it instinctively felt right&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t go that far, but I think that might be one measure to consider using if you are evealuating the &lsquo;success&rsquo; mark. Being outside a given logo&rsquo;s demographic or target group is a hazard/benefit we all share in. ;-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know I’m not normal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not average - certainly.</p>
<p>I agree that good graphic design often challenges the user/viewer a little, and if it is accepted it is stronger for the encounter and displaces previously accepted culture.</p>
<p>Also - people like a little pain. Coke &amp; Fizzy water hurts the tougue &amp; mouth a little. Hot foods do too. But we like the stimulation. Design need be no different as far as I can see. It&rsquo;s a matter of proportion.</p>

<p>It is clever. &amp; it does suggest fun.</p>
<p>What I like about it is the fact that it&rsquo;s design seems to have incorporate almost to know that it is just one in a succession of logos and unlike the others it is okay with it&rsquo;s temporary status. That comfort with transience seems cool. It&rsquo;s one of the things in aughtie (2000+) design which I found distintctive. VH1 isn&rsquo;t my favorite example but is is probably the most ubiquitous example.</p>
