  an ad for TARGET stores, and I would really appreciate your help in identifying
  the typefaces they use. Does anyone know? THANKS!

    indication, you might want to stock up on your Helvetica supplies.

  body: Franz, you&#39;re absolutely right.  Target is littered with Helvetica, from
    their store logo and print ads to their price tags themselves.

  body: Yeah, well.. To many people, consciously or not, nothing says <i>design</i>
    like a tightly spaced Helvetica. And from what I&#39;ve gathered, the whole &#34;designyness&#34;
    seems to be their main selling point.

  body: <i>How original...</i> <BR> <BR>Actually, Target has been using Helvetica
    as part of their look consistently since the late &#39;60s, back when it was &#34;in&#34;
    the first time around. The very first Target store, built in 1962, is &#40;or,
    more accurately, was&#41; about two miles from where I live. It was demolished
    about a week ago to make way for a bigger Target store. <BR> <BR>There was an
    earlier logo which is very hard to find examples of. It looked something like
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/poster-bodoni/bodoni-poster-italic/testdrive.html?s=target&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">this</a>. It was used in early years when there were only a few
    stores.
