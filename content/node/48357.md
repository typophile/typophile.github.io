  (obviously) variants of the same typeface. The third image is another typeface from
  the same poster. (These are the best scans I could do; the edges are cleaner/sharper
  than this.)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if they're relatively unique to this poster
  (I'm assuming they were hand lettered), or if there are any existing fonts similar
  to them?\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WPA font

    found anything like what you posted, but <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com\" target=\"_blank\">dafont</a>
    has some fonts that might be similar in their \"Retro\" section. Here's an example:

    a cabinet position of 'design archiver' who would take and digitize the wonderful
    WPA era typefaces. \r\n\r\nEven better, propose WPA II. "

    around again?\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions, analisa and haresy, some cool
    stuff.\r\n\r\nStill, if anyone runs across anything like these, please post! Such
    beautiful lettering."
