  I am not gonna pay all that for the few letters i need.\r\nI found a lot, such as
  Sackers Gothic, but most don't have that 3 with that flat head, so to speak.\r\nColin
  Samuels has though: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/samuelstype/colin-samuels/|as
  you can see here]].\r\n\r\nAnd free alternatives are even better! It's just a small
  gig, but i need the Gotham look, not for the trend sake of it, but because it fits\r\nthe
  image of the company (traditional painter's company) so well in this case.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for all your help."

    is about saving you $20, on a commercial job? Sorry, don\u2019t wanna sound rude,
    but I\u2019d say: bite the bullet.\r\nAlternatively, what about just lettering
    the few letters you need?\r\n\r\nF"

    Nova]]. Not free, but not really expensive either.

  body: The upside of Proxima Nova, besides it just be a great geometric sans, is
    that you can license only the weight you need.

  body: Indeed, Tiffany. It's a pity you can't license single weights of Gotham. That
    has prevented me from using it more than once.

  body: You might take that into consideration. How many times have you wanted to
    use it? Then factor in cost of your time. Would've Gotham paid for itself by now?

  body: "Thanks everyone.\r\n\r\nFlorian, I don't understand what you mean. Can I
    buy the letters seperately, you say??\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I really wished you could
    license Gotham per weight. It's a real pity you can't."

  body: "Florian, I think I know what you mean now, but there seems to be a misunderstanding.\r\nI
    don't mean to buy all the weights of that font, just one. I only need bold. So
    that's a big difference in price there.\r\nSure I could charge this client for
    this font, but he doesn't even understand (like most people out there btw) that
    fonts need to be paid for as well. I only need to slightly adjust the logo a bit
    and choose this as the secondary typeface in that logo, next to the main typeface
    from the old one.. and it's only a small paint company."

    on buying one of the Gotham packages someday.\r\nIt would probably have paid for
    itself by now, indeed."
