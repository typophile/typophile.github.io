body: So a few days ago I came down with mono AND strep. Ugh. So this was sort of
  the first constructive thing that i've been able to do besides watching tv and sleeping.
  So I dont really know if it's just something that im enjoying because my head is
  cluttered or if it actually has any charm to it. Feedback would be awesome! thanks.

    to it that's very nice.\r\nYou should never be allowed to sleep or watch TV again

    (other than \"LL\"). Having at least one alternate for each character and a little
    Opentype magic would greatly improve the hand-drawn feel this has.\r\n\r\nAs it
    stands, it's quite nice.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "goran: hahaha\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks guys!\r\n\r\nLex: It does sort of have more
    alternates than LL. Essentially every charecter has an alternate that fits under
    the r or t charecter, just those alternates are pretty much the origional letter
    form shrunk. I do think you're right though that it would bennefit from more.
    Maybe I should change those up."

  body: "how would I use opentype to implement alternates? Like, maybe replacing the
    normal r every other or every third time its used?\r\nwould I use salt? Does anyone
    have an example that I could look at?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
