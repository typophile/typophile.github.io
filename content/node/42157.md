body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI just created this logo for a German language website for search
  engine optimization. Actually, it's more like a tutorial website where people can
  learn how to optimize their websites for search engines. The domain name is a bit
  awkward, but quite memorisable for German speakers: www.tipps-zur-suchmaschinenoptimierung.de
  (English: www.tips-for-searchengineoptimization.de)\r\n\r\nDo you think my first
  logo draft is any good? Please note that it will only used on the actual website,
  on a red background that is. There's no need to use it on any other background.
  Thanks for any feedback.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_mglass_3577.png]"

  body: "I like it. I think it's just about perfect. Bold, attractive, to the point.
    The magnifying glass will be a little more realistic /dramatic /interesting if
    you can get a fisheye thing going in there like this. Excuse my crude art.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/such_5484.jpg]"

  body: "I love it!   The b&w drop shadow & its reverse might be a bit much for me.
    \ Perhaps the white drop-shadow should be semi-transparent?   Or maybe the drop-shadows
    should go away altogether (especially on \"Tipps zur\")?   I agree that a slight
    fish-eye effect might be good.\r\n\r\nI think the text could use some further
    kerning - in \"Optimierung\", the r and u are snug while the u and n seem distant.
    \ In \"maschinen\" the s and c seem a bit loose.\r\n\r\nBut all this is nit-picking
    - it's nice, and refreshingly different from standard Web 2.shootmeintheheadnow
    logos.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "OK, thanks a lot for your recommendations. I did some minor changes, as you
    suggested. I added a subtle fish eye effect on the glass (excellent idea by the
    way, logosam) and also did some minor kerning adjustments. Thanks for helping.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_mglass_6332.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Web

  body: Looks great! However, I think that fish-eye isn't quite working.  I'd like
    to see more distortion on the bottom of "Such" - right now the distortion seems
    inaccurate.  If you have a printer and a magnifying glass, you should give yourself
    material to work from.  :)

  body: "I'm glad you like the result. \r\nYou can get a good start on fisheye effects
    in Adobe Illustrator CS with: Object - envelope distort - make with warp - fisheye.\r\nI
    always start there and then hand tailor where necessary.\r\nGood luck. Glad to
    help"
