  question is this: How come the Germans don't include for example \"\xFC\" in their

    understand why they aren''t included in the alphabet. I''m just wondering why
    some characters that actually do represent spoken sounds don''t make it into the

  body: "Well, it just depends what you call the \"alphabet\". Even when I say, \xE4/\xF6/\xFC/\xDF
    belong to our alphabet, we still usually say the alphabet has 26 letters, so we
    don't count \xE4/\xF6/\xFC/\xDF. In a broader sense the \"alphabet\" are the letters
    that were used for Latin. But all the languages that are based on the Latin alphabet
    needed special characters (diacritical marks) to represent the certain local pronounciations.
    This is true for almost all European languages. A French \xE9 is equally important
    as your \xE5. The reason  why people sometimes don't consider them as part of
    the alphebet is because they are build from other latin characters. But that doesn't
    mean they can be omitted. I cannot use a o instead of \xF8 in your language, can
    I? Same is true for German umlaut or French accents. "

  body: "There is a distinction between digraphs and ligatures however the \"ash\"
    (\xE6) is indeed a ligature. A digraph is a combination of 2 characters representing
    a single sound (like the ph in phonetic) but are not necessarily visually connected
    like the \xE6.\r\n\r\nMy interpretation (without any scholarly backing) is that
    most written languages based on the latin alphabet gave up trying to represent
    every specific sound in their language with a contrived alphabetic symbol and
    just started adding diacritic marks to the latin symbol that seemed closest.\r\n\r\nConsider
    the history of the U, double-U and V. All based on one latin symbol with 3 distinct
    sounds."

  body: "In Spanish, the accents simply mean either A- stress this letter, or B- break
    the diphthong that this letter is in.  There is no unique sound to them other
    than the letter is pronounced slightly louder.  \xD1 is not considered an accented
    letter but a separate letter and represents a separate sound.  Older standards
    (pre 1998) dictated that the sequence \xAB\xE1\xE9\xED\xF3\xF1\xFA\xFC\xBB be
    capitalized thus: \xABAEIO\xD1UU\xBB, although now it's standard to see \xAB\xC1\xC9\xCD\xD3\xD1\xDA\xDC\xBB.
    \ This shows they aren't really needed for understanding the language though they
    certainly help.\r\n\r\nIn German the umlauts developed from the writing traditions
    which had the letter e placed over top of vowels at times.  In old German handwriting,
    the e is composed of two diagonal strokes which later became realized as the umlaut
    we have today, again, German is quite readable without umlauts but it's easier
    and more efficient with them.\r\n\r\nEach language has its reason for writing
    them as they do.  In some cases it means taking one letter and overtime re-realizing
    it as another letter with a mark (z->\xE7), while other times it's quite deliberate
    (Danish aa->\xE5).  Even the same modern diacritic can have two different sources
    and meanings in different languages (Germanic umlaut versus Romance di\xE6resis).\r\n\r\nRalf,
    my understanding was that although discouraged, it's always \"okay\" when umlauts
    aren't available to replace them with ae, oe, and ue respectively.  Has that changed?\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    and I believe further that it is very much a distinction with a difference.\xBB</cite>\r\n\r\nWhen
    typing on a keyboard that does not facilitate inputting \xC6/\xE6 or \u0152/\u0153,
    forcing you to type Ae/ae and Oe/oe, then they are digraphs. In themselves, though,
    \xC6\xE6 and \u0152\u0153 are both alphabetic ligatures, not digraphs: they are
    single letters. Note that alphabetic ligatures are different from typographic
    ligatures in that they are historical contractions of letters (or one letter plus
    a second element) that have become single entities, rather than merely specialised
    versions of one or more letters, designed to be used only in conjunction with
    certain other characters.\r\n\r\nOther examples of alphabetic ligatures are regular
    letters with diacritic marks, especially when they are considered single letters,
    rather than modified letters, and even the letter G.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<cite>\xABDoes
    the \xE6 in Norwegian work the same as it does in Icelandic?\xBB</cite>\r\n\r\nNot
    quite, no. It appears in many (though not all) of the same words, where there
    are cognates, as in Norwegian, but phonetically and grammatically, they behave
    in different ways. In Norwegian, \xE6 can be both long and short and is pronounced
    either [\xE6: / \xE6] or [e: / e] (the former being the \u2018default\u2019 pronunciation,
    the latter only found in a smaller number of words), whereas in Icelandic, it
    is always long and represents the diphthong [ai].\r\n\r\nIn Norwegian, while the
    original grammatical (by which I really mean morpho-phonological) r\xF4le is still
    found in many cases, it is no longer productive. In Icelandic, it is nearly always
    productive, though not always: \xE6 is the regular outcome of an i-umlauted \xE1.
    The concept of i-umlauting has been lost as a productive pattern in all Scandinavian
    languages (including Danish, but excluding Faeroese and Icelandic).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe
    traditional way of representing \xE6, \xF8, and \xE5 in the Scandinavian languages
    when stuck in Cambodian Internet caf\xE9s and other such \xE6\xF8\xE5-derived
    locations, is ae, oe, and aa. However, lately there seems to be a growing trend
    (especially common among Swedes) to simply use a, o, and a. Thus, a Swede would
    now commonly write, <em>\u201CMin vaska holl pa a bli ranat\u201D</em> (\u201CMy
    bag was being stolen\u201D) in a colloquial-style e-mail from said Cambodian Internet
    caf\xE9, whereas his worried mother sitting comfortably in her home in Swedish
    would be likely to reply with a properly diacrined (if I may thus verb a noun),
    though no more grammatically correct, <em>\u201DH\xF6ll din v\xE4ska p\xE5 \xE5
    bli r\xE5nat?\u201D</em>."

    a modification of a letter, and hence of its pronunciation, in another alphabet.
    Hence, the same diacritic letter may function differently in different alphabets.

    as a single phonemic signifier -- e.g. 'ch' in English 'church' --, so the term
    doesn't automatically apply to the \xE6 and \u0153. I would probably call those
    something like 'compound letters', at least as the former is used in Norwegian,
    which is as a distinct letter, sorting separately from a and \xE5. In other languages,
    \xE6 and \u0153 might be encountered as optional variant forms of the digraphs
    ae and oe; this is largely as they occur in modern French. In Latin, these forms
    have gone in and out of fashion, so are probably best considered 'historical ligatures'
    for that language. So whether \xE6 and \u0153 are letters, digraphs or ligatures
    depends on what language you are looking at."
