body: crappy wrong title - and you cant edit it..... <BR> <BR>I am finding myself
  doing a lot of brochure work at the moment and would like some advice. Could you
  suggest some fonts for usage with body text. I have been using info, rotis and helvetica
  and i was just wondering if you knew of any other decent ones.
