<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>So how about it? A subject that I find myself currently debating. That is the fact that I am designing a tattoo (for myself), and trying to decide what face I want to use. So far mantinia is winning. I am having some latin text tattooed across both of my forearms. <br> <br>Anyone have typographic tattoos? or Photos? <br> <br>hildebrant.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I was looking through a book in Foyles earlier this week on Helvetica, and noticed that someone had had the name tattooed along their forearms in the typeface. I remember thinking it looked "ok" but not much better. <br> <br>Problem is that it is fairly unlikely that a tattooist will appreciate some of the subtly in your chosen typeface, and may have difficulty replicating its dimensions and spacing in ink under your skin. <br> <br>Also bear in mind that the skin on your arm moves and distorts quite dramatically. I have a geometric design that runs from shoulder to wrist, and a twist of my wrist distorts the design greatly from wrist to elbow. I knew this would happen and designed it in such a way, with the help of my artist, to make it part OF the design itself. I think that typographic tattoo are inherently going to risk looking <i>wrong</i> due to distortion for large periods of time. That is not even taking into consideration how your body will age with time. Take this into account, and try transferring a design to your arm to see what happens in normal movement. <br> <br>Another thing to take into consideration is trapping. Ink <i>can</i> spread slightly under your skin over time, and different parts of your arm may be liable to spread at different rates (this is especially true if you are going to have a multiple sitting with your artist - their mood and therefore the execution of their craft will vary between sittings). Be careful therefore when choosing serifed typeface with fine detailing, and bear this in mind when deciding how large your tattoo will be overall. <br> <br>Remember to take into account how your tattoo will fade too, especially if you are having shading or colour work. <br> <br>Check out this site - you will find loads of stories and photos, and I believe there galleries have a specific section on typographic tattoos. Those here of a nervous disposition may not want to follow the link, by the way. <br> <br><a href=http://www.bmezine.com/ target=_blank>http://www.bmezine.com/</a> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> trapping <br> <br>That's just too funny. Skin trapping. Sounds like something a cannibal type designer would do. <br> <br>BTW, Tony di Pietro also has a type tatoo he's really proud of. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

David, do you mind posting your Typophile T pic <br>you had on <a href=http://www.typographer.org/ target=_blank> your site</a> a while ago? Your tattoo is truly <br>wikkid.

<div class=commentbody>One of the guys who works at <a href=http://www.caffeartigiano.com/>the best café in Vancouver, possibly the world</a>, had MORRISSEY tatoo'd up his forearm in approx. 140pt Copperplate Gothic. Earlier this year he got bored with the typeface and had the design gone over, and longer wedge serifs and some careful decorative elements added. I was quite impressed by how thoughtfully it was done, even if having the name of a pop singer on your arm is more than a bit stupid. <br> <br>The best tatoo I've ever seen was on a friend's back: German late mediaeval woodcuts of the seven deadly sins.</div>

<div class=commentbody>David, <br>you know that I liked your arm tatoo, but I just wonder, looking again to the image, where this one finish? Just before to appear to the other arm Tshirt, so it was all over your body or what? ;) <br> <br>I will understood if you can't answer! <br> <br>John wrote: <br>"having the name of a pop singer on your arm is more than a bit stupid." <br>My first tatoo is a Vespa with a name of my current scooter club on my right arm done in London, at just 18. So, yes, sometimes, when I think about it, I can feel stupid but, after 20 years to live with it, at 99,9% I think it is part of my body and life, and I can't regret to have done it. The only actual regret I have is the type forms for the tatooed words are not well designed ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Karen, it wasn't one sitting, I'd have passed out! The longest I sat for was 8 hours, but it was done in 3-4 hour segments over a period of a few months. <br> <br>JFP, it is capped at the top of my shoulder so its the entire arm, minus the hand. There is one on my leg too ( <a href=http://www.typographer.com/brighton.jpg target=_blank>http://www.typographer.com/brighton.jpg</a> ) and on my ear but I think perhaps you saw both those last year at St Martins? <br> <br>You mentioned the vespa was your first tattoo... does that mean there are more, JFP?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hmm. Should I or should I not post here. I'll post. <br> <br>Although I will probably never (99.999% sure) I will never get a tattoo. I have to admit that while most are, IMO, ugly, a well designed and specifically typographic tattoo has some kind of appeal. It could be that it just separates the hunters from the gatherers. The tattooes of the maori (I think that is what I'm thinking of) are amazing examples of positive and negative space. And I've found myself watching a lot of those motorcycle shows on the Learning Channel, those guys have some cool tattooes as well.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I was looking through a book in Foyles earlier this week on Helvetica, and noticed that someone had had the name tattooed along their forearms in the typeface. I remember thinking it looked "ok" but not much better.
Problem is that it is fairly unlikely that a tattooist will appreciate some of the subtly in your chosen typeface, and may have difficulty replicating its dimensions and spacing in ink under your skin.
Also bear in mind that the skin on your arm moves and distorts quite dramatically. I have a geometric design that runs from shoulder to wrist, and a twist of my wrist distorts the design greatly from wrist to elbow. I knew this would happen and designed it in such a way, with the help of my artist, to make it part OF the design itself. I think that typographic tattoo are inherently going to risk looking wrong due to distortion for large periods of time. That is not even taking into consideration how your body will age with time. Take this into account, and try transferring a design to your arm to see what happens in normal movement.
Another thing to take into consideration is trapping. Ink can spread slightly under your skin over time, and different parts of your arm may be liable to spread at different rates (this is especially true if you are going to have a multiple sitting with your artist - their mood and therefore the execution of their craft will vary between sittings). Be careful therefore when choosing serifed typeface with fine detailing, and bear this in mind when deciding how large your tattoo will be overall.
Remember to take into account how your tattoo will fade too, especially if you are having shading or colour work.
Check out this site - you will find loads of stories and photos, and I believe there galleries have a specific section on typographic tattoos. Those here of a nervous disposition may not want to follow the link, by the way.

<div class=commentbody>I know a lot of people that went to my college who had type tattoos, and they are collectively the reason I doubt I'd ever consider getting one.
Can anybody guess what typeface this one's in?
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n502517205_4906_9150_3494.jpg]
The answer is: it was originally Garamond, but it sure isn't anymore.
I figured, although I'm not terribly anxious to go out and get a tattoo (I'm way too over-cautious and afraid I'd regret it at some point) I could not get a tattoo from anybody who had <em>less</em> typography sensitivity than me.
If I got a tattoo with type, and there was a shape or kerning issue, it honestly <em>would</em> bother me literally every time I saw it. I figured if I were ever to get a tattoo, because of my high standards I'd want to go to the best tattoo artist I could find, and I imagine it would be very very expensive and require me to travel some distance to get there.
For my conscience's sake, do you know your artist has decent typographic sensitivity, enough to accurately reproduce your chosen piece? It's a fact that 40% of a tattoo parlour's business is covering up another tattoo artist's mistake. Those odds are just too high for me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Choosing your tattoo artist is serious business that wants to be seriously considered and researched. There are a lot of hacks out there, but a few artists who truly deserve the name.
Btw, this sad "create" tattoo looks like the ink is too deep in the skin, causing extra bleeding, apart from being crooked to begin with …
What you said about kerning is certainly true. I have a very abstract tattoo, actually in the same spot as on this image (inside of left wrist), which is basically a line of dots in varying sizes. One dot is quite a bit too far on the left, which used to bug me a lot (now it's just 'the way it is'); the tattooist had it even further out of line first, & when I complained, she protestingly got a ruler, measured it, & then looked at me and said, "Why do you see this? Nobody sees this! It was like HALF A MILLIMETER off!" I'm not going there again.
The Helvetica tat looks really nicely done, though. I mean, it IS Helvetica. :)</div>

Me too. Where did you get that figure of 40 percent? I'm turned off by the idea of altering my body in this way. What's inside counts for infinitely more. Anyway it's more fun doing shadow puppetry letters on the wall on a cold rainy evening with the help of a rusty old kerosene lamp ;^)

<div class=commentbody>so... mr hildebrant - did you get it done?
i have most of my right sleeve done, pics here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/armorath/sets/72157608087662106/
i don't have any type tattoos per se, but i do have some words, which i simply asked the tattooist to write, and i was happy with his style of writing.
i have thought about getting some proper type tatts, but i kinda like the idea that the letters on my body are designed just for my body...

<div class=commentbody>One of our authors just got his first book's ISBN tattoed on an arm. I set it for him in one of the OCR faces and he took that to the parlor. I have not yet seen it. Too cold here now: we all have our sleeves rolled down. Maybe in Spring I'll see it.

<div class=commentbody>To all of the naysayers out there: it is possible to be satisfied with a type-related tattoo; you just have to go to someone who knows what he's doing.
It looks even better than I had hoped for:

<div class=commentbody>I understand that it's taken from a passage in Cicero, but that doesn't mean that it makes any sort of sense. You gave me a translation of the entire passage, not of just that phrase. The phrase begins in the middle of a sentence, in the middle of a word (I'm not a Latin scholar, but I think that "em" is a suffix on "dolor"), and a conjunction is deleted. It's not a complete thought. It's like saying that "monds always reminded him fate of unrequited" makes sense because it's taken from a real passage of text (from <em>Love in the Time of Cholera</em> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez).
As far as I can tell, the actual translation of "dolorem ipsum..." is "pain itself it is pain"; never mind eliminating the "do". Tell me that "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" by itself makes any sense.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have to admit, I admire all of you who managed to find a typeface you could permanently use on your body. I would have such a fear that I would find one I liked, and then a month later see a font I had never seen before and wish I could do it over. I'm not sure if it is the fact that my font tastes just change too much, or perhaps the industry evolves too quickly.
For the longest time I have wanted to get my hometown scripted on the top of my foot. I am a native of Arizona, and there are literally like 7 of us left here. The problem? I can't decide on a font.</div>

<div class=commentbody>That's why I picked a Garamond for mine (specifically Garamond Premier Pro). I figure that if I'm going to have a typeface on my body for the rest of my life, it shouldn't be one that's going to go out of style any time soon. So why not use one that's 500 years old?
Although in retrospect I should have used the regular weight instead of the semibold. I thought the regular wouldn't have been hearty enough to hold up, but the bleeding of the tattoo causes it to thicken out a bit. So I guess I should have used the regular weight of the caption cut. But retrospection does not equal regret. I probably would have more regretted not getting a tattoo because I was agonizing over the font.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I realize this is a SUPER old post but hopefully the info here will be useful for others too.
My number one suggestion would be to talk with your artist. (or better yet, several artists to see who has the best understanding of type-centric pieces) Take several printed examples of the type you're considering and explain to them what it is about each typeface that you especially like. This way they can tell you how it's not really going to be possible to keep the integrity of the very fine lines in Bodini at 12pt but that perhaps going larger or with a similar, slightly heftier face will give a similar outcome.
Trust a good artist. They want you to be happy!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Nah, in the purest state the Artist only cares about self-expession.
(Fortunately for everybody the pure Artist does not exist.)

<div class=commentbody>I'm looking at different typefaces to do mine in and have settled on a slab serif of some sort and am leaning towards archer. The problem being that I don't own archer.
I'm hoping this isn't outside my boundaries to ask if there is anyone on here that would be willing to type out the phrase I want, outline it and send it to be in illustrator so I can lay it out the way I want it.
(don't shoot me if this is wrong of me to ask but I only have the best of intentions and wouldn't even begin to know how to any sort of duplication as I'm just a lowly graphic designer with no type design experience)</div>

<div class=commentbody>OK, inner curmudgeon showing through, but as nice as the the designs may be, to me, getting a tattoo is like tagging the Mona Lisa with a spray bomb. </div>

this is me. i NEVER thought i'd get a tattoo but now that i have mine i can't imagine not having it. it's def. not a rock star one like some of you have but i love it and it's perfect for me. it's a 100pt bell gothic comma. yeah it's a bit imperfect but what it represents for me is what matters. now, as far as perfection goes, i named my kid after a font. shazam.</div>
