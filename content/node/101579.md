  whether anyone could help me in finding a serif typeface for this sans. There is
  an slab-serif that is part of the family, but i don't have a desire to use it.\r\n\r\nI
  have found some possible options, but just wanted to sound out some other ideas.\r\n\r\nAny
  assistance is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n"
