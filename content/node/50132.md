  \ \r\n\r\n(SEE ARTICLES AT BOTTOM OF PAGE, \"A Side Note on Macintosh Computers
  and Text Readability\" and \"Zooming Reid Reviews With Macintosh OSX\") \r\n\r\nSo
  I turned to my favorite type guru for his expert opinion, Steve Matteson, Ascender,
  Corp.  He was gracious enough to answer and allow me to post his response:\r\n\r\n\"Hi
  Nancy,\r\n\r\nBoy you've really stepped in it with this one! :-) The skinny on this
  \ \r\nlink is that type on screen is truly a big fat mess. There's a lot of  \r\nbad
  speculation on this blog but a grain of truth. The variation of  \r\nrasterizers
  is much deeper than the author initially suggests.... he  \r\ndoesn't even mention
  Adobe applications which override Apple and  \r\nMicrosoft rasterizers to display
  type in their own preferred way  \r\n(their rasterizer is called 'CoolType'... don't
  ask why).\r\n\r\nIt's a terribly subjective topic - some prefer black and white
  and  \r\nothers prefer anti-aliased fuzz. Some just need new prescriptions for  \r\ntheir
  glasses. The arguments against black and white are that it is  \r\ntoo stark. Also
  that spacing suffers*. The arguments against anti- \r\naliased (gray scale) is the
  lack of edge definition. Microsoft Windows  \r\nuses ClearType and some people bitterly
  hate it because they are  \r\nsensitive to the color fringing. Microsoft has had
  independent  \r\nresearch done which quantifies the legibility of ClearType of anti-
  \r\naliasing. I think their claims were a 5% improvement in reading  \r\nperformance
  with ClearType.\r\n\r\nApple thinks they have the ultimate solution which needs
  no further  \r\nimprovement. They are putting no investment that I'm aware of in
  \ \r\nrefining type quality. Google and Microsoft kill Apple in side by side  \r\ncomparisons.
  Being a hardcore Apple fan this is terribly frustrating.\r\n\r\nFor Microsoft's
  part - the ClearType tuner gives you ability to fine  \r\ntune your system for the
  way type renders in non-Adobe apps.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pastedGraphic_3527.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  attachment with the 6 text blocks shows the range in settings. At  \r\nleast they
  realize that people see differently. Apple seems to rely  \r\nonly on Steve Jobs'
  personal reading glasses prescription.\r\n\r\nThe second attachment illustrates
  the same *exact* font data rendered  \r\nwith different rasterizers.... \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/screenfonts_6043.gif]\r\n\r\njust
  a 'for example' to prove that different rasterizers draw type \r\nvery differently.\r\n\r\n*spacing
  suffers because most applications choose to round high  \r\nresolution letter widths
  to pixels. The effect is sort of randomized  \r\nspacing - good at one size but
  not another. The alternative is to have  \r\nperfect spacing on screen which then
  is potentially/likely different  \r\nthan print (causing line breaks to occur in
  different places than on  \r\nscreen).\r\n\r\n\r\nWell I hope this helps.... someday
  I should write this stuff down....\r\n\r\nSteve\""

    font smoothing between operating systems for a majority of the population is splitting
    very small hairs. ;o)"

  body: "hi,\r\n\r\ni know what leading is but obviously the blogger does not.  what
    was interesting to me is that this showed up on a PHOTOGRAPY blog.\r\n\r\ni think
    steve matteson is correct, however, that perception is everything and there are
    many conflicting opinions on type readability on the web.  lord knows, the PRINT
    readability question is far from clear.  ellen lupton argues that readability
    is habitual (or conditioned,) that if i grow up reading black letter i would find
    it perfectly readable.  others do not share her view.  there are questions about
    the repetitive structure of the alphabet we use; so many characters repeat forms
    (b d, c o, h l p q, and etc.,).  but most researchers who actually spend time
    on readability issues are not typographers and typographers understand the LANGUAGE
    of type.\r\n\r\nwhat i think is that all of these issues are important.  think
    about type foundries mediating letterforms in metal, each one rendered according
    to their ability and pocket.   there were beautifully rendered cuts of type, and
    really lousy ones.  same with the shift to hot metal then cold.  what's going
    on right now is that there are (1) people who draw the type then people who write
    the software to manage it then (3) people who receive the type on zillions of
    devices that render it differently.  #3 is new.  so, now we need (4) someone to
    figure out what it how it should function with #3, and there is no \"canon\" to
    do this.\r\n\r\nyah, splitting hairs to some."

    that extent of a disclaimer is due to ignorance. Not in the 'he is stupid' sense,
    but rather just an ignorance of type in this case. Yea, the font smoothing can
    be an issue, but it's usually the lesser issue of all the issues that can make
    on-screen type a pain on the eyes.\r\n\r\n\"there are many conflicting opinions
    on type readability on the web\"\r\n\r\nCertainly."

    in the type industry pay attention, thanks. Starting in the late winter and early
    spring of '07, (when MS finally released a system with antialiased type on by
    default), you will find somewhere between 40,000 and 100,000 words on this topic
    right here at Typophile. The differences between Adobe, Apple and MS antialiasing
    were studied, quantified and discussed at great length. When the dust had cleared
    and the broken bottles of Yukon Jack and Mountain Dew were swept up:\r\nAdobe
    settled on, \"We are all just carbon/water balls tripping 'round the sun. Reading
    screens is inferior to print, why waste time?\"\r\nApple decided, \"People like
    it!\" (which means Jobs, which makes it plural, I guess).\r\nAnd Microsoft proclaimed
    proudly that, \"Readability is a software engineering problem, not a type design
    problem.\"\r\nI said and repeat, \"They all make modestly nice fonts for previewing
    print.\"\r\nThen, there were another 10,000 to 1,000,000,000 words discussing
    Microsoft's thinly veiled attempts at 'scientific studies' of reading and Cleartype.
    When the dust cleared from that, the U. of Michigan Business School, the iDocs
    Union and former students of MS's Behavioral Psychology Guru had to be swept up
    and tossed in the \"Oh Really!?\" bin. Then, most of the people with real skills
    and open eyes in this area of the field went off to help readers of systems used
    by a minority of users, which is working out quite nicely for all involved, whilst
    we wait...\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n"
