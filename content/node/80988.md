  of Olivetti logo designs by Walter Ballmer, and was curious if any of these were
  derived from a Ballmer typeface, or were they all just custom logotypes?\r\n\r\n[[http://farm1.static.flickr.com/64/226657248_8f9f60060b_o.jpg]]\r\n\r\n"

  body: Since the reliable and exhaustive Klingspor online type museum has no listing
    of Ballmer typefaces, I should think the latter applies...
