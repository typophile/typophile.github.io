  based off of...  I know the magazine uses variations of Miller through out, but
  I've been matching it up and there's no forms that match up to this, unless it was
  heavily customized...  I swear i've seen these Swashes before,  and insight?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The New York magazine masthead has been specifically designed for the merged
    newspaper of the New York Herald-Tribune, World-Telegram & Sun and Journal-American\u2019s
    Sunday magazine. It's based on [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bookman/|Bookman]]
    (Light Italic with Swash). Mark Simonson has recently released a beautiful revival
    of Bookman Old Style called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/light-italic/glyphs.html|Bookmania]]
    with tons of alternates and swashes characters. I believe you could get pretty
    close using his version."
