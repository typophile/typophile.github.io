  body: "I found this /S/ only in <strong>Aurora Script</strong> by Ivan Zeifert &
    Alexandra Gophmann (2005) but I'm not at all sure this is an original work.\r\n\r\nTake
    a look at what Luc Devroy says about Alexandra Gophmann:\r\n<blockquote>Russian
    designer of typefaces who collaborates with Ivan Zeifert and specializes in revivals,
    cyrillizations and beautiful digitizations, some of them done with Anatole Gophmann.
    There have been complaints about her practice of borrowing fonts from type designers
    without asking. One typophile writes: I have cracked open fonts she claims as
    hers, Bolero, Bickham and others, she has copied and pasted glyphs, copyright
    data, added Cyrillic and changed the copyright string.</blockquote>\r\nMore info:
    [[http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-43962.html]]\r\n\r\nIf you need to license the
    font for a project, I recommend to be extra careful and try to find if this is
    a rip-off of another commercial font before using it.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nI
    found it using \"Find my Font\": http://www.findmyfont.com"

title: Script S I cannot identify. May be a blend of multiple fonts?
