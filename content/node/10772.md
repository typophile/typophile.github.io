    <BR> <BR>Compressed, Condensed, Neue, Ultra Light... there are so many ways that
    it&#39;s good. And Helvetica is versatile, too... Nothing awkward about it, Helvetica
    manages to be utilitarian without being soulless. Though even the most virtuous

  body: 'I never used to care for Helvetica, but I didn&#39;t dislike it particularly
    either. It just wasn&#39;t an aesthetic I had any interest in. I always thought,
    and still think, that the use of Helvetica for text in wide columns on glossy-paged
    books of the early &#39;70s was hideous and unreadable, but as a heading and display
    face it seemed to work okay.  <BR>  <BR>Then I had the great pleasure of being
    commissioned to design a new Cyrillic, Greek and Hebrew for Helvetica, which obliged
    me to spend a lot more time looking at the design than I had previously. I&#39;m
    still not inclined to make much use of Helvetica, but I have a lot more respect
    for it than I used to. One of the things I really came to appreciate was the sheer
    quirkiness and unpredictability of what most people think of as a very rationalised
    and geometric design. It&#39;s actually pleasantly perverse.  <BR>  <BR>Note that
    I&#39;m talking here about the original Helvetica. Helvetica Neue is a completely
    different design: superior in almost every way, but much less quirky.'

  body: I think Helvetica is mostly a victim of its success. Designers get tired of
    seeing the same typefaces over and over. I can&#39;t think of any typefaces that
    have become as popular as Helvetica that have not had the same over-exposure problem
    with designers. I used to like Times Roman a lot more before it became a default
    font.  <BR>  <BR>As a young proto-designer in high school in the &#39;70s, I was
    infatuated with Helvetica. My first sheet of Letraset was a sheet of 72-point
    Helvetica Medium, and I remember marveling over the subtle curves or the lowercase
    <i>a, e,</i> and <i>s.</i> My design teacher in college said &#34;when in doubt,
    use Helvetica.&#34; I, like many others I think, imagined it as some kind of ultimate
    standard that all others were to be judged by; that it was a typeface with all
    the pretensions of style and ornamentation peeled away.   <BR>  <BR>I grew out
    of my infatuation &#40;or got bored with it&#41; within a couple of years as I
    became more acquainted with the charms of other typefaces. But I can still remember
    a time when I imagined that in a perfect world everything would be set in Helvetica.
    &#40;Ha! Heaven help us.&#41; <BR>  <BR>I mostly think it&#39;s boring now, though
    I find that the way it has come back into fashion is interesting, were it&#39;s
    brought to center stage again. I couldn&#39;t use it like that without feeling
    ironic. Helvetica used to represent end of style. Now it&#39;s just another style.

    onto its revivals of Bookman, Garamond, Cheltenham, Caslon, and Franklin Gothic.
    If you take the serifs off of ITC American Typewriter, you are left with Helvetica,
    more or less. You can see some of the same thinking in WTC Bodoni and WTC Goudy.

    and Morrisons demand that typography shouldn&#39;t get between author and reader.
    While I personally think that such a thing is unlikely to actually happen and
    also that it isn&#39;t wrong at all to get between those two and to interpret
    and act as a catalysator in the communicative process, it seems that Miedinger
    succeeded in making Helvetica very very invisible. I think it says a LOT about
    German companies that they&#39;re so in love &#40;or simply used to&#41; this
    typeface... and I think that as a designer we shouldn&#39;t take Helv as granted
    but look for alternatives... but sometimes there simply is none. I know of know
    other typeface, except maybe DIN that is as sterile and functional as Helv...
    And in a minimalist design you WANT a typeface to look that way. '

    the Foundry version, but the Neufville release doesn&#39;t wow me much, it&#39;s

    on the history of TV some years back and noticed that almost everything looked
    better designed and simpler and ... just moe beautiful... in the early days of
    TV as a mass-medium. The 50s/60s screendesign, although there were terrible poopers
    as well, it just felt more relaxed than the overcoloured overanimated stuff we
    have today.  <BR> <BR>By the way, most German TV-stations use Helvetica or something
    similar. The ARD uses the Thesis whole clan, which works surprisingly well on
    screen. Almost every show has its ID done in some of the Thesis fonts... and this
    gives us a coherent look yet still offers the single shows some individuality. '

    think Renner et al wanted the new typography of the 1920s as a concious statement

    Futura harkens back to the Capitalis Monumentalis in  that it is based on circles

    and ruler, not created in a more dynamic way by hand with a nib/pen. That is what
    I mean by sterile. Although the finished version, of course, is by no way as regid
    as the first designs &#40;the o, e.g., isn&#39;t just a circle anymore but rather
    returned to the slightly oval form we know since the 14th century to be optically
    correct, it still, imo, was a statement against the old-fashioned typography that
    went before the 20th century.  <BR> <BR>The digital Futura, btw, isn&#39;t too
    good for longer text, I think. The digial version needs a lot of manual kerning
    because of the geometric shape of the letters, and while with a LOT of manual
    editing you can get a decent looking text, it&#39;s just too much work to bother.
    Also, I tend to think that a more dynamic letterform is just more gentle on the
    reader :-D. I couldn&#39;t imagine reading a book or a lengthy article in Futura,
    even Helvetica would be better. '

    for reading. The long ascenders/descenders, geometric construction and incoherence
    of the letterforms lack flow and making reading very uncomforable. The text figures
    help, but not by much. <BR> <BR>&#60;i&#62;In the very &#34;Trajanian&#34; proportion
    of its caps, its quite  <BR>traditional vertical proportions &#40;small body,
    long extenders&#41;, Futura doesn&#39;t seem to me that  disconnected from a Renaissance
    lineage even.&#60;i&#62; <BR> <BR>I agree. The caps certainly owe a lot to the
    Trajan Roman caps &#40;and to the caps of Edward Johnston&#39;s Underground type
    and Gill Sans&#41;, but the lowercase to me doesn&#39;t say a lot about the Renaissance
    ? quite purely geometric. It&#39;s funny how Gill Sans really didn&#39;t catch
    on in continental Europe and North America in the 20/30s... people preferred the
    modernity of Futura, so Monotype made an &#39;alternate&#39; version of Gill Sans,
    but it really was just a close imitation of Futura... <BR> <BR> <BR>

    what Renner wanted to achieve: to reference classical proportions, and let the
