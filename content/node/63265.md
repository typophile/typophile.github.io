  been wondering about what font the so called \"designer\" used. I went through the
  families I thought were close but the \"p\", \"a\" and capital \"J\" didn't fit
  anywhere. Help? Thanks guys! \r\n\r\n(heck, I finally found a reason to register
  after lurking for years on end)\r\n\r\nFred\r\n\r\nPS: apologies about the quality
  of the photo, I had to use the iPhone to take it."
