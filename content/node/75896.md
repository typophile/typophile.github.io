    glyphs</a> and comes in 2 styles for $35 each, URW++ has a version with <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/microgramma/d-medium-extended/characters.html\">432
    glyphs</a> for $19.95 per style and offers an additional \u2018Only Shadow\u2019
    style. It has a wider language support and also a couple of OpenType features
    (e.g. fraction figures).\r\nAlso, the design is slightly different, most notably
    in glyphs like the \u20AC or the @.\r\nNote that there is also a <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/microgramma/\">version
    by Linotype</a>. Plus, see the extended style of the various <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eurostile/alternate_cuts.html\">Eurostiles</a>.\r\n"
