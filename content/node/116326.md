  body: "Logo dates perhaps as far back as 1954, when the company was founded. Have
    not yet found a font from the era or earlier that is an exact match. During the
    1950s the record companies used the services od photo lettering firms to distort
    typefaces --wider, narrower, lighter, heavier etc. . There may not be an exact
    match to the logo. The _o_ and _a_ almost look as if they were from different
    fonts. But at least one font has something similar.  Folio EF Bold Cond, designed
    in 1957, http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/folio/ Increase the rounding on the bowl
    of _a_ and you are at least in the ball park.\r\nThen again, it could be custom
    lettering for the logo.\r\nDon"
