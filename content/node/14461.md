  Typophile buddies and as a general warning to all residents of the state of California...
  I may be coming to a town near you! San Francisco residents need particularly be
  scared as I am making my new nest in the fine city of San Fran. You all may never
  be the same. I'll see you in September, MWAH-HA-HA-HA!

    the Bay Area type geeks will welcome you with open arms. Don't worry about missing
    the bash on the 20th, if you aren't here yet - there'll be plenty of other opps
    for getting together with the gang.

    I've been to Central Park many times and I live within walking distance from Prospect
    Park in Brooklyn. The difference is in comparison to where I'm from, there seem
    to be only \"designated places where nature is allowed\" in New York. Where I'm
    from, its just always there. You're lucky to find a patch of grass in a 10 block
    radius here in New York. "

  body: "Good choice, Terry! I'd encourage your efforts to improve BART, but BART
    and MUNI are the gateways to madness: every station is a jumble of conflicting
    type, signage, branding, and architecture. Looking around trying to figure out
    how to fix everything will explode your brain. I prefer to watch the mice scamper
    around underneath the tracks. It's soothing.\r\n\r\nAfter New York, San Francisco
    can seem a little parochial, but we have awesome sushi, <a href=\"http://www.amoebamusic.com/\">two</a>
    of the <a href=\"http://www.aquariusrecords.org/\">most</a> amazing record stores
    in the United States, if not the world, and some of the most freakishly unvarying
    weather I've ever seen (opinions vary on the last). Also, we have entertaining
    politics. And I guess we have the nature too, although the good stuff is further
    away than you might think.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, we have <a href=\"http://www.stoutbooks.com/\">William
    Stout</a>. Leave your wallet at home the first time you visit. I didn't, and I
    was sorry (although not very)."
