  Obviously I am just talking about the "CONVERSE ALL STARS" part, no worries about
  the "Chuck Taylor"[img:sites/default/files/old-images/converse_logo5_4048.jpg]

    in the same universe as the one being requested. Plus, that site is rather full
    of ripped off fonts, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I want to say Trade Gothic Extra
    Bold Condensed, but that's not right. Hmm. Such a simple one!"

    just roughly mimic the style, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_din_condensed_black/&sample_text=CONVERSE&sample_size=48\">DIN
    Condensed Black</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/alternate_gothic_no_two/&sample_text=CONVERSE&sample_size=48\">Alternate

    sure someone will come up with better suggestions."

  body: Anzeigen [Grotesk] Bold Condensed is close, but that R is still problematic.
    Also, it seems a but more condensed. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong Anzeigen.
    Anyway, I've been able to find several fonts that are similar that seem to be
    appropriate for the period, but that darn R keeps rearing its ugly head. Well,
    actually it's not ugly, but you get the idea.

    has a similar 'R' but none of the other chars match.\r\n\r\nIt's funny, I was
    just looking at a lot of these <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/extra-bold-ultra-black-fonts#impact\">Impact
    genre sans serifs</a> in prepping our extra bold fonts feature this week."
