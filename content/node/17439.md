  and I'm leaning towards the use of Clarendon Condensed (Bitstream), or something
  similar in style. Where I'm running into problems is with the ear on the g, as I'd
  like to remove it, but it really throws the character off. I'm not even sure that
  this is definitely the direction I want to go with the letter, however, I have yet
  to give it a running chance.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I was wondering if anyone might have
  any recommendations on how to properly remove the ear and rebalance the letter accordingly
  (if this is possible), or if there might be some other font that might be a better
  fit for my design (possibly something with a center balanced upper loop?).\r\n\r\nYou
  can find a character map of Clarendon Condensed here:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/clarendon/condensed/charmap.html\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help!\r\n\r\n"

    an \"italic\" g in upright weights. so you won't have any \"ear\" problems haunting

      Nice work; I'll keep it in mind, Stefan.\r\n\r\nTo the original poster... perhaps
      with a heavier face, the g's ear becomes less of a visual sticking point. Consider
      (esp. if used as a masthead) HTF Ziggurat?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/catalog/ziggurat/index.html"

    if this gets me over the hump. I think Ziggurat might be too heavy, as the name
    \"quiet light\" is leading me in an airier direction.\r\n\r\nJust out of plain
    curiousity, has there ever been a serif typeface designed without the ear on the
    g, or is this an impossibility due to an imbalance in the letterform because of
    the link between the loops?"

    in this vein? Possibly something condensed?"
