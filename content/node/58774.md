    what font is this? Do you know similar fonts that could work fine with House Gothic

  body: "Hi. This board is fine. Fonts on the web is really only limited to a few
    alternatives, as every person visiting your website must have the font installed
    to be able to see it. That is, unless you use techniques like Sifr (which is only
    really useful for headlines). While we're waiting for the technology, I'd like
    to recommend a few rarely used css font stacks (a list of alternatives, in case
    the first isn't present).\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Transitional serif:</strong>\r\n\r\n<code>font-family:
    Baskerville, Baskerville Old Face, MG Open\tCanonica, Times New Roman, serif;</code>\r\n\r\n<em>Baskerville</em>
    come bundled with OSX on a Mac.\r\n<em>Baskerville Old Face</em> come bundled
    with MS Office 07 and 03 on a Windows PC and MS Office 04 on a Mac.\r\n<em>MG
    Open Canonica</em> is our Ubuntu fallback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Modern serif:</strong>\r\n\r\n<code>font-family:
    Didot, Bodoni MT, Modern No. 20, serif;</code>\r\n\r\n<em>Didot</em> com bundled
    with OSX on a Mac.\r\n<em>Bodoni</em> come bundled with MS Office 07 and 03 on
    a Windows PC.\r\nThe same goes for <em>Modern No. 20</em>, additionally MS Office
    04 on a Mac. \r\n\r\nI'll post some more another time. Cheers\r\n"
