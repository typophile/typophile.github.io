  body: John, &#39;Classic spanish typefaces&#39; and &#39;latinamerican tradition&#39;
    are for the moment &#40;and sadly&#41; hard to conect. <BR> <BR>The Updike&#39;s
    book &#40;&#39;Printing types&#39;&#41; has an interesting chapter on historical
    spanish fonts. <BR>If you look for revivals, you can try looking for &#39;Pradell&#39;
    or &#39;Ibarra&#39; fonts, like the one of Andreu Balius. <BR> <BR>According to
    the Latinamerican &#39;tradition&#39; &#40;a very short tradition, I have to say&#41;,
    I think there are interesting things to look at in <a href="http://www.tipografia.cl"
    target="_blank">www.tipografia.cl</a> &#40;Australis&#41;, <a href="http://www.pampatype.com"
    target="_blank">www.pampatype.com</a> and <a href="http://www.letraslatinas.com/html_tex/a.shtml"
    target="_blank">http://www.letraslatinas.com/html_tex/a.shtml</a> <BR>&#40;However,
    in this last link you will find a mix of styles and quality... but this is the
    state of the latinamerican font scene today.&#41;
