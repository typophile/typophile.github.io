body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI've been drawing a blank trying to find out what the attached font
  is.\r\n\r\nIt was used by a swiss watch movement manufacturer on obsolete date indicators
  (the bit  that tells you the date in the little window on your watch dial) from
  1969 until around 1980.\r\n\r\nThey were printed on water slide transfers (decals),
  applied to a plastic wheel that frequently breaks. I'm looking to get replica tranfers
  made up, but can't work out what font was used.\r\n\r\nI've a (much) larger blown-up
  scan of the full wheel if  it helps?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\n"

    font to match. I don't know if it helps, but the closer I can find -based on the

    commissioning a type designer to make an exact replica; for just numerals the
    cost won't be prohibitive. If you go this route there are many people here who
    can do the job, including myself: hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    for a number of Swiss watch dial fonts with little success. Pity that."

  body: As in, not slightly similar at all? Numerals appear to be very different between
    the two (and you might note your involvement with Ernestine, Hrant)
