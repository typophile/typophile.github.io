  slab serif or this is just a bold family of modern serif? This one came from Dutch

  body: "In fact it looks a lot like [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/clarendon-extra-cond/|Clarendon
    Condensed]], definitely a slab serif typeface. (The font choice was just as an
    example. You can see other Clarendon Condensed fonts, by looking at Clarendon
    families.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
