  goes:\r\n\r\nHow do you deal with coding <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans\">orphans
  and widows</a> in HTML? I never used to think about this until I started working
  in my current job and the proofreader would mark up the widows. My quick fix is
  a <br /> tag before the last word of the sentence before the widowed line. My dilemma
  with this solution, however, is when text gets resized by the user (using their
  browser settings), the <br /> tag can move to the next line, thus prematurely breaking
  the line midway and making the paragraph appear disjointed.\r\n\r\nAny designers/front-end
  developers have an alternative solution to this?\r\n\r\nThanks muchly! :)\r\n\r\n"

    That job is left to CSS, or at least it is supposed to be if you're using idealized
    coding style standards.\r\n\r\nThe best I can think of to prevent widows and orphans
    is to substitute spaces between the last couple/few words of a paragraph with
    a nonbreaking space (& nbsp; without the space) to keep them glued together on
    the same line, though this might result in the preceding line having very few
    words there too."

  body: "As Cuttlefish said this is not the purpose of html. \r\n\r\nFor example,
    look through these forums and you will see widows and orphans everywhere - on
    a typography site. Just explain this to the proofer, there is no work-around that
    will have cross-browser and cross-platform coherency. Anything you do in this
    regard is only to make it look right on your own particular screen, and in all
    likelihood in one particular browser. Among other issues you will cause are problems
    for visually impaired users who need to scale text up or to have it read out by
    the computer.\r\n\r\nIf you must have your text conform to the rules of the (superior)
    world of print then place it as a static image or dynamic flash image. I wouldn't
    recommend this as you should work within the medium in its simplest form in order
    to alienate as few users as possible. "

  body: "@charles_e: That definition is certainly outdated, as Aluminum mentioned.
    Current web design best practice puts a lot of emphasis of using (X)HTML to define
    the <em>semantics</em> of content, rather than the display. While it was once
    common (and is still too common) to use markup in a presentational role, these
    days this is definitely frowned on by any decent web designer/developer.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    CSS will at some point bring decent typographic control to the web. But with the
    glacial pace of the CSS Working group, I wouldn't bet on it any time soon.\r\n\r\n[<a

    I know a bunch of web designers are using HTML in ways for which it it wasn't
    designed. Most of the people in the print world I know are moving toward XML for
    files that are to have multiple uses. For web display, those would be converted
    (using XSLT). In this model, HTML is still for *display*.\r\n\r\nI've always taken
    XML to be an extension of SGML -- that is, generic, unlike HTML."

  body: "It depends on what you mean by *display*. But yea, you're on the right track.\r\n\r\nxml
    = the content marked up via generic xml --> xslt = lets you transform the generic
    xml to a specific structur (in this case HTML) --> html = the markup language
    that tells the browser what the content 'chunks' are --> Web Browser = the *display*
    that will render the html using whatever default styles it wants to use --> CSS
    = the styles that are to override the browser's default styles to layout the page,
    style the type, add design elements (color, decorative images, etc.)\r\n\r\nTechnically,
    XML is a SUBSET of SGML, while valid HTML is an APPLICATOIN of SGML. But don't
    ask me to tell you what that actually means. ;o)\r\n\r\nOn top of that, many folks
    are using xhtml or, at least, xhtml syntax, which takes it back to being an SUBSET
    of SGML (as xhtml = xml).\r\n\r\nIn fact, newer browsers will allow you to use
    xml and css all by themselves to present and format in a web page. Not really
    the original intent, but viable.\r\n\r\nGoing all the way back to the original
    question...the reason you don't deal with widows online is that to have widows
    to begin with, you need a fixed canvas and fixed variables such a specific typeface
    and specific type size. You have control over this in print, buy you have no real
    control over it online. The end users can over-ride any design suggestions you
    may make. I can change the font, the size, the size of my browser, etc. So it
    becomes a rather futile thing to dwell upon.\r\n\r\nThe copyeditor might just
    be old-schooling it and marking up everything via habit so you can just ignore
    the elements that aren't applicable online. On the other hand, if they are insisting
    on things like this, then they need to get some basic training on how online typesetting
    works."

    that is so wonderful about a screwdriver: it IS also a pry bar, hammer, chisel,

    and repositioning apparantly outweighs the principles of good typography.\r\n\r\nBut

    be banished but orphans allowed. That's if you're referring to lines. If you're
    referring to words, the last word in a paragraph is only that.\r\n\r\nPeople keep
    talking about \"good typography\" as if the compositor allows the last word of
    a paragraph to fall on a line by itself out of laziness or ignorance. Usually,
    it is a matter of compromise. If you take down the last word -- or an even greater
    sin, hyphenate it, you also preserve close, even word spacing we all aspire to.
    Of course if you're allowed to edit the copy, you can make things fit, but in
    this case, what pleases a typographer will give an editor apoplexy.\r\n\r\nThe
    funniest couple of PEs I ever saw was \"PE--loose line, with a mark right beside
    it \"PE--hypenated last word.\" Well, even if you threw out all the wordspaces,
    that word wasn't going to go up. And the line sure wasn't going to get any tighter
    if you took the entire word down. Did I mention that it was a three-line paragraph?\r\n\r\nI
    know editors who apply the principle even to bibliographic entries, which are
    usually only two lines long. Where do they think that extra space is going to
    come from?\r\n\r\nMy rule of thumb is that however many words it takes, the last
    line of a paragraph should be longer than the paragraph indent of the following
    paragraph. Sometimes two words, such as \"of it.\" aren't enough."
