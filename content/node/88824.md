  body: "1. I would apply the circle effect on the logo before I rotate it. In that
    way the line of circles will match the line of the logo.\r\n\r\n2. The look of
    the circle effect is a little unprofessional/ Your graphic would look much cleaner
    (and also much more like a real logo) if you \"draw\" the circles yourself on
    adobe illustrator, or some other vector graphic software. Might take some time,
    but you will see that is worth it.\r\n\r\n3. The grandient effect is out of place.
    I presume you wanted to achieve a shadow effect. To do so, just dim the second
    logo (all of it and with no grandient).\r\n\r\n4. The easiest thing to change
    in a logo is the typeface that is used. While you pick, dont forget to pay homage
    to the original one.\r\n\r\nWork hard, and the result will really be beautiful."

  body: "to me - you have lost the original idea of the logo... the arrows creating
    an M - indicating the people coming to one place to create the university...\r\n\r\nsince
    heritage is proudly on display (1910) i can't help wonder if your modern twist
    sits awkwardly alongside\r\n\r\nhave you considered how the shirt will be manufactured?
    if it's screenprinting then the fade to white will look terrible and be very hard
    to control in process... resulting in dearer shirts and possible unusable/unsellable
    rejects. if you intend to use transfers - the longevity of print is compromised
    - the shirt will look crap in a few months after washing it a few times a month
    (hey - they are students!) also transfer prints tend to look 1970s/homemade...
    the shirt may not be popular with the students. \r\n\r\nyour designs deliberately
    take the logo off centre - so i am assuming it will need to be large/overall printing\r\n\r\nthe
    only clear way to make this design is dye sublimation... expensive - but they
    will print the logo onto the fabric before constructing the shirts out of it...
    but the target market may resist buying shirts at twice/three times the price"

    original logo \r\n\r\nIs this an official project that's authorized by the university,
    or just a personal project? Will the t-shirts be sold?\r\n\r\nMost universities
    do not want people making unauthorized variations of their logos, nor do they
    permit people to sell items (like t-shirts) containing their logo without purchasing
    a license from the university. If it's just some free t-shirts for a university
    event they probably won't care, but if you have plans to sell them, then you could
    get into legal trouble unless you have authorization.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine
    works for a university and his full-time job is to license use of their logo,
    and to seek out and stop unauthorized use of their logo, and it's an issue they
    take very, very seriously because university-branded merchandise generates a lot
    of money."

  body: "This is kind of funny.\r\n\r\nThe new Mount Royal logo is really nice, and
    was even picked as one of the top re-brands for 2011 on Brand New:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_best_and_worst_identities_of_2010_part_ii_the_best.php\r\n\r\nSurely
    you can work with the logo itself to make a nice piece of art.\r\n\r\nYou are
    using half-tones/dots and gradients/transparency, which is a bit confused I think
    as the two effects are really not meant to mix in the traditional sense. To achieve
    a sense of transparency with half-tones you make smaller and more spaced-out dots.
    Which would look more honest than throwing a ball of photoshop light at it.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, you can throw mutliple effects at it -- but it's the equivalent of mixing
    your metaphors. It's like a duck out of water, if you know what I'm saying.\r\n\r\nAlso:
    how does t-shirt art print with the transparency you're using? It doesn't if it's
    screenprinted. \r\n\r\nCan you take the base element of the logo (ie: one of the
    books) and build something out of that, in a modular fashion?"
