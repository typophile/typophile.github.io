  body: "I like the idea, but it needs some refinement to avoid the \"rendering error\"
    reaction.  May need to work a little on the balance. For example, the 'u' and
    'p' look good but the 'L' is lacking weight at the top to balance out the double
    serif at the bottom.  Also more definition of some of the serif transitions. The
    'c' right now looks like it just gets thicker and the 't' and 'r' blend a bit
    giving a muddled look.\r\n\r\nGreat idea though and you should run with it.  If
    you stuck, print it out and stick it in your bag for a few weeks.  Let your brain
    run in the background until an idea strikes."

  body: Designing a face with rendering errors is equivalent to designing a distressed
    face. Mind you, most look like crap because they don't consider how the effect
    works in context (in a word, or in a sentence), but a selected few still hold
    up. If you want to walk down that road, you could look into the effects of digital
    distortion and maybe also printer errors.

  body: "This is starting to look very promising! The 1 degree is also an improvement.\r\n\r\nI
    think the serifs on the 's' are too big though. I see you essentially rotated
    the serif of a stem, which might be the best solution to avoid giving the 's'
    the appearance of a more or less normal serif letter, but I don't like the inconsistency
    in regard to other letters; I think it will look more consistent if the serif
    has the same length and angle. The same counts for the 'a'. I think the 'r' is
    the only exception I'm comfortable with in your typeface as its arch resembles
    the downstroke of the 'm'.\r\n\r\nAlso, I see you're applying the serifs to most
    of the letters which would normally feature serifs, though I personally think
    the serifs are so prominent that it contrasts too much with the serif-less letters.
    'e' usually has no serif but I think you did good by adding one. I think I would
    also add such a serif to the 'g' and definitely to the 'c' (what's your reason
    for excluding the serif on a letter which usually feature serifs?).\r\n\r\nThe
    'o' is a tough one. It's just too smooth and clean compared to the other letters
    (as is are 'c' and 'g' but as I mentioned those are easily fixed). I think I would
    actually make the stroke go inwards a bit at the top instead of a closed circle.
    A bit more calligraphic. On the other hand, that will make it deviate too much
    from 'd' and perhaps even other letters with a rounded top. Maybe add a little
    serif kind of thing which kind of resembles the ear in a spectacle 'g'? Just to
    have a bit of a weight build-up there."

    misinterpretation of hrant's comment) is quite an improvement on the former design,
    though those curves might not be necessary if you follow hrant's idea.\r\n\r\nI
    also like the last version with the curves. In that regard I disagree with hrant
    that this typeface needs hard straight lines but I think right now you really
    need to establish which direction you want to take this typeface in. Also, this
    might be a rubbish idea but perhaps it's nice to vary a bit in serif style between
    Regular and Italic (if you plan to make an italic); for example rely on those
    hard straight lines in Regular as hrant suggests, and introduce those curves from
    the last picture you posted in the Italic."

  body: I like the basic shapes but your slant is too severe. The stem of the /i/
    almost looks like a /z/. I think you also have too many diagonal angles. Straight
    slabs like in Hrant's picture will work better. In your picture there's too much
    contrast between the serifs and the main strokes. I think it's quite worthy of
    a concept to pursue when done "right".
