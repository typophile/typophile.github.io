  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Being that it's the holidays and there may be more than a few of us trolling around looking for topics to dig into, I thought up a juicy topic that may or may not have already been covered but I think it's worth further discussion regardless . . .

As OpenType gives us the auto ligature feature, it occurred to me, what are the MOST useful ligatures that I could add to my fonts . . .

Now, before I throw this out there, I'm already throwing out the common ffl ffi ae oe deal because how often can one eat a waffle while reading an encyclopaedia?

And to further up the ante, I'm thinking this in reference to more display oriented designs rather than text faces . . .

I'm looking for good common substitutive ligatures that can give the effect of non-repeating forms such as oo, ll, ee, and ss, etc . . .

Ideally, I'd like to come up with a top 10-20 that would be a standard for most fonts . . .

At worst, any fonts you can point to that may feature a thoughtful approach would also make for good fodder . . .

Cast away . . .

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Stuart,
I think ligature use is determined more by the type of font in question. I've been working on an antique style handwriting font lately. In handwriting, forms are predominantly connected. Most connections can occur smoothly in the same place. I find that letters whose stroke end at the top such as o v w and sometimes b often work best with ligatures. w_h is one that seems to flow better that way. I don't always make ligatures for double letters as contextual substitution seems to cover that well enough. Exceptions to that are usually combos with crossbars like f_t t_t or things like oo. Sometimes I get tempted into spicing things up a bit and include ligatures that are for beginnings only. 

All this is assuming we're talking about Open Type ligatures as opposed to creating a 2nd PS version with extras. If you go too wild with ligatures you have to watch out for conflicts. For instance, if you have both o_o and o_n you might consider an o_o_n ligature to be first in line.
Hope that helps ...not exactly a list.

Hi Stuart---Ray Larabie has made a quite a few OT fonts loaded with discretionary ligatures that may be worth your while checking out:

Neuropol ligatures is one giant ligatures font from the pre-OT era, but the pairings are closely related to the Neuropol structure.

>As for suggestions on novel ligatures, look for combinations where ordinary letters would collide, particularly in the descenders, g_j, g_y, g_g, j_j, and almost anything preceding j.

That's been one of my main uses of ligatures, for collision avoidance, and pairs that normally have poor fit like r_a.

		<div class="commentbody">I would echo what was said about intent being key. If you want to make a silly/fun/expressive/threatening/(insert your display description here) font more so then what you choose to ligate & why is completely different than if you are making a text face. 

So I guess I am saying that building a laundry list isn't what I would suggest. 

Also contextual substitution might be a better route in some cases because it leaves the fonts free to be rough ridden more evenly by designers ( take that! ya!).  Whereas a ligature will just break the word when they track it out at 200 or whatever they decide is needed. And a contextual sub can be made to build a ligature if it's really needed. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really wish to see a text face with a solution for f+umlauts.
In German language, ‘fä’, ‘fö’ and ‘fü’ are anything but rare, just think of ‘für’ [‘for’].
In a lot of classic serif faces the drop of the ‘f’ reaches out quite far to the right. That’s why there are ligatures like fl, ff, fi – to avoid collision, right?

So, dear type designers: before doing fancy things like including ‘ffj’ and ‘ſſl’ ligatures, 5 different ampersands and a truckload of ivies, please consider addressing this umlaut issue!*

See this illustration:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/f-umlaut_4616.gif]
Yellow is (to me) only just acceptable, red isn’t anymore.
And, of course: the bolder, the more clotted it gets.

By the way, I didn’t pick 4 fonts by Adobe because they were especially ‘bad’ – no, this problem is inherent to all faces that have an extensive ‘f’. I used these fonts as they are commonly regarded as being – in all aspects – very well equipped OpenType text fonts – and <em>still</em> suffer from this particular issue.

In my humble opinion, merging the ‘f’ drop with the left dot of the umlaut (as in ‘fi’) can’t be the way to go – that would look really awkward. I’d love to have an alternative ‘f’ with a narrower top for those cases, preferably with automatic substitution, via the lig feature.

And while doing so, don’t forget the triple combinations :°)
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/affaere_6019.png]

I don’t think this problem is limited to German language; the Swedish among others will benefit aswell.

It is also true that the solution I am advocating ( two glyphs ) no matter how skillfully made can be made visually broken by too much tracking as well. I guess I just think it's a better model because it has a chance at least to be more resilient. But your point about actual implementation being 'all' is bang on.

I suppose what I really wanted to know was if you thought there was any inherent superiority to the one glyph model & if so why. But it sounds now like you wouldn't take that position. Is that right?</div>

But what if prior to any tracking going on you could have uterly identical shapes? Admittedly it might be that some kinds of designs wouldn't be amenable to this - but just for the sake of argument - if you could get a lig that was visually identical - then I think the reason for 1 glyph ligs evaporates.* Do you agree? Feel free not to! 

With one important exception: Backwards Unicode compatibility. But you could include a glyph with out using it in your replace functions!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry. I didn't realize how opaque some of this was. I will do my best. 

In the case of backwards compatibility I am saying that a text can be hard-encoded to include the glyph for ff or fi for instance. And if you had a text like that you could loose the meaning of the text if you didn't include the single unicode glyphs 'ff' or 'fi' in your font. 

On the other hand, if you had a common sort of text - the sort we set 99.9 % of the time - with fand i or fandf indicated as separate glyphs you could allow the ff & fi to interpreted into the visual appearance/shape of a classic ff or fi ligature but using coding to make two glyphs overlap. 

And as far as why you would want to - a regular one glyph ligature often looks quite wrong with only fairly minor tracking. 

So.. one solution to that ( apart from not tracking a font )  is that as a font designer you could contrive a design that let the shapes ( within a tight range probably ) to flex in tracking right along with the other letters. Then inter letter spacing wold be consistent. 

Probably the best thing to do is to make a visual reference! I have been meaning to make a stab at one for some time in order to see what results were possible. And to see what the practical limitations might be.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>James; what’s your take on this? Does what I am talking about make sense to you?</em>

Yes. Everything you talk about makes sense to me. 

In 25 words or less: OT positioning commands can make up ligatures "on-demand" from a library stocked with a range of glyphs to suit different tracking conditions. 

That's 23 words. 

Tiffany---<em>I want the ligatures to belong to the design...because the design calls for true integration of the shapes.</em>

That can be done with Eben's scheme. Custom parts that integrate on an intuitive aesthetic basis. It would take some planning tho. It's only a matter of egineering it into existence. 

I put caps spacing programs into my OT fonts, a kind of in-built tracking feature using simple positioning commands. The one piece capital ligatures are designed to work with what I determine are the best or most useful tracking settings.

Oddly enough so do i in a way. And it's true that some kinds of designs could not be made any less brittle with a two glyph model than they are with a one glyph model. But I am betting that many could be made better. Still, as you say it's "in the pudding". 

Thanks for your comments James!

I will try to get a visual example to post sometime this week. What examples would be the most convincing for you Tiff? What about you James? And by this I mean what ligatures and what source fonts?  

BTW if you mean technically "dangerous" then no worries. There are perils but technical perils are the very very least of them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As I learn German since 2006, I've encountered some things that disturbed my eyes in German texts : the lack of NECESSARY ligatures that makes the text pleasant to read. Just like Florian Hardwig explained it very well above in the thread : the glyphs (f+umlaut) are often in collision. Since the beginning of the metal type, the type designers have created special ligatures in order to avoid these problems. Unfortunately this scheme applies only for a few languages today. Since a long time, I was asking to myself : Has a designer created a typeface with such ligatures already ?

Today I discovered Ingeborg, by Typejockeys. It has won the TDC awards in 2010. And it has those special ligatures.
I was amazed !

After reading the thread you created Florian, I conclude that merging the f's drops with the first umlaut's drops gives the f too height in comparison of the 'standard' f. It's like an arm that tries to catch an object (ball) out of reach !

No!! This is a compound word: Schiff-fahrt. An established rule says that you must not use any ligature across word boundaries.
Apart from that, Schiffahrt with 3 f’s is dull new age spelling, no decent German.
But that’s another thread ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Stuart,
On the Lobster, I have put the 'fina' into the 'liga', so the 'fina' is turned on by default. Also included in the 'liga' all the ligatures that you will normally put in 'calt', since I believe that they need to be turned on by default too.</div>
