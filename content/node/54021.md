  body: "Hi Michael!\r\n\r\nThanks, you are right!\r\nSeems incredibile how my opinion
    of this typeface had changed since I have seen the other letters.\r\nThe word
    Vermeer is so beautiful an inspiring. The typeface for me isn\u2019t. :-(\r\nWhat
    do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\nStefan\r\n\r\nAre you designing types for
    yourself?"

    kerning/spacing of Vermeer seems a bit off. \r\n\r\nSomebody knows the Italic
    used here, i'm really curious? I think it feels great (giving the necessary warmth
    \"to the paper\") in combination with the pretentious Koch Antiqua."

    really so interesting to me if the letters are inspired.\r\nYet you are quite
    right, I think, too, the combination is great deal of it!\r\n\r\nHave you remarked
    the striking beautiful upper serif of V on the right?\r\nAnyone round here who
    knows the significance of the letter V? ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments!\r\n\r\nLove
    typophile\r\nyou guys are great!\r\n\r\nStefan"
