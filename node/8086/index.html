At that time, if they were published at all, they would have been, I believe, delivered as photostats for use as part of a mechanical or in film for photocomposition.

		<div class="commentbody">What thorns do is very different from what traps do. I've not found thorns of use in digital type, but then I &ndash; like most of our colleagues &ndash; are making type for use in a wide range of reproduction technologies. Thorns may be useful in some specific printing processes; I don't know. But the likelihood of their being visible &ndash; not what you want &ndash; in other processes seems too great to recommend them as a general feature. <BR> <BR>All photo and mechanical processes distort letterforms to some degree, even from digital type. So when you go from file to film to plate, or direct to plate, you can see the affect of these processes if you look closely enough. But two things need to be kept in mind. The first is that the different processes and the variables in the individual process make it very difficult to predict what might happen to a letterform; so most digital type design is process-independent; i.e. it tries to provide the best result possible across a wide range of output and reproduction processes. If you know the specific processes that a typeface will go through, it is much easier to optimise the design for those processes. Which leads to the second thing to keep in mind when considering thorns: the rounding of corners in phototypesetting systems was much more pronounced than the impact of digital imagesetter or other output device, so the need for specific correction was much greater. Because individual companies manufactured their own machinery and processes, they could tailor such corrections very specifically to these devices. So I would expect that thorns on Berthold phototypes might differ from thorns on the types of other manufacturers. In the device-independent digital font world, we've largely had to give up that level of control, since we can't anticipate the machines on which fonts will be used or processes to which they will be subjected.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't know how &quot;different&quot; thorns are from traps, but it does seem that the latter tend to be more visible, so they need to be applied more gently. <BR> <BR>One thing though: when you print in reverse, things flip around! :-) So in superfamilies with special negative weights for example I can see thorns gaining more relevance - especially if they happen to have traps in the positives. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
