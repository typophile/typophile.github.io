    is supposed to be applied to the relevant fraction string, not to entire paragraphs.
    In so far, there's no real advantage of a slash-backward approach. Only the already
    mentioned disadvantage that the number of possible numerator digits is limited.\r\n\r\n(Miguel,
    it looks like this will switch to numerators only if there are <cite>at least</cite>
    four digits before the slash; and if there are more, <cite>only</cite> the four
    digits directly before the slash will become numerators.)\r\n\r\nKarsten"

    built in to a style sheet and applied to whole stories.\r\n\r\nThus, numbers composed
    of whole integers, such as dates, money, page number references, etc., will remain
    \"non-numeratored\", and only \" integer+(figure-slash-figure fraction)\" will
    require individual attention, which is the way it is supposed to be now anyway.\r\n\r\nIn
    North American newspapers and magazines, for instance, this would work for baseball
    reports, which are full of statistics, and the only text requiring manual adjustment
    would be \"pitched 5 1/3 innings\", where the fraction feature would have to be
    de-selected for the \"5\".  Even there, inserting a hair space between integer
    and fraction (as certain Typophilers are wont) does away with the need to edit
    the feature setting.  "

  body: "I understand. For a particular client who knows about possible limitations
    this may be ok. Couldn't you check some text samples with them: for recipes maybe
    you can limit fractions to one numeral before the fraction-slash; I think what's
    needed is simple things like 1/8, 1/16 etc. Then they need not care for 1 1/2
    -- though typographically Nick's hair/thin space solution is even better.\r\n\r\nExtending
    Nick's example, you could add a bit more contextuality and move it into a separate
    lookup:\r\n\r\nfeature frac {\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# first step, substitute
    slash with fraction,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# but only if it's inbetween two
    numerals,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# and if it's not a date:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lookup

    @NUMERALS slash; # exclude 2/12/07\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore
    sub slash @NUMERALS @NUMERALS slash'; # exclude 2/12/07\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore
    sub slash' @NUMERALS slash; # exclude 9/1/2007\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignore
    sub slash @NUMERALS slash'; # exclude 9/1/2007\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    @NUMERALS slash' @NUMERALS by fraction;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} step1;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
    only then substitute numerators/denominators:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lookup
    step2 {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# below I omit the
    additional contextuality given in Nick's example\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
    since we cared for these contexts in lookup \"step1\" already:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
    (A)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# only one numerator digit:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    @NUMERALS' fraction by @NUMERATORS;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#
    (B)\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub [fraction @DENOMINATORS]
    @NUMERALS' by @DENOMINATORS;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} step2;\r\n\r\n} frac;\r\n\r\n(A)
    If you want to allow for two numerators (but then the typographer definitely has
    to use hair/fine spaces in some cases), you add one line:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    @NUMERALS' @NUMERALS fraction by @NUMERATORS;\r\n\r\n(B) If you want to restrict
    the number of denominators to two, the last line should look like this:\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sub
    [@NUMERATORS fraction] [fraction @DENOMINATORS] @NUMERALS' by @DENOMINATORS;\r\n\r\nSame
    caveat as for Miguel's example [I like the idea: frame numerator-fraction, then
    substitute the other numerators inbetween!].\r\nThe more specific a feature gets,
    the harder it is to anticipate cases in which it shall NOT be applied. A feature
    only sees a glyph sequences but not their meaning.\r\n\r\nSorry for another long
    post."

  body: "I had a brief e-mail conversation with Tal Leming a couple months ago about
    just this sort of thing. Even though the OT spec recommends that {frac} be applied
    only on an as-needed basis to a limited string, I felt that there were plenty
    of occasions where it would be more desirable to be able to apply it globally
    and then manually turn off only the few exceptions. James's cookbook scenario
    is just the sort of thing I had in mind. Tal's trial solution was similar to the
    one Nick put forward. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the thing I brought up to Tal (and
    something which is implied by Nick's 5 1/3 example) is that editors will naturally
    input a space to separate integers and their related fractions, whereas in typesetting,
    you generally don't want an intervening space. Deleting those spaces manually
    is a tedious layout task. To eliminate the need for manual adjustment, Tal devised
    a substitution that replaced a space that follows a figure and precedes a numerator
    with a special \"fraction space\". \r\n\r\nI'd have to go back and find the e-mails
    to recall the exact code. This was just a theoretical exercise, since I didn't
    have a specific font or client in mind -- only a common situation that I'd run
    into many times that I thought might be solvable. I haven't had occasion to fully
    test Tal's sample code or implement it. \r\n\r\nBut the \"fraction space\" issue
    is actually separate from the \"global fractions\" issue and I think worth considering
    as an inclusion in a more conventional {frac} implementation, so that a designer
    could include the leading space when applying the {frac} feature in the standard
    manner, thereby eliminating the space in typeset presentation, but leaving it
    in the underlying text encoding, so that if the material gets repurposed into
    another format (one without proper fractions) the intervening space remains to
    indicate the difference between eg. 1 5/16 and 15/16.\r\n\r\n-- K."

  body: "As you say, typing the space-between makes sense editorially, as it distinguishes
    between 1 1/16 and 11/16 etc.\r\n\r\nEven if that is not a universal practice,
    it doesn't hurt to make the transition from manuscript fractions to typographic
    fractions an automatic, in-font OT feature, except that...\r\n\r\n...if the OpenType
    solution mentioned here is not universally applied to fonts, there will be problems
    changing fonts. Suppose you have a document set in a font which automatically
    removes the space-between, and switch to one that doesn't -- the typographer/editor/proofreader
    will have to be really on the ball to catch the few instances in text, in say
    a cookbook, where the space jumps back in.\r\n\r\nTherefore I would say this technique
    should only be used in proprietary fonts, not retail fonts.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAnother
    treatment of the space-between has been mentioned by CharlesE in this forum --
    I recall he reworks fonts to add kerning between integers and numerators, and
    that's something I'm starting to put in fonts."

  body: "Yes, you could either substitute the space between numeral and numerator,
    maybe even taking into account a fraction following the numerator(s) -- which
    however blows up the feature code for just a little effect.\r\nOr, you could solve
    this by positioning and reduce the space's advance width. The contextual rule
    would have to be the same as the one used for substitution.\r\n\r\nRegardless
    of the implementation, this may be considered a border case. Is this still kerning,
    i.e. a spacing correction, to be applied by default? Or does it belong to what
    I call \"typographic spacing\" which also includes adding space before colon,
    semicolon, exclamation and question mark, etc? This then would be optional and
    be covered in a different feature than \"kern\"."

  body: "In my experience, manuscripts from different clients come in with various
    formatting. The usual way we get fractions in a MS is closed up to the number,
    frequently coded. I imagine we do a lot of things differently from some users;
    we strip most all coding out of the typescript (MS), and we recode or put in a
    lot of InDesign tags with EditPad Pro -- including the code for fractions. The
    reason is that most manuscripts coming in via Word are a jumble of general styles
    and direct formatting; best to get rid of it & start over.\r\n\r\nWe also don't
    concern ourselves about anyone trying to recover text from a PDF; instead, the
    assumption is that any \"repurposing\" will be done via exported & reworked XML
    files. \r\n\r\nMore to the point, it is hard for the type designer to know just
    how the font will be used; to cover all bases, a lot of features would have to
    be written. One of my pet grumbles -- how can a type designer know just how the
    font will be used? Traditionally, it is the users of type who make these decisions."

  body: In InDesign we ran into this issue fairly early because the first OpenType
    fonts at Adobe with 'frac' just had a simple ligature-like substitution for the
    basic fractions which could be applied globally. Later, after it was decided to
    switch to a more generic implementation in the fonts there was a fear that some
    documents would be set with 'frac' applied this way (like a cookbook).  We talked
    about trying to be more intelligent about applying 'frac' selectively under the
    hood, but decided we didn't want to start second-guessing when & where to apply
    OpenType features. Fortunately, back then we had a much smaller user base. Similar
    issues existed with the 'ordn' feature, at least in earlier font implementations.
