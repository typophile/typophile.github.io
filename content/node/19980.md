  NOBODY'S 'POOL\r\n\r\n\r\nTALKING about the misery of Iraq on Sky News's Adam Boulton
  show, Heather Mills McCartney was her usual self.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassionate. Committed.
  Hard as nails. Fake as a nine-bob note.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long has Heather had a Liverpool
  accent? Was it a wedding present?\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes she have a pre-nuptial agreement
  with Sir Paul that means she gets custody of the accent in the event of a divorce?\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe
  this bolt-on accent is sub-conscious, a way of deepening her bond with hubby.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Heather Mills McCartney is the only person I've ever
  seen who makes Jimmy Tarbuck look like a soft Southern cissy.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/heathernude_6347.jpg]\r\n\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/2031333.stm"
