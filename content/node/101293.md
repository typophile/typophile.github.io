  on my homepage, I would like to use a CSS equivalent of this font............\r\n\r\nI
  am searching on Google fonts and cannot find something exactly like it, as you guys
  are experts in this can you help.........\r\n\r\nAlso does there exist a chart on
  the web where you can find the font in Photoshop which correlates to Google Fonts,
  it would save a lot of time........\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\nAnt"
