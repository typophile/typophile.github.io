  community was. \r\n\r\nI recently joined both the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2391073772\">Facebook</a>
  group and the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/typophile/\">Flickr</a> group.
  The first of which has about <em>240</em> members (at the time of this post) and
  the other <em>516</em> (also at posting time.) \r\n\r\nIt raised a small question
  in my mind... <strong>Just how big is Typophile?!</strong>\r\n\r\nAnyone know or
  want to give your guesstimate? Should Typophile have a resolution to expand (or
  contract?) By the way, I don't have any control over anything Typophile does, I
  just thought it would be an interesting question.\r\n\r\n<em>This is shameless,
  but feel free to add me as a Facebook friend</em>"

    creates an environment where only people who post create accounts. The number
    of readers is much larger than 25,000 but it's also true that there are likely
    to be a percentage of duplicate, old and unused accounts in the registered users
    pool. \r\n\r\nIf we applied the 80/20 rule here would suggest that 20% of the
    people post 80% of the content and the rest of the traffic is from unregistered
    users. That is in line with past numbers, but we haven't run the site metrics
    for a while."
