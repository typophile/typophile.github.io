    <BR> <BR>I only have the English version which of course is different from the
    original from 1928 which probably was Akzidenz Grotesk &#40;or B&uuml;cher Grotesk
    or Royal Grotesk if I am not completely wrong&#41; as Yves said. <BR> <BR> <BR>In
    this case though: <BR> <BR>Frutiger is used on the cover. <BR> <BR>Inside is Frutiger
    for headlines. And something that isn&#39;t Univers for body but bears a resemblance
    to it. And since this is what you probably wanted to know I am sad to say that
    I don&#39;t know it.'

  body: By the way... I find the book very irritating to read. <BR>The type is extremely
    light and the paper is very glossy which means that if I try to read this book
    with any kind of lighting nearby I am blinded by the dazzling reflexion from the
    insanely bright paper and the type is lost in what seems to be a nuclear blast
    of a backlight. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> <BR>Just my opinion. <BR> <BR>mg

  body: 'Well, the &#34;California&#34; edition of 1998 contains &#34;A Note on the
    Book and it&#39;s Design&#34; &#40;!&#41; -- ... has attempted to follow the author&#39;s
    original page layouts and design precepts as closely as possible. Aurora Grotesk,
    shown in the Berthold Photoypes E1 catalog &#40;1974&#41;, was identified as the
    typeface closest to that used in the original German edition; this typeface, however,
    had not been digitized at the time the California edition was produced. The text
    was set in 7.75 Image Light Extended with a 11.6 point leading. The typeface was
    revised by extending its overall set widths by 112 percent; character spacing
    was expanded to a Quark XPress tracking value of 16.&#34; <BR>rest of fonts: Frutiger
    Ultra Black. <BR>The &#34;shiny&#34; paper was selected to match the original
    edition... haha! <BR>I think I have a fascimile edition of the original German
    edition somewhere, but don&#39;t know where. Sorry.'

  body: You are completely right. I just flipped through to the back of the book...
    there it is in black letters on shiny bright white paper.  <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
