  body: I think Quark is a goner. InDesign has an indisputable edge in that the top
    two graphic design applications in the world -- PSD &amp; AI -- are its cousins.
    <BR> <BR>Also I think a lot of designers who used Quark on a daily basis in the
    late &#39;90s felt let down by the &#34;upgrades&#34; Quark put out between 4.1
    and 6. I mean, there was a period of five or six years when we got nothing. Quark
    just took their kazillion dollars and sat on it. The only reason they put out
    6 was that they needed a version that would run on OSX. As a daily user of Quark
    6.0 &#40;pity me&#41; I  can tell you it&#39;s not all that different than 4.
    <BR> <BR>I can make it work. It still does what it was intended to do. But a combination
    of lack of innovation and ID&#39;s easy compatibility with other Adobe products
    make me much more likely to use ID than Quark when the choice is mine.

    implemented in InDesign or Publisher. Particularly, if they hope to get JSTF or
    JALT support for Latin script fonts.

  body: IMHO--I used to be the biggest Quark advocate on Earth.  I had been using
    it since version 1.0.  After a while, it became clear that Quark felt it had the
    market so locked up that it could do nothing and rake in money anyway. They felt
    they could screw their customers time-after-time with bad upgrade policy and dump
    out buggy software after years of wasted time.  Frankly, I just don&#39;t trust
    Quark anymore.  They have created a self-inflicted cancerous lesion on themselves
    which has festered into a total-body eruption. Their only prayer is if someone
    else would by XPress who actually cares and turn it into a viable product.   <BR>To
    answer your question, I would not touch 7 with a 10 foot job stick. <BR>Quark
    is dead; long live InD. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: I agree with John B. The soundtrack for the utter disappointment that the
    v5 and v6 &#34;upgrades&#34; brought was indeed the fat lady singing. When they
    released v6 for OS X, I looked, but felt that the price for upgrading from 4.1
    was a complete insult.  <BR> <BR>IF they have good OT support, and IF they have
    a reasonable upgrade price for v4.1 users &#40;i.e., $150&#41;, I might consider
    upgrading. However, InDesign and TeX have been great for me over the past two
    years and fewer and fewer clients are demanding Quark.

    <BR>I still do have one client, an anarchist publisher in Northern Cali, that
    requests all books in Quark 4 and are not looking into upgrading or switching
    and so being the obedient person that I am, I continue to keep Quark 4 on my machine.
    If, however, they so much as hint about switching to Quark 7, I will do my utmost
    to get them to switch to InDesign because that is what I do use now. <BR> <BR>I
    recently spent a little over an hour on the phone with a Quark rep. They really
    wanted us to upgrade and were willing to upgrade even our non-upgradable versions
    just to get us to do it. I told them if we did any upgrading it would only be
    for two machines. Not even a drop in the bucket really. But they&#39;ve offered
    us the deal twice now. I wonder how many larger &#40;by quite a lot&#41; companies
    are getting deals phoned in to them.

  body: When I was In Phoenix recently looking for work I went in to two places where
    they were still using Quark. I went in to the Arizona Republic and they had me
    test on Quark 4 and I bombed partly because Quark isn&#39;t as intuitive to me
    as InD after using Adobe products for so long &#40;and partly because i was in
    a car wreck on my way to the testing!&#41; <BR>I went in and worked for a print
    shop for a week or so and they were using Quark 6, which is an improvement upon
    4, but still not as easy to use as InD. I don&#39;t think I personally will ever
    buy any version of Quark, but may have to pick it up sometime in the future...
    if so, i dread that day! <BR>But to address your initial question, I do think
    that there is a substantial percentage of the design market that is stuck in the
    Quark habit and just hasn&#39;t discovered the wonderful world of InD.

    monster job and found Indy would bog down. Granted, there are some odd embedded
    files. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I had to redo the package in Quark 6 to get it out the
    door. <BR> <BR>Clearly Adobe is the market leader, but with thousands of legacy
    files in Quark and workflows in place, I can&#39;t say I really care that much.
    <BR> <BR>Indy does sometimes feel a bit slower to me. I do love the text handling
    and PDF workflow that seems much more solid when you only work with Adobe.

    will be meeting Quark reps I recall your mention of it in another post . . .  <BR>
    <BR>Having retired Quark with my print ad agency years in the mid-90s I no longer
    use any desktop publishing software and if I need to make a piece, it can usually
    be done in Illustrator . . . <BR> <BR>I digress . . . As a foundry, I have been
    a technology watcher for many years waiting for an appropriate adoption rate of
    OT before I convert the entire library. At this point I have committed to this
    conversion and will begin the process in the coming year . . .  <BR> <BR>To that
    end however, the largest marker of OT adoption lies in Quark. It has killed me
    to wait for Quark to release an OT function aware application and frankly it has
    surprised me that Extensis never developed a plug-in that makes Quark OT function
    aware. <BR> <BR>I think it may yield stronger sales for Quark if they introduce
    full OT function awarness. Imagine how long they&#39;ve been teasing Art Directors
    with functionality they can&#39;t have! <BR> <BR>:D

    </i> <BR> <BR>Like Tiffany and Armin are hinting at, we are an obviously pro-InD
    crowd, since many of us are type designers, and all of us are type lovers. And
    with where else other than in InDesign &#40;or other Adobe products&#41; can we
    test out all of those OpenType features? <BR> <BR>But I suspect that the average
    graphic designer doesn&#39;t really even understand OpenType yet, what it is,
    how simple and unradical a change it presents to daily workflow, and what it shows
    of the future. This is something that, while marketing fonts, I think about alot.
    Education is still really important here. <BR> <BR>As type designers and producers,
    it is important to remember who our users are, and what they can do. I like OpenType&#39;s
    features, and think that they should be in more typefaces. Honestly, it is less
    important to me which programs my customers users than whether of not they use
    the fonts I am promoting. Therefore, I welcome broader OpenType support.

  body: The more typographically involved and aware people are, the more they tend
    to favour InDesign over Xpress, with few exceptions. So I suppose there may be
    large numbers of graphic designers who have only a passing interest in type as
    something one slaps on top of photos and illustrations -- certainly, there is
    enough evidence of such people --, who might not see the benefits of InDesign,
    or faults of Xpress, as clearly as we do. I&#39;m often reminded of Dean Allen&#39;s
    characterisation of Xpress -- which he used for many years -- as &#39;anti-typographic&#39;.

    much slower on InD. <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t say InDesign&#39;s big gimmicks, transparency
    and instant dropshadows, are very &#39;pro-typography&#39;. &#40;And OpenType
    doesn&#39;t deserve to be buried on a 3rd-level palette.&#41; But perhaps my definition
    of typography is a little narrow and outdated. <BR> <BR>As someone who likes to
    experiment by varying the type specs of a layout, the thing I miss most in InDesign
    is the ability, &#40;which I had in Quark&#41;, to incrementally &#34;nudge&#34;
    the leading of a multi-paragraph piece of text, where each paragraph has different
    leading. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR>I have a lot of good clients in the
    newspaper business still using Quark. Often they use a mixture of Quark on Mac
    &#40;with Type 1 fonts&#41; for the front end, and a proprietary pagination program
    on some kind of PC operating system &#40;with TrueType fonts&#41; for the back
    end. Throw in a mixture of languages, and things can get pretty hairy. This is
    exactly the kind of situation that OpenType&#39;s &#34;one font fits all&#34;
    functionality is supposed to remedy, but it&#39;s one of the slowest area of the
    business to change!

  body: I have used Quark since 1989, and stopped when InD came out. But InD and OpenType
    still have alot of ground to cover. This past summer I spoke at the Stanford Publishing
    Seminar and before my talk I asked for a show of hands regarding Quark v InD.
    95% of the audience used Quark &#40;these were mostly magazine publishers and
    editors, with a few designers scattered about&#41;. When I ased for a show of
    hands regarding OpenType, no one had ever heard of it. Now you may say that publishers
    and editors are not the target audience for OpenType and InD, but these are the
    people who more closely control a magazine&#39;s finances. And if their art directors
    are not pushing them for this stuff then it is still a way&#39;s off. <BR>On the
    plus side, I know of at least two major international magazine publishing conglomorates
    who are slowly but surely moving to InDesign. One is interested in OpenType and
    the other is making the move for InDesign&#39;s XML tagging so they can reuse
    their content across multiple venues.

    at a fraction of a pixel and with transparency layer them all up to the point
    an adobe rip won&#39;t output them.  I see atleast 1 job a week that simply will
    not even output, rip, and trap.  InDesign has gone far but is no quark killer,

    I have upgraded faithfully since that time and continue to use Quark for most
    of my print layout jobs. I have to tell you that I have never been satisfied with
    the price I have had to pay for the program, the crappy service or now the fact
    that I have two computers at home and am only able to install the program on one
    of my computers due to the licensing software limitations.  <BR> <BR>Recently,
    I have been using InDesign for layout and it&#39;s not half bad. I can tell you
    that up here where I am &#40;Ottawa, Canada&#41;, most all of the design firms
    and big companies continue to use Quark. So do our main newspapers. The basic
    reason &#40;they give me&#41; is that they have hundreds and hundreds of archived
    documents &#40;comprised of hundreds of pages&#41; that are in Quark and the conversion
    over to ID is just too painful. That&#39;s understandable. Of course, there&#39;s
    also the learning curve on InDesign &#40;which isn&#39;t that steep but still
    does require time, effort and money&#41;. We also have printers that are not as
    happy to take InDesign files - and that also deters use of the new product. <BR>
    <BR>I look at our college and the young future designers who are learning both
    programs and they really prefer InDesign. If they are the new generation of design,
    then the industry is going to have to change: There&#39;s no doubt about it. There&#39;s
    also the fact that Quark charges $1000 for its single application whereas the
    entire Adobe Creative Suite costs about the same.  <BR> <BR>Regarding &#34;features
    that can be potentially misued&#34;, one has to wonder why Quark included all
    those new tools for webdesign. I mean, does anyone ever use those tools? Now that&#39;s
    silly. As for me, I can&#39;t see myself getting the upgrade to Quark 7. I just
    don&#39;t see the benefit.'

    <BR>Andrea, <BR>If you are intending to only use one version at a time you can
    license it for both machines, for example, if one is on a laptop for external
    work. <BR>Tim

  body: I use InDesign for typesetting books and so far I have had no problems sending
    pdfs for print all over the world &#40;read USA, Canada, UK and Israel&#41;. When
    Quark starts to support the typographic features that InDesign has had in the
    past 3 or 4 versions, then Quark would have a fighting chance, but in the meantime,
    when it comes to typography, Quark is now irrelevant unless the latest versions
    now have support for full ligatures, true small caps &#40;as well as superiors,
    subscripts etc&#41;, old-style figures, symbol capitatisation, hanging punctuation,
    paragraph &#40;rather than line&#41; justification, contextual alternatives, swash
    capitals &#40;need I go on?&#41;
