  body: I don't think it's a font called "Ariel", and while it <em>might</em> be a
    very small pixelized Helvetica, it's more probably just the generic sans-serif
    on your system. And that hapens to be the last option in the CSS font list you
    provide.

  body: "Isn\u2019t this just Arial rendered binary by Standard GDI (Win XP default
    rendering)? Most Helvetica\u2019s that could potentially show up on a layman\u2019s
    Windows computer aren\u2019t hinted this carefully."

title: CSS says this is Ariel. If it is not, what is it please? I can't ID it.
