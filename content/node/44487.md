body: "We are currently revising our website, which uses Verdana for most of the body
  copy and navigation etc.  My boss thinks that using arial instead is a great idea,
  and despite my protestations that Verdana was designed for the web and screen and
  arial is a dirty Microsoft knock-off, designed only to save money, he needs some
  convincing.  Put on the spot I mumbled something about Verdana being more accessible
  and legible on screen and more efficient, but as I'm not a typographer I thought
  I'd ask for help from the real experts.\r\n\r\nCan someone help me out with some
  solid reasons that might convince a typographically illiterate person that the choice
  of font for the web IS important, and that Verdana is preferable to Arial in this
  case?\r\n\r\nOf course if people agree with him I'll shut my mouth and never give
  an opinion on typographical matters again.\r\n\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    fair, Arial isn't THAT bad on screen...in fact it's arguably better than Helvetica.
    That said, Verdana was specifically designed for the web, has a large x-height,
    and is pretty much ubiquitous and therefor, one could argue, 'friedlier' to the
    average web reader."

    in print where it can\u2019t be saved by hinting. If customers will be printing
    off big chunks of text, it would make sense to use a font with fabulous outlines

  body: Thanks for the comments, the effect when printing from the web is a big consideration
    for us, so I will certainly pass this info on.

  body: Arial imho too can be pretty good for the web. Depends all on what you want
    to achieve. Small print works better in Verdana though. Some time ago I had a
    small but really classy page designed in Arial and Arial Narrow (for intranet
    use; Arial Narrow is not available everywhere).

    you can resolve that via print CSS separate from what you see on screen."

  body: Neither Helvetica or Arial are really good for extended text. Not because
    they are sans but because of nuances of their design. Verdana holds up far better
    for that purpose. And has been mentioned, is quite screen oriented whereas Arial
    is less so. You might also consider coding your CSS for Candara which is also
    a MS font. It has been specially hinted for screen as well and is a sans like
    Araila & Verdana. Keep in mind that 11pt Verdana and 12pt Candara have similar
    apparent sizes - not 12 & 12.

  body: Is "Candara" a Vista font? I have never heard of it. If it _is_ then it cannot
    be considered a "standard" font <em>yet</em>.

    but it doesn't preclude one from spec'ing it anyways.\r\n\r\nAnyone know if MS
    has/will bundle their vista fonts with Office Mac?\r\n\r\n"
