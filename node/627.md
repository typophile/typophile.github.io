body: 'Hi! I have a question to Mac OS X users: if I clean install my computer with
  the latest version of OS X and then want to rebuild my own system of how the fonts
  are located on my hard drive, then which of the fonts installed by the System are
  safe to remove? <BR> <BR>As I understand, Lucida Grande, for example, is pretty
  essential to keep things running, but there is definitely quite an amount of fonts
  not necessary. Does anybody know, which are OK to remove and without which the System/and
  the software will not work correctly? Maybe there&#39;s a link to some handy guide
  on this issue, I didn&#39;t find any myself... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    of the language options.

  body: Thanks for the feedback. Language options definitely reduce a bunch of fonts
    installed. Creativepro story explains the whole fonts system, but does not tell
    about which ones are OK to remove. I guess it&#39;s just trial and error, then.
    Wish me luck! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    about managing fonts fro creative Professionals.  <BR> <BR>It gives more details
    about which fonts are needed and how to remove/re place certain fonts. <BR> <BR>
