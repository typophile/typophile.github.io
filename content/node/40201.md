  in Rhino 3D but i`m having problems figuring out how to make/get t-tools because
  i don`t really know what are these. wikipedia informed me only about NURBS. i need
  to get as more info about t-splines, t-junktion etc, because i understood it`s easyer
  to work with them. Help!? :)"

  body: I'm sure some people around here can tell you about some of the various splines
    used in computer graphics, but we don't often hit on 3D modeling here (sure we
    sometimes do, but that's not the main thing). You might have better luck at the
    forums on [[http://renderosity.com/|Renderosity]].
