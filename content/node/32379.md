body: "I'm currently working on a photo journal publication and wanted to seek opinions
  from other designers regarding whitespace around photographs. The publication itself
  is landscape format so as most of the photographs.\r\n\r\nIs there a generic rule
  whether should more white space be added if for instance the photo contains a main
  subject. And less white space (margins) if it is just a photo of a landscape for
  instance?"

  body: I don't know about anyone else, but I start with 1p around pix and adjust
    it depending on the content, type, etc.  You may well want more, but you sure
    don't want less.

  body: i don't know if it is a rule, but i always try to use as much white space
    as i can, and let the photo or text or logo,or anything to  breathe.

  body: I uasually put alot of space around the photo because I like to have my name
    there and title of the photo or when and where it was taken. I've started putting
    it at about 50px on each side, when the photo is roughly 700*480
