  body: This looks like an encoding problem - it seems to me that it is doing the
    conversion exactly backwards, since, for example, slot 230 is Ecircumflex on the
    Mac and ae on Windows. I have never seen Crossfont, but if it has options for
    you to specify the original encoding and the final encoding, try swapping them.
    <BR> <BR>Otherwise, if you&#39;d like a free tool, I am sure <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">FontForge</a>
    can do the job. <BR>

    to do more generic batch conversions. <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: Hmmmm. I have now tried out Transtype. But there&#39;s a new problem now...
    I have converted the fonts and gotten a whole long list of files &#40;.afm .inf
    .pfb .pfm&#41;. I can see that all these fonts are actually located on my computer.
    BUT, apparently ATM cannot. It only shows 4 out of 20.  <BR> <BR>Argh!

  body: Magnus <BR> <BR>Well, should you not be getting &#34;a whole long list of
    file&#34;? Those four as opposed to the normal two with a Mac &#40;plus the optional
    AFM&#41;? <BR> <BR>You do have to be a bit careful with batch conversion, especially
    if you are converting from format to format rather than just platform to platform.
    Font &#34;families&#34; are treated a bit differently in the differing formats/platforms
    and can get botched if generated within the orginal folder. PC fonts have a number
    restriction &#40;as I recall, four&#41;. I usually generate from PCTT to Mac PS1
    and I will generally configure PCTT multiple fonts separately, rather than run
    them in batch mode, because of this problem. Doubt this makes much sense. <BR>
    <BR>If you have the software program Font Doctor, that can often help you resolve
    conflicts. <BR> <BR>Gerald

    to me. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
    BORDER=0> A little maybe. <BR> <BR>Should I convert each weight separately? <BR>I
    don&#39;t know. But I have found that if I put the all the files into the windows/fonts
    folder instead of using ATM, it actually works. ?!?!?!?! Crazy. If it was just
    one fontfamily that did this I guess I could live with it but I see it happening
    to others as well. It&#39;s a real drag with that windows/font folder. It very
    easily becomes a huge mess of font files.  <BR> <BR>BTW:  <BR>Gerald&#62;&#62;&#62;
    &#34;Well, should you not be getting &#34;a whole long list of file&#34;? Those

    <BR> <BR>Yes I know. For instance: I have 1 font I convert it, I get 4 files.
    Yup that&#39;s right. <BR> <BR>The font I&#39;m trying to convert is Berthold
    Akzidenz Grotesk and as you probably know it has a lot of weights. And that&#39;s
    4 files for each weight in windows. The problem is that ATM doesn&#39;t &#34;recognize&#34;
    all of these files as being fonts or pehaps more likely it assumes that a lot
    of them are the same. Because it only shows four weights. This has been bugging
    me for quite some time now. Frustrating. <BR> <BR>I will try and see what this
    Font Doctor is about  if I can get my hands on a demo or something. <BR> <BR>thanks

  body: Magnus <BR> <BR>A bit clearer to me now. Yes, you are correct regarding the
    weights. A problem is that the name of either the printer font or screen font
    could be replicated in the conversion process and hence deleted. Or it is assigning
    the same name. I think you are only allowed the regular, italic, bold, bold italic
    unless you create separate fonts/folders.  <BR> <BR>If you are trying to generate
    the various weights you many need to rename the primary font, or some of the weights,
    to avoid this. Or this could be a FOND ID problem. One of the great things about
    FontDoctor &#40;maybe the only really great thing&#41; is that it will change
    the ID for you and assign unique numbers. Your system may be recognizing a duplicated
    ID number, and consequently ignoring the second or third instance of it. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m not a PC guy &#40;well, not since about 1990&#41; so I&#39;m just
    making some assumptions here. <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: Ahhh.  <BR>Thanks, I think you are right. Seeing things this way makes it
    all a little bit less peculiar. I will try to put the different weights into different
    folders and see what happens. And maybe take a look at fontdoctor. <BR> <BR>Thank
    you very much. <BR> <BR>magnus
