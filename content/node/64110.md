  body: "Well, you're absolutely right. As a matter of fact, that \"O\" is very narrow,
    especially compared to the \"C\" it is supposed to counterbalance. That's a trait
    of the typeface itself that the logo's designer didn't bothered to compensate.
    In fact, had they used an actual \"0\", it would have appeared slightly better.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, what's wrong with terminal 0s? ;-) "
