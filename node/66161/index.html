my own observation is that uncreative people (in the sense people mean it when the say "creative" :o) is that they are afraid to make mistakes, or make fools of them selves—And that skill & virtuosity are often confused for creativity.

		<div class="commentbody">Let me propose, by way of a thought experiment, that creativity is a construct, a label for a presumed enabling property of beings that create, a property whose existence is presumed from observation of created things or the process of creating them. So what would the practical difference be between teaching creativity -- by which I would understand deliberately encouraging, fostering and developing this presumed enabling property -- and teaching creation -- by which I would mean teaching the making of things? Put it another way: how could you tell whether you had successfully taught creativity other than by observation of things created? I've met many people over the years who claim to be creative -- by which they mean that they have an idea of themselves, which they like, as creative people -- but who don't actually make anything. I think they're full of... but that's because the proof of the pudding is, if not in the eating, at very least in its tangible existence.</div>

To be serious, though, there are two parts to creativity: the ability to create, and the joy of creating. I'm not sure, but I think that the joy is the critical ingredient. I'm not sure how to teach that, but I imagine it could be inspired.</div>

If someone wants to call stuff made by others "creative" or some mystical process people go through to make stuff, that even sounds a bit over the top to me. I am just as happy with "making stuff" and hope a few people are happy with the stuff.

Creativity or the ability to let go and be open to multiple directions and new mental wanderings CAN be taught.

It's all there for the taking.

The simplest tangible road maps lie in the imagery progression of Pablo Picasso, and the word play and story telling of Bob Dylan's catalog. You don't have to like either. Just understand it.

The blue-print was established a long time ago. It's just that Joe Average believes there is a road-block to creativity somewhere out there on the horizon. 

There is no traffic on the creativity highway.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Creativity can be taught, I believe in this because I don't consider myself a creative person. I have methods to make my designs be creative and original. 

When I met graphic designer Lorenzo Shakespear from the [[http://www.webshakespear.com.ar/|Estudio Shakespear]] he said that I shouldn't read too many graphic design books. Instead he encouraged me to keep reading literature, magazines, listening to good music, travelling, meeting people, etc. All these things conform our cultural packbag, and as we keep learning things, this packbag will get bigger. 

The cultural packbag is a tool that helps to provide a solution of a problem without having too many input information about it. 

Another tool that we can add is our "eye training". Watching and studing good design will help us have a more accurate selfcriticism about what we do. 

This tools make us see things in a different way, in a creative way, because sometimes (I don't know who said this) creativity is not only to create something that nobody has ever seen, but also, to think what nobody ever thought about something that everybody sees.

		<div class="commentbody">We humans are routinely creative, for example in creating new sentences, never written or said before. So talking about creativity can sound rather pretentious.  

But I do think that there is something real when people talk about teaching creativity. I think they are referring to finding innovative and good solutions to problems. The problem can be of any sort: it may have to do with how to paint trees or prove a mathematical theorem or run a successful political campaign. But in all cases it refers to a difficult problem, and finding innovative solutions. 

Things that are involved are imagination, focus, discipline, and the ability to get into that state now called "flow". I think the nature of this kind of creativity, and whether you can foster it, are really interesting questions. I don't know the answers.

edit: Ok so I lied. I do know a small part of the answer, as I wrote a book about it: [[http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Error-Karl-Poppers-Psychology/dp/0912050748/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1263410545&sr=8-7|Learning from Error: Karl Popper's Psychology of Learning]] (also in [[http://www.amazon.de/Bedeutung-Lerntheorie-Psychologie-Philosophie-Wissenschaft/dp/B0020I1UI6/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1263410680&sr=8-5|German edition]].  This is really about creative problem-solving. One aspect of really innovative work is that you don't take past ideas as a given, but are willing to look critically at where the old ideas don't work. Then you try to find solutions that work better for those places the old ideas didn't work so well. Einstein had this kind of attitude--in spades, as they say.   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">So far, we have the following proposed definitions of creativity (with the caveat that the people who put forward these definitions may not be committed to them):

Darrel: <em>the ability to create</em>

Me: <em>a presumed enabling property of beings that create</em>

Jack: <em>the ability to let go and be open to multiple directions and new mental wanderings</em> [cf: Russell's suggestion that ‘uncreative’ people are ‘afraid to make mistakes, or make fools of them selves’]

Christopher: <em>a neurophysiological process in which the brain forms new associative neural pathways</em>

***

It seems to me that we either need to distinguish mental creativity or ‘creative thinking’ from creative acts, i.e. making things (as Chris put it with admirable clarity), or find a way to unify the mental and physical phenomena.

I don't find the romantic view of mental creativity helpful, since it relies entirely on metaphors (openness, wandering, road maps, blue-prints, highway); it may be an <em>example</em> of creative thinking -- and perhaps even evidence that creativity is not something that can be nailed down analytically --, but it is also a demonstration that metaphors tend to lead only to more metaphors.

Chrisopher's proposed definition seems unromantic, but it strikes me as begging the question to apply the label ‘creativity’ to the formation of new associative neural pathways, since the formation of such pathways does not necessarily correspond to what we commonly understand by creativity as e.g. observable in the making of things. If a definition requires abandoning common usage in favour of a novel scientific application, we have to acknowledge that we are no longer talking about the same things. Both common and specialised usage of terms may have their place, but one can't be taken to trump the other.

This leaves us with the notion of ability or enabling property, another word for which is talent. As I said above, I think such a property is presumed on the basis of observation: we see people creating things or we see the things that people have created, and we presume a property in the people that enables them to create things, and we label this property ‘creativity’. Like most enabling properties, it has to be innate at some level; even virtuoso performances requiring highly developed enabling properties rely on innate properties that in enable such development. So I don't think creativity could be taught, as it were, from scratch, as a purely cultural transmission without a pre-existing natural transmission of an innate creative property. It follows then, that if the phrase ‘teaching creativity’ has any sensible meaning, then it must imply fostering or developing of that innate property.

It may also imply, in many situations, simply getting the hell out of the way.</div>

I think I disagree with Popper on this, or at least I think one needs to over-generalise the notion of ‘problem solving’ in order to rope in all creative activity. Most obviously, I don't think art can be explained in terms of problem solving, because, really, what's the problem that a painting solves? There are material problems in the making of things, and compositional problems, and these may benefit from -- but do not necessarily require -- creative solutions, but neither these problems nor their solutions constitute art.

I also don't accept the notion of design as problem solving; or, rather, I accept that only as one working approach to design, and not always the best one. Most often, it is an educational approach, i.e. a way to teach design, which produces designers who use this approach. But every once in a while one meets designers who, either because they were trained in a different way or because they have consciously rejected the problem-solving approach, do things differently. Peter Bil'ak, for example, considers reading, rather than problem solving, to be the paradigm of design. I find this an especially interesting idea, because it allows the possibility that even those designers who imagine themselves to be problem solving might actually be reading. :)</div>

Popper has an essay called [[http://www.amazon.com/Life-Problem-Solving-Karl-Popper/dp/0415249929/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1263414930&sr=8-8|All life is problem solving]], so obviously he would have disagreed with you about whether art and design are problem-solving. 

Art is problem-solving, but is unusual in that it includes self-expression as a primary goal, which design doesn't usually.

In [[http://vimeo.com/7252845|this lovely talk]], Michael Bierut eloquently argues that design is a kind of problem-solving, and in a way that I think is totally convincing. It certainly corresponds to my experience in design. 

Maybe we mean something different by problem-solving. 

As I said, what people are usually interested in when they talk about creativity is the process that leads to that special class of solutions: innovative and excellent solutions to difficult problems.

		<div class="commentbody">Panda, language solves communication problems. Design solves problems created by design, i.e. by failure to use language. :)

But accepting, for the sake of argument, your claim that design does solve problems, that doesn't imply that problem solving is either the primary function of design or the singular approach to be taken to design. It just happens to be an approach that has proven itself saleable. It sounds better to walk into a client's offices and say ‘I'm here to solve your problems’ than it does to say ‘I'm your new esthetician’. Of course, Popper would say that an esthetician is problem solving when she's buffing your nails, but that's what I mean when I say that Popper over-generalised the notion of problem solving to the point where it means everything -- ‘all life’ in his own words -- and hence means nothing very useful. I don't doubt that a case can be made that manicures solve problems, but that doesn't mean that problem solving is the essential nature of what a manicurist does and I don't believe it is the essential nature of design. It is possible to practice design -- and probably manicures -- in a way that puts a focus on problem solving processes, and many people do this very successfully and many teachers in design schools encourage or enforce this approach (and is <em>that</em> ‘teaching creativity’?). My point is that it is not a focus or an approach that is essential to the nature of design, that other approaches and foci are possible, and that they may, in fact, be more creative.

Bill: <em>Art is problem-solving...</em>

What's the problem?

<em>...but is unusual in that it includes self-expression as a primary goal...</em>

I do not believe that is a primary goal of art. Self-expression is a post-romantic approach to art, and as such is inapplicable, except anachronistically and anaculturally, to most of the art that our species has produced.

In a recent essay, Robert Bringhurst made a comment something to the effect that art that expresses only your self isn't trying very hard. Quite.

<em>As I said, what people are usually interested in when they talk about creativity is the process that leads to that special class of solutions: innovative and excellent solutions to difficult problems.</em>

This is a good observation. It inspires me to be a splitter: I think creative problem solving -- this thing that ‘people are usually interested in when they talk about creativity’ -- needs to be distinguished from creative making, because I don't think the latter can be subsumed in toto under ‘problem solving’. I can't think that, because I'm sitting here surrounded by too many created things that are not examples of problem solving.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In Popper's terms, problems are difficulties achieving a goal. The goal orientation of human behavior, and the constant effort to overcome difficulties to achieve goals I think is very accurate. I don't think it's generality means that it's not a useful concept. On the contrary, looking at goals and difficulties is an extremely useful tool for analysis of many activities. 

Please don't saddle Popper with the idea of art as self-expression, as he rejected it. He ridiculed it by saying that sneezing is also self expression. 

I think there's an element of truth in the idea that art is partly self expression, but I was referring to that theory mainly to include the personal and emotional element in art. 

I haven't read much in aesthetics, and only know What is Art by R.G. Collingwood--a pretty interesting book, at least in the first half. I don't know a general definition of the goal of art, but if you go to something specific, like a sculptor, and ask the sculptor about his work, you will get a problem-solving story not unlike that of a scientist. He or she was try to get a certain effect, or something new, and thought about other sculptures, the materials, probably the emotion, and started working. One of the things Collingwood claims is that a feature of artistic work is that you discover the goal explicitly as you go along. You start out with a general idea, but discover the goal and form in interaction with the work you make, be it a sculpture or a play. 

But the point is that as you go along--and Popper would agree with this part--you are constantly critiquing whether you have got something you like, and how it needs to be developed or changed. That is problem solving. 

The framework of problem-solving doesn't answer very many questions in itself, but if you don't start there as a framework, you get everything else wrong, in my opinion. 

In the design process, people in type usually talk about the 'brief' they have, and how they went through a process of trial and error--goal oriented problem-solving to solve it. The [[http://typoberlin.de/video/index.php?node_id=9&lang_id=1&scope=front&ds_target_id=819|recently posted video of Christian Schwartz]] talking about his developing Georgio for the New York Times goes clearly goes through a whole problem-solving process, in discussion with the art director.  </div>

As I wrote above, there are lots of kinds of problem solving <em>within</em> the creating of something, but that doesn't imply that problem solving is the essence or even the purpose of creating something and, hence, creativity equals problem solving ability or process. If Popper is right, then I doubt if problem solving can be considered the essence of anything except insofar as it is a common essence of all activities of goal oriented life. If we want to talk usefully about the essential nature of particular activities, then we need to talk about what is particularly essential to them, what differentiates them. Certainly, it is unhelpful to say that ‘design is problem solving’, if problem solving is a general essence of all activities. ‘Manicure is problem solving.’ There is a sense in which the claim is true, but it isn't a useful sense, especially not if everything else is also problem solving.

There is also the problem, er, issue of utility. If creativity is problem solving to overcome difficulties in achieving a goal, then the products of creativity are utile and must favour ease and efficiency. But many of the products of creative acts are not utile or are strongly characterised by their extra-utile aspects or components (their art, rather than their craft). I believe this is because creativity is only sometimes and only partly concerned with problem solving, and when it is concerned with art it is no less creative than when concerned with craft. You don't need to be solving problems in order to be creative.

To me, the equation of creativity with problem solving ability looks like either a cultural or profressional specialised usage. We have a culture that favours problem solving approaches to deliberately goal oriented activities, and hence that favours, financially, problem solving approaches to things like design, and we have a specialised application of design skills in the resulting market that favours a problem solving approach. That's fine: there's nothing wrong with either cultural-specific or specialised usages of words, so long as one recognises the limits of these uses. As you wrote, Bill, this is ‘what people are usually interested in when they talk about creativity’ or, at least, what they are interested in in this culture and in the design profession. I note that education reformers such as Ken Robinson present their ideas about creativity explicitly in the context of this cultural framework and its current structural and technological phase, pointing to the value of fostering creativity in contributing to economic vitality.

I'm interested in a more general usage, in which creativity is linked in some way to creating, to making things. Creating may involve innovative, original ideas that solve problems, but it doesn't have to. That's a subclass of creating, resulting in a subclass of created things. I'm interested in a notion of creativity that applies in some way to all creative acts, including those that are non-innovative, unoriginal and don't solve problems.

<a href="http://www.zakariya.net/gallery/gallery/after-yesari.jpg">Here's an example.</a> It isn't innovative, it is traditional. It isn't original, it is after a piece by another master calligrapher. It doesn't solve any problem or, at least, it doesn't solve any problem that hasn't already been solved hundreds of times, often in easier and more efficient ways.

I think there are two responses to a piece like this. One must either say that creativity involves more than innovative, original problem solving, or one must say that this is an uncreative piece, that it doesn't exhibit creativity, that although it is a created thing it does not render to observation evidence of creativity. I think either perspective is valid, and if you want to stick with your definition of creativity and deny that this piece exhibits creativity, that's fine. What I don't think would be right would be to try to pervert the nature of a piece like this to make it fit a definition of creativity that it cannot meet.

Ultimately -- and most often primarily too! --, what interests me is the thing made, not the ideas or processes behind it. This is why I suggested that creativity is a <em>presumed</em> enabling property that we only know through observation of created things. Frankly, I can do without the concept so long as people keep making things.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I agree with Popper that talking about essences (as did Aristotle) is generally a way to run a discussion into futility, so I won't go there. 

I didn't say creativity was problem-solving, I said it was an aspect of problem-solving. And the creativity that people are interested in is the outstanding kind--difficult and important problems, innovative solutions. But the process is no doubt rooted in skills we use routinely--problem-solving skills. The question is what lifts those to a higher level. And answers include imagination, focus, discipline, passion etc.   

But I am starting to suspect we are at cross purposes here because we mean different things by 'problem'. You seem to be restricting problems to practical problems, and that's not at all what I mean, or the concept that Popper had in mind. Technological problems are at their root practical problems, but scientific problems are problems of understanding, intellectual problems. A physicist wants to understand matter and motion, a sociologist wants to understand society etc. 

And artistic problems are at their root not practical, but something else, having to do with expression and communication, but hard to define exactly.

In my experience, artistic problems are almost always problems of form and how to get form. Sure such problems emerge in the process of making something that may transcend form, but form is the level at which the problems resolve, present themselves and need to be dealt with. It is not that I am limiting problems to practical problems, but that I am distinguishing problems within the making of a thing from the thing itself, and saying that the latter is the evidence that we have of creativity, if such a thing exists, whether we are aware or not of the problems involved in its making. Sometimes, this distinction is explicit in the purpose of making: do I make a thing <em>in order</em> to solve the problems that emerge during its making? or do I make a thing for purposes that are independent of that process? If the latter, are those purpose not creative?

		<div class="commentbody">To me, creativity is something innately human that exists to some degree in all of us. But, by its nature, is not easily defined or fostered. 
To me, creativity is not a product of investigational process but something that comes without being consciously provoked from within OR without. It is the whimsical ignorance of logic that occurs in spite of all of our attempts to make it logical. It is on one hand, the "Eureka Effect" that logic can be applied to later as proof of concept but not spelled out while arriving at a "solution".
Creativity can be arrived at without seeking a solution or even having a problem to solve. Sometimes people do things or make things in an impromptu manner and the application (if there is one) comes later. Art is not created as a solution to a problem, it is just something the human does and others give it value. That is not to say that problems cannot be solved creatively--it merely means it is not required to either solve or not solve a problem. Even if not intended, the problem/solution part can be applied after the fact. Someone invents the wheel and later someone else uses it to propel a vehicle.

		<div class="commentbody">John, I agree with you that the purpose of a creative act is not simply to create, but to get a result, whether that be a painting, poem, scientific theory or new computer. But I believe that when people talk about creativity, and study it, they refer to the process involved in getting an innovative and excellent product, whatever the goal. 

The qualities of the result is how we judge whether something is 'creative', but what the literature on creativity focuses on, I believe, is the process to do that, which is a problem-solving process.

Chris, I do think that creative effort is purposive, and how one struggles to achieve the purpose is a problem-solving process, even though it's not a problem in the sense of something that worries or troubles you. It may be pursued purely for joy, but still fall under 'problem-solving' in this general sense. 

The reason I think that framework is helpful, is that then you can see what fosters creativity.

By the way, in the case of Archimedes, when he cried 'Eureka', "I found it", it was because he was looking for something, the solution to a problem.

I think this is a fair assessment, but my concern is that such literature -- and notions of teaching or fostering creativity derived from that literature -- talks about creativity in terms of process and problem solving <em>because that's the only way its found in which to say definite things about creativity.</em> My belief is that this approach to creativity is too narrow, and at least the literature should acknowledge that it is limiting its discussion to what is easily describable rather than suggesting, as it seems to, that creativity = problem solving. It seems to me at least possible that it would be more sensible to say that creativity is <em>applied to</em> problem solving, as evidenced by the fact that problems also get solved in non-creative ways and by the fact that evidence of creativity can be found in works that do not exist to solve problems.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Can creativity be taught?

No, I don't think it can be taught.

To me creativity is the ability to bring out a meaning. And even better, a coherent meaning, and even better than that, a coherent and fresh meaning. 

So, when I think of creativity I think of guys like Mozart, Van Gogh, Rodin, and to a lesser extent a huge bunch of 'others' including Picasso, Hokusai, Thoreau, even Miles Davis. And then, to an even lesser extent, others such as F.L.Wright, Glaser, Rand, D. Thomas...
 
But to say that if one combines A with B and gets AB (as seen in a lot of today's logos) this is not creativity - it is a formulated approach to communication. Problem solving as a means to communicate - a base yet meaningful process / skill.

Very few people in graphic design are creative. But, there a heck of a lot of sound problem solvers.

Problem solving on the other hand can be taught.

		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I've found the idea that much thinking is problem-solving the single most useful idea I learned from Popper. 

For example, if you are trying to understand any field--electromagnetic theory, sculpture, statecraft, type design--if you ask: What are the main problems? What are the alternative solutions? What are the arguments pro and con the different approaches? What were past problems and solutions that led to the current situation? You get the lay of the land more quickly than any other way. 

The idea of problem-solving being a key to understanding cognition arose in the 19th century after Darwin, with C.S. Peirce in the US and Ostwald Kuelpe in Germany. The idea was that purpose and trial and error are very important to the way we operate. "Error" means you have some standards about what kinds of thing will serve your purpose or not. I've avoided using the word "problem-solving", but that's what it is: trial and error to achieve a goal, with some mental criteria of what counts as good and bad solutions. 

Routine or very innovative thinking both has these. The question is whether the very innovative and good kind has something more or special, and what it is.

John, Chris, if you can get a better theory of creativity without the problem-solving framework, more power to you. I'd be delighted to see it.

It and Edward de Bono's contemporary [[http://www.amazon.com/Lateral-Thinking-Creativity-Perennial-Library/dp/0060903252/|Lateral Thinking]] are fun reads and pragmatically useful in my experience.

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I have no difficulty accepting the role of problem solving in understanding cognition, but we're talking about creativity, not about understanding cognition. It is the jump that you make from the problem-solving framework that provides a means of describing some aspects of some creative acts to creativity itself that I find wholly unconvincing.

Some of the contributors to this discussion have spoken of creativity is explicitly judicial ways, i.e. labelling different processes or made things as creative or uncreative, or perhaps more or less creative. This is a legitimate approach, I think, -- albeit one that I don't share -- and one that I think can be consistent with your understanding of creativity as problem solving (obviously not all problem solving, though; we seem to agree that problem solving can also be uncreative or, as you put it, routine). Of course, ‘5star’ is being judicial but cutting the cake in a different way, making a distinction between creativity and problem solving that I think we both disagree with.

<em>...if you can get a better theory of creativity without the problem-solving framework, more power to you. I'd be delighted to see it.</em>

As I said in my first post this discussion, I believe creativity is a presumed enabling property of beings that create. As such, I think creativity <em>is a theory</em> -- or, at any rate, a construct --, so what you appear to me to be asking for is a theory about the theory. I say creativity is a <em>presumed</em> property, because I am not convinced that it exists, other than as a mental construct that we use to talk about how, and perhaps why, beings that create do so.

I was watching a lecture by an animal behaviourist last year, in which she was talking about dog training and the now largely discounted idea of ‘dominance’. As she pointed out, dominance was a construct applied to explain a whole set of behaviours, and people who bought into the construct -- who forgot that it was a construct and believed it was a real phenomenon -- ceased describing actual animal behaviours, the things that animals were actually doing, and instead started talking in terms of ‘dominance behaviour’.

To me, creativity looks like a construct to explain things that humans do just like dominance was a construct to explain things that dogs do. I'd rather look at the things people do and make, and try to describe those things individually and understand their particular characteristics and effects, rather than lumping them all together under this umbrella of creativity that we then need to further reduce to a notion of problem solving just to make any sense of.</div>

In other words, you want me to define it as you do using a definition which is neither exclusive of or required to define creativity. Or perhaps you are saying that your failed definition is better than any failed definition I might come up with. I would rather leave it as an undetermined construct. :-)

Well, I think if you want to understand and promote creativity, getting testable theories of it would be great. And to do that you have to go beyond looking only at individual cases, and imaginatively hypothesize what might be common to the individual cases. In saying that creativity is a kind of problem-solving I don't think I'm 'reducing' creativity. Neither I or those who study creativity seriously are saying that there isn't something special about that variety of problem-solving, a something special that they devote their lives to trying to understand. 

Chris, I wasn't defining creativity, so I don't have a successful or failed definition, I have no definition. 

I was reporting the theory that creativity is a species or kind of problem-solving--which is I believe the most widespread view by those who are studying this issue. I don't think theories of the creative process have gotten very far, but the idea of them as a kind of problem-solving seems to me an interesting start. 

John, Chris, are you opposed to *any* scientific theories of creativity, or just the idea that creativity is a species of problem-solving?

I don't have my own theory of creativity, but I do have an idea about the original question, "Can creativity be taught?"

Most people go into a field, whether it be type design or biology, because their individual nature and life experience has led them to have particular goals, questions, and perspective in that area. Since each person's mental biography is different, this is something unique to the individual, and it is also something that fuels passion to achieve goals and solve problems in the field, whether it be art or design or science or business or whatever. 

A lot of times the pressures of education can make a person leave behind those original questions and perspective, coming out of his or her life experience, and with it goes the passion. And that passion and unique questions and perspective I think are key things that fuel outstanding creative work. 

Einstein I think had something like this in mind when he said that "genius is a tender plant."

So I do think you can teach in a way that fosters creativity, or squelches it. What fosters it are projects that allow the student to follow his or her interests. This doesn't mean that teachers should be uncritical, but they should respect and foster that individuality as a source of strength. So to foster creativity: 1. do student-initiated projects. 2. always respect and encourage the individual point of view, when critiquing. </div>

Because women A has blue eyes and is considered to be beautiful does not mean that women B, who has brown eyes, cannot also be beautiful.
Science, by its nature, excludes variables in an attempt to focus data change on the single variable in question. The variables in Creativity are perhaps many and perhaps mostly unknown. That makes it tough to prove or disprove any theory. Perhaps not impossible but just not apparent to my aging eyes.

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I think if you read back through this entire thread you get a pretty good view of what I am talking about: various people have defined creativity or presented examples of what they consider creativity, and the diversity of views really suggests to me that, at best, creativity is a portmanteau term freely used to label a wide range of phenomena. This is why I am inclined to view creativity as a construct and not as a phenomenon. I made a parallel with the construct of dominance in animal behaviourism, and pointed to the problems that arise from treating constructs as if they are phenomena: the classic Platonic problem of treating ideas as if they were things. I might say that there is no such thing as creativity, only a variety of creative acts.

<em>I was reporting the theory that creativity is a species or kind of problem-solving--which is I believe the most widespread view by those who are studying this issue.</em>

See, it seems to me that what such theorists are actually studying creativity <em>as applied to problem solving,</em> and then mistakenly identifying creativity with problem solving. The falsity of this identification is made obvious simply by considering non-creative problem solving. If problem solving can be either creative or uncreative, then it is obvious that problem solving is something to which creativity is applied or not applied as the case may be. Problem solving, hence, may provide a convenient framework within which to explore creative processes, but it can't be considered the only framework within which such processes apply. Most seriously, the problem solving paradigm, while it explains many things that happen <em>within</em> the making of a thing, cannot always explain the making of a thing. A painter solves many problems in the making of a painting, but what is the problem that is solved by the making of the painting?</div>

You're not saying that a scientific theory is no good if it fails to explain everything, are you? Because then all science would have to be thrown out, because no scientific theory explains everything, and I don't think ever will. Understanding a little bit better is better than understanding nothing, in my book. If a theoretician would say "everything I don't explain doesn't exist", that would be block headed. But I don't think the literature on this ever is so presumptuous. 

Maybe I'm overacting and misinterpreting, but it sounded like to me that you and John are being too cavalier in rejecting the life work of people who have tried to understand creativity better. 
  
>I don't think creativity is the same as innovation or that it requires a practical application to qualify. 

Chris, I clearly said above that problems don't have to be practical. Artistic and scientific problems are not in themselves practical, though their solutions may end up being useful.  

I think maybe a cause of mis-communication here is that the term 'problem' as used by Popper and I think many others is more general than the common use of the term.  </div>

The problem is in understanding a little -- or even a lot -- and thinking that you are understanding everything.

<em>Maybe I'm overacting and misinterpreting, but it sounded like to me that you and John are being too cavalier in rejecting the life work of people who have tried to understand creativity better.</em>

I'm not rejecting that work, I'm pointing out a) that it might be proceeding from a mistaken foundation (treating a construct as a phenomenon) and b) that it is limiting its focus to a subclass of the application of creative processes and treating that subclass as paradigmatic; I am questioning whether that subclass is actually paradigmatic of all creative acts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">>what is the problem that is solved by the making of the painting?

The problem depends on the painting. Extended efforts, as opposed to a reflex or unconscious habit, always have some kind of goal. 

Some paintings I sure have just been to make money, and the painter was thinking: what kind of picture would fetch a good price? Others may have had a goal like, "How can I share with others the uplifting vision of this sunset I'm looking at?"  Or "How can I capture the charm and cruelty I see in the face of the person I'm doing a portrait of?"

The point is, as the painter works he or she does have an idea of what they want, and what is better and worse. I'm not saying that it's always a clear idea. As Collingwood argued, in artistic creation the goal often evolves in the process. The painter might say: there was something in that scene that spoke to me, and I wanted to capture it." But that is still a goal, and the trial and error--sketching, or repainting--is a problem solving process, I think.

Part of the problem here in communicating is that 'creativity' is a very vague term, but like terms that arise naturally, I think do it describes real things, even if it is not a very precise concept. Looking at Nancy Nersessian's book, she refers to an author who distinguishes between 'personal creativity' and 'historical creativity'. The first creates something new for that individual person, the second creates something new in the context of history. 

I think a lot of the fascination with this issue is the question of how these great innovations are created, and whether the process has something distinctive in it. Nancy's view is that the ordinary, routine creativity is on a continuum with the outstanding, historical kind. That is, some of the same problem-solving processes are involved, though there is also most than that involved.     

What is the aspect of creativity that you think the problem-solving approach excludes?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris said that Vincent was just makin' stuff, but I think reading [[http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/|Van Gogh's letters]] may lend support to Bill's idea about art as striving towards goals. In fact it seems to me that one can't talk about "process" without talking about "goals." (My dictionary defines process as "a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end.") So we need to distinguish reaching towards goals from solving problems if we still want to have something to say about the creative process outside of problem solving.

It might help to have some more examples so that we are clear on what counts as a "problem" for each of us. Is "what can I make with this lump of clay that appeals to my sense of beauty?" a problem? </div>

Leave your academics aside for the moment and go back to primitive peoples who depicted their environs on the cave walls. Or, go to the natives peoples in the Americas who depicted subject matters on their animal skin garments, in bead work, etc.. 

This people had the natural ability to interpret.

Just as mentioned: "Einstein I think had something like this in mind when he said that "genius is a tender plant."  
Yes, Einstein was correct, Genius is a natural state - part of nature - and needs nurturing. Those wonderful souls that I mentioned earlier all had the natural ability - in various degrees - to interpret to give meaning. 

The next question is - what is a master piece. What differentiates a F.L.Wright from a Van Gogh. Or, within the same discipline, what differentiates a Matisse from a Van Gogh - in terms of creative ability to be able to impart a coherent meaning. Bet your life, there are distinct levels of natural ability - with genius being the wonderful plant on the planet.

I think a good study would be to have a number of test subjects interpret, in a meaningful way, the same subject matter. From there one can asses creative ability. And those test subject can come from any walk of life.

For instance, you and me and another eight test subjects sat to interpret a starry sky...

Or, perhaps give our interpretation of a great leader. Or, perhaps give our interpretation for a new logo. No, sorry, creativity cannot be taught. It is as natural as the day is long.

A new reality TV show ...coming soon. Go out and at random pick ten people...

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, Craig, the way I think about it is that goal striving is a pre-requisite to problem solving. 

If you can achieve your goal immediately, with no trial and error and no reflection, then I wouldn't call it problem-solving. But if you have some obstacles to overcome, or an ideal you don't immediately seem to reach, then it's problem-solving. Problem-solving involves some kind of guided imagination and effort. You are imagining and doing things that are not automatically satisfactory; you have some idea whether they are closer to or farther from the goal.  

Thanks Craig for bringing in your knowledge of history of art. I don't know this history, but my impression is, as you say, that when you get into the details of what an artist was up to, in his or her own words, it looks a lot like creative effort in science--imaginative problem-solving.

By the way the "Eureka!" example that Chris brought up shows the common misunderstanding of the thought process involved in discovery. He didn't just get in the bathtub and accidentally come up with a solution. He had made more progress in understanding how to calculate volumes than anybody in history, and when he was given the problem of finding the density of the crown in relation to pure gold, he exercised his imagination guided by his past knowledge. He was looking everywhere, and the bathtub added one key element to his problem-situation that gave him the idea. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#The_Golden_Crown|Here is a reconstruction of the story]], as explained by Galileo, who wasn't too shabby a creative thinker either. </div>

Fine artists are no different. Those pieces you're experiencing around you might not seem like a problem/solution scenario to you but for the artist it was an attempt at an answer. Those who are realistic know there isn't a solution, just hope. But the problem remains…

As a poet, I can tell you that while initial writing is unconscious, the problem is distillation. It must be the same when your drawing glyphs on a pad and then want to make it into a font.

Do you really think Van Gogh painted without thinking? Or even Jackson Pollock? Do you think the person who did the Arabic calligraphy you posted didn't think about how to honor the piece he was recreating? Is that a problem? It was until he solved it. His problem was probably how to get into the spiritual space he imagined necessary.

Is the process a problem? No, it's a blessing. Results are feeble by comparison, as a matter of fact, they're the problem. The process is the solution.

It was said of Mozart that he could compose effortlessly in his head and that writing down the notes was merely a task. There is an oft-repeated anecdote that his Trio in E flat, K.498 — known as the “Kegelstatt” trio — was composed one afternoon while playing skittles (bowling) with friends.

I'm sure that effortlessness wasn’t true of every composition, and I can’t say that there wasn’t reflection (depending upon how specificly you want to define this). 

But, are you saying that without trial and error, and without reflection, there is no problem-solving, and thus no creativity? That seems like an awfully Romantic notion.</div>

As I said, by 'problem' in this context is not meant a bad thing. Popper thought that since "all life is problem-solving" being able to choose your problems, such as doing a painting or a typeface or a poem or a scientific question, is a great blessing. 

>But, are you saying that without trial and error, and without reflection, there is no problem-solving, and thus no creativity? That seems like an awfully Romantic notion.

Much of problem-solving is unconscious, but it does take time. Mozart I would be was thinking about that trio, even before it was written down. I don't know if it's romantic or not, but I think that's what happens: there's a goal, there's time working on it, there's a solution. If there's no need for a mental search process I wouldn't call it creative problem-solving. If there's a goal and you have a read-made solution, I guess it's problem solving in some sense, but not creative.

So, reflection is prerequisite, but not necessarily trial-and-error?

Yes, it’s safe to assume Mozart thought about the Kegelstatt trio. It came to him. He imagined it. He wrote it down. Problem solved.

I need to go have breakfast now. I’m thinking about it. I imagine what I’d like to have. When I’m done with this post, I’ll go eat. Problem solved.

You said creativity is an aspect of problem-solving. What distinguishes the creative problem-solving from the routine problem-solving?

I have to say, I’m not sure if creativity is an aspect of problem-solving <em>per se</em> or if, as John suggests, problem-solving is an aspect of creativity.

As a child (starting at 8yrs) I attended a Talmud Torah (Bible Studies, Orthodox, Jewish) and had a teacher who did something no other teacher I have ever had has done before or since.
He gave praise and extra credit for asking good questions. "Good" meaning probing, non-obvious, explorative. He really made a big deal out of it and said that asking good questions was the key to knowledge.
(I would add, also, the courage to accept the answers when the facts bear them out is key, as well. The human capacity for self-deception is astounding.)

Wherever I see creative achievement, I see a creator who has, at the very least, asked the right and relevant questions.
Mr. Jacobowitz was on to something. And whenever I've been called on to teach, I've tried to foster as much question-asking as possible. It can be sloppy, it can be disruptive, but it's better overall.

Just a personal take on the topic...

		<div class="commentbody">I don't want to get bogged down in definitions, as 'creativity' and 'problem-solving' are both vague enough terms to argue endlessly without getting anywhere. 

We make our ideas clear, as C.S. Peirce said in a great essay, when we relate them to something concrete, to action. In this case what is clear is the problem that thinkers have been working on for over a century now: what is involved in the creation of innovative and excellent new work, whether in be in the sciences or arts? And we have paradigmatic examples, like Mozart's and Beethoven's musical works, Leonardo and Michaelangelo's paintings, Newton and Einstein's scientific theories, or mathematical breakthroughs of Euler and Gauss.  

The question is, What mental process is responsible for these great works? As I said, much of the work on this issue is within the framework of problem-solving.  Students of Oswald Külpe, whom I mentioned earlier, created both the Gestalt and Würzburg schools of psychology. Most of the work post-WW II was directly indebted to the Würzburgers, such as Karl Bühler and Otto Selz. Popper studied under Bühler, and Herbert Simon, Nobel Prize winning Economist who was also a leader in early computer simulation of intelligence, acknowledged his debt to Selz. (Selz's own career was cut short by the Nazis, who murdered him at Auschwitz.)

The computer simulation work is definitely limited, and the Gestalt school--also a problem-solving approach--did some things that still haven't been full incorporated into more modern psychology.

One of the ideas of both the Gestalt and Würzburg schools is, I think, that there is a continuum between the most ordinary and routine problem solving, and great creative works. I suspect they are right that that there is a difference of degree, not kind, between the ordinary and great works. So there is no "secret ingredient" that genius's have, though they may have stronger imagination, focus, persistence and what you might call synthetic ability. 

On the question of struggle, I don't think that that is a necessary part of it, though I do think time is involved. To take a simple example, Popper pointed to the optical illusion of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_Cube|the Necker Cube]] as an illustration of the idea that the brain is constantly hypothesizing in an effort to solve problems. 

When we stare at the Necker cube it will keep reversing as to which corner is closer to us. Popper takes this as showing that the brain is trying to solve the problem "what is this?" and because it lacks information, the visual system keeps trying one hypothesis and then another. 

This is on the level of perception, and so much more so on the level of cognition, and the processes behind writing a symphony or painting a picture. 

Kent, I don't think that there's necessarily an emotional struggle. For Mozart, as you say, there wasn't, and with Beethoven there was. And Bertrand Russell was like Mozart when it came to writing: he would work it out in his head, and then it would just flow out of his pen, with little or no revision. 

But the theory, as I hope you see from the example of the Necker cube, is that problem-solving is so fundamental a human process that greater or lesser emotional struggle is just one thing you might study, not an essential feature. And a lot of the problem-solving work is unconscious. 

What I would be interested in is what John or Chris thinks the problem-solving framework leaves out of the creative process. 

I'm not at all stuck to this model as being the whole story, but I do know that it has proven very fruitful.  </div>

The most creative people had the same qualities as other scientists, but were distinguished by their asking new questions, or to put it another way, by a new view of the problem situation.

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, several times now, especially in your more recent posts, you have made mention of innovation and novelty, associating or even identifying creativity with innovative thinking. I have a problem with this association -- let alone identification -- because, again, I think the primary evidence of creativity is created things, and it is possible both to create things without innovative thinking and also to think innovatively without creating things. The authors to whom you have referred seem to me to be talking about innovative thinking in the context of problem solving, and I'm sure that they have interesting things to say on that topic. But simply applying the label creativity to this is begging the question if we're talking about what constitutes creativity. If we're going to get anywhere with creativity, then it needs to take into account how and why people create things, not just the process by which they have innovative thoughts about things.

You have made reference to 'creativity' in the context of scientific thought, but again what you seem to actually be talking about is particular kinds of innovative thinking and how these proceed. I'm going to suggest that the use of the term ‘creative’ in this context is metaphorical, i.e. that these processes of innovative thinking in the sciences are <em>akin</em> to the processes of creation. The reason why I'm loathe even to call such thinking creative, if not speaking metaphorically, is that the goal of science is discovery, not creation (of course, things -- both good and ill -- are created as a result of scientific discovery, but it is the discovery that is the business of science). The distinction between discovery and creation was made very well in an essay about Darwin -- written by the Harvard historian of science Steve Shapin -- in the recent issue of the <em>London Review of Books</em>: ‘Whatever might be meant by the “essence” of evolution by natural selection is something you could say was discovered; the text called the <em>Origin</em> [<em>of Species</em>] was composed, in exactly the same way that <em>Figaro</em> was composed, artfully put together, invented.’ That is to say, Darwin's creative work was not his innovative thinking about evolution, but the writing of his books that explicated that thinking, reported his findings and persuaded of his conclusions. This work is creative because something is being made, not because it is innovative thinking, and the problems to be solved within the making of this thing are the typical problems of creative work, i.e. problems of form, of composition. If creativity is associated with problem solving, then it seems to me that it is with solving that kind of problem, i.e. problems of creation. We know that problems of creation are problems of form, because בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ והארץ היתה תהו :)


PS. Shapin's essay in the LRB is well worth reading for its own sake, independent of this discussion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The phrase Einstein uses is ‘creative imagination’, which seems to me quite a precise notion and not as general or vague as ‘creativity’. Creative imagination suggests a particular kind of imagination, one that is capable of ‘creating’ new ideas or new ways of looking at something. I still think this is a metaphorical use of a notion of creation, since I don't really believe that there are such things as thoughts. I don't think one creates a thought in the same sense that one creates something tangible. When one is making something tangible, there is a clear distinction between the action of making and the thing made, between the verb (carving, writing, composing) and the object (sculpture, novel, symphony). I think it is in the nature of thinking, though, that there is no such distinction, and I'm inclined to think that thinking is all verb all the time. Thoughts only exist as mental concepts, i.e. as more thinking.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, you seem to be denying the term 'creativity' to the invention of a scientific theory, or discovery of the Pythagorean theorem. I don't think this corresponds to ordinary usage. 

"Creativity" is indeed a vague concept, and I don't want to get into the tail-chasing process of trying to define it. That's why I referred to a clear intellectual problem that a lot of people have worked on: what process is involved in innovative works in science and art.  

On your view that "I don't really believe that there are such things as thoughts."

Well some of us do indeed have thoughts, and it's a pity you don't :) 

Seriously, I think you are clinging to the English view of Locke and Hume that all knowledge is derived from sensation, which is not, I think viable in the light of many insights of modern psychology.

Again there is a history of the status of 'Thoughts'. The Wurtzburg school started with Kulpe's idea of 'imageless thoughts', about which there was much debate, but it started the much fruitful research on thinking and problem-solving.  

Popper talked about 'thoughts' being 'world three' objects, defining 'world one' as physical and 'world two' as mental. World three objects exist independently of any particular individual, and can exist in books and computer programs. It is something like Plato's 'ideas', but they can be false as well. And they have logical consequences that people can discover, etc. 

I know that some in the intellectual property field have found this a useful concept.

Look out because soon your position will imply that typefaces don't exist!  

But really, I have identified one aspect at least of creativity, and said that I find it interesting and having to do with problem-solving. 

I have asked you what aspect of creativity is not problem-solving, and you haven't given an answer. 

You have referred to the question of what motivates creativity, and that's an interesting question, but I don't think is makes any less valid the question of what process is involved in creation of a new object of art, scientific theory, or business plan. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I should have been more careful above in reporting on Popper's 'Three Worlds'. Popper would have both subjective thoughts, which are in World Two, and objective products of thought, which are in World Three. 

He says that World Three consists of the world of "products of the human mind, such as languages; tales and stories and religious myths; scientific conjectures or theories, and mathematical constructions; songs and symphonies; paintings and sculptures. But also aeroplanes and airports and other feats of engineering."

Popper distinguishes between thoughts, which are subjective, and thought contents, which are part of world three. 

So for example, Frutiger's idea that a modulated circle is 'reads' as more of a letter than a perfect circle was a thought Frutiger had subjectively at one point. It became something more objective when he made the "O" for Avenir as a physical object, but also then a pattern, a World Three object that could also be rendered as Bezier curves. 

I don't know quite what to make of Popper's three worlds metaphysics, but I find it intriguing.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Bill, thanks for the further explication of Popper's thoughts about thoughts. I don't at all like his terminology of subjective and objective thoughts, so will stick with World Two and World Three thoughts, leaving aside the implied metaphysics. I have no difficulty with World Three thoughts, because World Three is the world of created things, even if the creation in question is simply the putting something into some linguistic form: the point is that a thing is being made, composed, shaped, <em>given form.</em> This is creation, and it makes sense to say that in World Three we create thoughts in the sense of giving form to discreet ideas expressed in some medium.

What I don't believe exist are thoughts in World Two. I don't believe that the process of thinking involves production of mental things called thoughts. I challenge you to find anything amid all the electro-chemical activity of the brain that corresponds as a product, as a made thing, to a thought as expressed in World Three. We don't say, even in the laziest, most metaphorical usage, ‘I have created a thought’. We do not make thoughts, and this is why I think ‘creative thinking’ is a metaphorical use of the word creative. Even the common phrase ‘I've had a thought’, I take simply to mean ‘I have been thinking’. In grammatical terms, I consider thinking an intransitive verb.

You and I both have a commitment to ordinary usage, but we approach it in different ways. I love metaphor and wonder -- sometimes alarmed and sometimes delighted -- at just how much human communication relies on it: barely an utterance comes out of our mouths without some metaphorical content. But there are times when it is a useful and even important exercise to get behind the metaphors and consider what a word might mean or refer to if applied strictly (which is not to say restrictively; in the case of creativity, I am looking for a meaning that encompasses rather more than most people on this thread seem to want to admit). I think this exercise is important when, as in this case, there is on the one hand a great diversity in usage of a term, including metaphorical and (pre)judicial usage, and on the other hand identification of the term by some people with phenomena to which it might only apply metaphorically.

So when I start to think about ‘creativity’, I'm drawn back to a basic association with creating, of making things, because that is what the word most directly implies. All other meanings derive from that meaning.

Having run around this mulberry bush with you several times over the past week, this evening I paused long enough to consult the OED (1st ed.)...

Creative: adj. 1. Having the quality of creating, given to creating; of or pertaining to creation; originative.

I'm bemused to find no entry for creativity. Does anyone have a 2nd edition handy?</div>

To error is human.

<em>I have asked you what aspect of creativity is not problem-solving, and you haven't given an answer.</em>

Yet another one of William's faulty premises. Creativity and 'problem-solving', are two disparate faculties / abilities. One can <em>apply (or not)</em> their creativity infinite ways - one such way is to apply creativity <em>upon</em> problem-solving. 
Creativity is a power of the mind - just as Reason is another power of the mind. They are not of each other.

Okay, not strictly true. There are prepositional phrases in which the verb to think can take an object, e.g. ‘I think <em>about</em> typography’ and result in a true statement. What I don't believe is that the sentence ‘I think thoughts’ is true as a description of how the mind works, especially not in the sense that sentences like ‘I write novels’, ‘I carve sculptures’, ‘I design typefaces’ etc. may be true as descriptions of creative acts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm not distorting language. There are plenty of verbs that are typically intransitive but that may apply to prepositional phrases. Consider, for example, the verb ‘to sleep’: we don't sleep sleeps, we just sleep, although we can sleep <em>on</em> a bed. I'm suggesting that if we want to make true statements about how the mind works, rather than statements about what we do with ideas in ‘World Three’, then we should treat ‘to think’ as such a verb. We don't think thoughts, we just think. Thoughts are something we create as a result of thinking -- just as a sonata or a poem is something we create as a result of thinking -- , not a kind of mental thing within the process of thinking.

By the way, on the subject of actually making things, this new series on BBC Radio 4 is fascinating: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pgxn3">A history of the world in 100 objects</a>. I was particularly struck by the observation in the second programme, on the earliest Olduvai hand tools, that as soon as humans started to make things they began making them more complicated, and then more beautiful, than they need to be.</div>

Thought, n. 

3. A sober reflection or consideration (gave it much thought).

4. An idea or piece of reasoning produced by thinking (many good thoughts came out of the discussion).

6. (usu. in pl.) what one is thinking; one's opinion (have you any thoughts on this).

7. The subject of one's thinking (my one thought was to get away).

+++++

We usually speak of "having thoughts" (as in my joke above), or "having ideas" rather than "thinking thoughts", but that doesn't make them any less real. Particularly in so far as "ideas" and "thoughts" are a synonym, thoughts are a part of the subject of inquiry in researching creativity: "How does a creative person come up with his or her ideas?" 

But I don't know where this is going any more, because I don't understand your objection to the problem-solving model.

I don't know of a major creative act where you can say problem-solving was absent. A lot of problem-solving is unconscious work by the brain, but it can be, and has been studied.

I don't think understanding problem-solving is at all easy, but to take your metaphor, where should researchers be looking, instead of problem solving? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, my objection to the problem solving model, stated several times is that a) it is possible to solve problems without being creative and b) it is possible to be creative without solving problems. Ergo, while creativity is something that can be applied to problem solving the two things are not identical, and treating problem solving as a paradigm of creativity, while providing insights into creativity as applied to problem solving, is potentially misleading. Now, as we've also discussed, I think the Popperian idea of problem solving is over-generalised, so I'm quite sure that any examples I put forward will simply be subsumed by you into problem-solving; if ‘all life’ is problem-solving, this is inevitable. I don't believe that all life is problem-solving, and I do believe that some acts, including some creative acts or aspects of creative acts, are gratuitous.

You joked above that I might be distorting language to fit a theory, but it seems to me that you are the one who introduced a theory into this discussion and then avoided engaging with the most basic definition of creativity, which has to do with creating things. We agree, I gather, that creating things involves various kinds of problem-solving, but where we disagree is that this problem-solving component of creative acts constitutes the realm of creativity.
___

The ‘thought’ discussion is tangential, and I think we're both at or near the point of forgetting what it is tangential to. I brought it up to point out that the term creative is applied metaphorically to thinking, i.e. as a derived usage, and not as it is applied to other actions involving the making of things. Again, bearing in mind that all usages of ‘creative’ derive from this basic usage that has to do with making things. If one is starting from a derived usage and trying to suggest that this provides a paradigm, I think one is on a shaky foundation.

The definitions of ‘thought’ that you cite are all concerned with the products or subjects of thinking, not with the process of thinking. As I wrote above, I have no difficulty with thoughts as created things in Popper's World Three, where I think they take there place along other created things to which they are directly comparable. My objection is to the notion that thoughts are something like units of thinking, i.e. part of the process of thinking. It is because of this that I can only accept a phrase like ‘creative thinking’ as a metaphorical, derived usage, however common such a usage has become.</div>

That something is created.

<em>The making of tools "CAN" be a creative act but it is not necessarily so.</em>

Hmm. I think we disagree on this point. Any act that involves creating something is, by definition, a creative act. It is this non-judicial usage that I think is closest to a kind of basic meaning of the word. As soon as we start judicially distinguishing creative and uncreative acts of creating things, we run into problems and start multiplying variant usages to try to accommodate the range of things that we each, using different criteria, judge creative.

I think the 2nd edition OED definition of creativity as provided by Craig is pretty close to ideal. The only variance I would make is to point out that the power or ability to create is presumed from the evidence of created things.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, I don't think this is empty, though it is very broad. What is positive content in it is the idea of goals, obstacles to achieving them, and a search for a way to achieve the goal, often by more than one trial. This is a guiding idea for further research, in that it gives you a set of questions to ask.  

Before the problem-solving approach, I think the idea was that there is simply some inexplicable genius that is responsible for the creation of great works of art, or great ideas like the Pythagorean theorem. The idea of goal and search process has led to questions like: How to we create new solutions? What role do the boundaries of the problem have to do with it. How do we change the past patterns of thinking to come up with the new solution? How are the old and new ideas related?

I do know that in every case of creating new scientific theories that I looked at, the scientist himself had a very specific view of the problem he was trying to solve. 

The same thing is true in the book by Frutiger that I have just read. For example, in creating Avenir, Frutiger said that he had surveyed the field of type, and felt what was missing was a geometric style of sans that is readable in text. So that was his problem: how do you make the geometric style more readable. And he came up with a general idea, or rather several ideas, and then he says did a huge amount of work in trying to carry it out, and in what he feels is his masterwork of in drafting. So both in the original ideas--for example about how the O should be modulated--and carrying it out were creative--creative solutions to a problem that was well defined in his mind. 

Chris, saying "creative" is circular argument. 

Show me how in the story of Frutiger and Avenir the problem-solving framework is *limiting* my ability to understand Frutiger's creativity. And don't tell me "creativity". You have to give me something more, if you are going to explain creativity at all, give some new insight into creativity of Frutiger. 

And don't tell me I haven't fully explained Frutiger's creativity. I know that: I've only scratched the surface. But at least looking at the problem and solution, with drawings you have some insight. Just saying "creativity" tells us nothing new. The problem as conceived of by Frutiger, and his solutions in relation to it are at least informative.

By the way, have you and John actually read any of this literature? 

For example, the idea of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aha_experience|Aha experience]], of sudden insight--a term coined by Karl Buehler, Popper's teacher? 

edit: I cross-posted with John. I'll respond later.

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I think part of what I find limited about problem solving as an explanation of creativity is that it doesn't explain the genesis of the goal or, if you like, <em>the creation of the problems.</em> Some goals, and hence problems, are suggested or handed to us by circumstance, but if you place the creation of a work of art, say a painting, within the framework of problem solving you are still left with the question of why and how the artist created the goal of that particular work. As I asked very early in this discussion: what is the problem that a painting solves? There are going to be times, surely, in which we can point to some circumstantial impetus to the creation of a work of art, but I believe there are also gratuitous creative acts and this is where I think there is a hole in the goal/problem paradigm: it can't explain the genesis -- and I use that term deliberately -- of all acts of making things.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is nothing to dispute in your Frutiger-Avenir example. This is an excellent example of creative problem-solving. But I don’t think this contextualizes or exemplifies *all* creativity.

Like John, I am curious to understand the problem that a painting solves. Earlier, I put forward an example of Mozart’s Kegelstatt Trio. While obviously we cannot know Mozart’s specific motivations, I submit that there was no overarching problem, no goal. There was inspiration. 

What follows from there may have involved elements of problem-solving — “Hmm. How do I balance out this rondo? I know, let me bring that motif back from the variation and blend it with the recapitulation. Ah, problem solved.”

Using a problem-solving framework to understand a creative process certainly has its place, as you describe in your study of Frutiger.

But I agree with John, problem-solving doesn’t explain the genesis or essence of creativity.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Kent, as Craig, who is an historian of art, explained above, the letters of Van Gogh to his brother describe exactly such a problem-solving process. I don't have time to look at it again now, but there is stuff like: "I wanted to capture the quality of yellow of light on the wheat field, and I'm trying X and Y to see if it will work. I think I've got it" 

>it doesn't explain the genesis of the goal

Goals and evolution of goals is part of the problem-solving model. I suspect you folks are thinking that problem-solving is only the search process, but the model is richer than that. 

If you ask me, I think the general impulse to creativity is part of humanity being made b'tzelem elohim, in the of image God--we imitate God in this creative aspect. But Hebrew has two different words for creativity, one reserved for God, "bara," the second word in the Bible: "Beginning, created God the heavens and the earth." The other is 'yatzar', "form" and that's what we do, "form" things. I think the implication is that only the Big Guy does truly creative work, and we are futzing around rearranging the furniture by comparison. 

Back to goals. Aside from the general impulse to be creative, and the emotional satisfaction of it, the actual process is focused, and the specific goals that are the focus for a major creative work can, in my experience, regularly be identified, and in all fields of creativity. 

The gate to understanding goals is the concept of 'problem situation,' which is a translation from the German "problemstellung". When a creator is going to make something, whether it's a painting or a symphony or scientific theory, it is against the background of past problems and solutions--past works in that field. Each effort so for example Rembrandt would have been addressing his own problems, some being economic, and some technique, like light and shadow, and some perhaps capturing a certain feeling. When Van Gogh came along, he was aware of what Rembrandt had done, as well as what his contemporaries were doing, and was seeking a way to express himself differently in painting. 

Not being an historian of art, I can't tell you the story. I could tell pretty plausible accounts for the creation of a lot of typefaces, though. 

In general, Popper said that intellectual progress comes by Problem, followed by solution, followed by criticism, followed by new problems. This cycle, which creates part of the 'problem situation' a creator is facing, is the key to understanding the specific goals of a creative effort. For example, for Frutiger, the immediate background was the solutions of Futura, Kabel and Avant Garde. His criticism was that they didn't work so well in text. His effort was to solve the problem. 

I am finishing a third book that takes this approach, and I think the approach is a way to shed a lot of light on the history of culture. 

Now if you tell me: "You're never going to explain everything about creativity; they'll always be a mystery," I will answer: "Of course; *nothing* is ever fully explained by scientific explanation." But will the problem-solving approach shed light on it? You bet. 

That's why I'm frustrated with your sniping at me as historian of ideas. If you have something else to offer, do. Just saying "that's not enough" is empty. I knew that already, and you can always say it. 

Also I don't think you appreciate the depth to which the problem-solving model goes. I just saw a PBS special on what makes us human, what is distinctive about the human brain vs animals. And one of the conjectures relates to the aha! experience. We all have had the experience of worrying about some problem, and the solution coming to us days later, when we are consciously thinking of something else. That shows that the human brain is unconsciously doing massive problem-solving continually. And that is something the human brain is uniquely suited to. B'tzelem Elohim. </div>

I accept a lot of what you’re describing and have experienced a lot of it myself, as an artist, as a thinker, as a human. 

You and I seem stuck at an impasse when I say that it seems to me there can be creativity without problem-solving and when I give an example, you say No, that’s Problem-solving, and yet me feeling that there’s still something non-problem-solving there. 

You have a Historical Perspective of Ideas concept of problem-solving and I have a This Is the Way It Feels to Me concept of problem-solving. And there we have it. You have explained the concept you’re operating under quite exhaustively, and I believe that I understand it. But I don’t feel that it covers my whole experience. I am not a philosopher or logician and I don’t know that I can explain my points any more clearly. John seems better at this.

The basic issue here I think is "Can you explain 'inspiration' to some extent?" And my answer is, Yes, you can go quite far. What I don't accept this that 'inspiration' is a locked door that science can't understand quite a bit of. That's what I hear John and Chris saying. I'm saying: no it's not a locked door, the concept of problem solving has cracked it open a bit.

Van Gogh was seeking a way to express art - not himself. In fact, if you ever get a chance to speak with a <em>real</em> master they will be the first to tell that it is hard for them to get out of the way - of their own creative process.

Creativity is something of itself. Just as the power of Reason is of itself. One can apply their Creativity upon their ability to Reason. 

Chris, nice linkage. The article mentions Sam Lloyd. He was brilliant! His chess puzzles are simply awesome. And perhaps chess is a good metaphor for the power of Creativity applied to the power of Reasoning. In which case I'm reminded of the great American chess champion Paul Morphy!

I can speak of improvisation in music firsthand. I have experienced many unusual things while improvising, stopping breathing (and freaking out when I realized what was happening), once I felt myself leave my body and float above the scene. If you close your eyes while improvising it is possible to "check out". Playing music for me now is a spiritual experience, it's my meditation.

Is that going into the self, as Hrant states, or out of the self, as 5star posits? Impossible to say for sure but if I had to, I would say it's both. If you go down deep enough into yourself, you can get beyond yourself.

If you'd been there, you'd know. It is unmistakable. I am so blessed to be a musician who improvises, that lead to my first experiences. I have had other transcendental experiences under different circumstances, even stronger. But they were not unfamiliar.

Agree with you William on total focus, but you can't even shoot for that. The results are not predictable at all, there just happens to be a right time, right mood, right everything. It's something you have absolutely no control over, maybe the key is to lose control. I remember reading a piece by a Sikh woman describing their communal prayers, she said most of the time it's rote, but that every once in a while something magical happened and it became a transcendent experience.

If I knew how to trigger something like this, these experiences wouldn't be special.

		<div class="commentbody">I didn't address a key point of John: "b) it is possible to be creative without solving problems."

That's what I don't think is correct, if we are looking at the kind of excellent and innovative work that I said people have been concerned most with. 

If you give me a great creative product, in the arts or sciences, then if I could interview the maker, I could give you a story of problem-solving. 

You mention "gratuitous" creation. I don't think that happens, unless someone kicks over a bucket of paint, and then later decided they like what it did. Even the later decision has goals standards. Those might be beauty or amusement. To repeat, I am not only talking about practical problems. 

Let's look at Typeface design. Again and again the leading practitioners mention the importance of having a "brief" in order to create a good result. The brief is the parameters of a problem. The brief can change in interaction with the client, but that's about the evolution of problem through trial solutions and modification of problems that I wrote of above. </div>

If you give me the exact same product and maker and allow me to interview them, I could give you a story of something OTHER than problem solving. That comes under the heading of self-fulfilling prophesy or "seek and ye shall find"

I am not any great painter by any stretch but I have made hundreds of drawings, paintings, lithographs, etchings and woodcuts. The only few that were, to some degree, problem solving were those done in art school in response to a class assignment and most of them were pretty open. Example: Draw an insect at 100 times life size, or draw figures. More typically assignments were, "Start painting and show me something next week." If you had ever been through weekly class crits of your work, you would know that the pragmatic approach to the assignment was not getting you anywhere.

The really amazing thing to me is that I think a couple having a child is the most creative thing possible. Having the child is rarely the problem needing a solution. Now raising a child is another story all together :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, it's not self-fulfilling prophesy because my reason for being so confident that I can find a real problem-solving story is that the is account after account of creative work by the creator himself or herself describes a problem-solving process.

Take for example the story of Frutiger and Avenir. I didn't prompt him or interview him, but to the interviewers--editors of the book--he told a problem solving story: goals searches, ideas, revisions of them in light of his standards. And the final result was crucially affected by this process. 

Why what I--and he--have left out of the Frutiger story that is totally outside the problem-solving framework?

I just remembered that there is a lot of history of art by Ernst Gombrich, author of The Story of Art, that is informed by some of the same outlook as Popper. Gombrich, like Popper Studied with Bühler. I know his work is highly respected, but it's not my field. And I'm sure he wouldn't fully agree with Popper--or me. They--great friends--are alas both gone now. 

But the point is that serious, respected art history has been done in a framework related to this. 

I would pick up "Art and Illusion" and other works of Gombrich, but I have deadlines to meet, so I'd better get to them. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have no problem with the Frutiger story. It isn't about one anecdote. It is about all of the things that don't fit the anecdote that are still creative anyway. It is not something you have left out of the story. It is that the story leaves out other possible examples of creativeness that don't fit the mould as you have stated. To me, problem solving is not the sole possible domain of creativity. As I have said before, I do not know the answer, I just know the your problem solving description is not enough to pin down the phenomenon. "Eight Blue Poles" was not painted in reaction to a problem brief. Design problems (including typeface designs) are, however. Design and creativity are not synonymous though. There may be SOME correlations. I submit that a failed portrait (a portrait hated by the client) may still be a creative work even if it is rejected. The Sistine Chapel ceiling may have been a functional failure because it took so long to finish and later had blue modesty clothes painted over the nude body parts but it was a creative masterpiece however it was received in history. Creative acts can be performed either accidently or randomly without any problem set up or thought about. Perhaps creativity is the single most intangible human trait I can think of. Just because there is a ready supply of published literature on problem solving sitting under the streetlight does not mean that key to defining creativity is not either unpublished or unverbalized in the darkest shadows where no one has so far dared to look. Two humans having sex can create human life even if they don't want to and take steps to avoid it.</div>

I certainly didn't say that. What I said was that a particular line of inquiry into creative thinking applied to problem solving did not seem to me to be adequate to describing creativity. What else I said was that creativity seems to me to be a construct, and we should be wary of treating it as if it were a phenomenon; rather, we should seek to describe the range of phenomena to which this construct <em>might</em> apply.</div>

But that's exactly the kind of judicial, value usage of ‘creative’ that I've rejected consistently throughout this discussion, even when made by people with whom I otherwise agree. I believe that being most concerned with ‘excellent and innovative work’ distorts the basic meaning of creativity. It is a judicial usage to move from ability to create to ability to create excellent and innovative things. Is it possible to create non-excellent and completely unoriginal things? Yes, it is. Ergo, the ability to create that is the basic meaning of creativity must encompass such creation.

Well, based on something Bill said earlier, I’m thinking the response will be that the painting, as a whole, solves the problem of Beauty.</div>

John, I wasn't judging that less innovative things are unworthy. I was just trying to avoid getting enmeshed in a purely verbal dispute, by focusing on a set of clear examples. And these examples are I think what people have been most interested in in thinking about the issue of creativity. The concrete examples are a touchstone for relevance in a discussion, a way to keep focus. As I said, I am just following C.S. Peirce in his view that to be clear we need to keep practical consequences before us. 

Chris, I keep getting the feeling that you think that the problem-solving framework is reductionist, that I am somehow dismissing the magic and mystery of it. I don't think so. What the problem-solving framework is saying is that if creative acts are in response to goals and difficulties, so that if you ask: what was the goal? what were the difficulties? what was the trial and error process? how was it judged? You get really interesting answers—and ones that are revealing about the creative process. 

I just started looking at Gombrich, who looks very interesting. He does talk about "accidental creativity", which seems to support Chris's view that creativity just happens. But what he means, it seems, is that a relatively routine piece of work turns out in social context to have some novelty that other people latch on to, which changes styles of a whole generation. 

However, even the relatively routine creative work is goal-oriented, I think, and involves some mental or physical trial and error. Popper's example of the reversing Necker Cube illustrates how deeply the goal-trial-feedback loop is embedded in our brains and psyches.

>what problem is solved by the whole act of its creation

In some cases beauty, as Kent says, will be one goal. But this is by no means the only goal. I see, very interestingly, that Gombrich--who had a deep knowledge of art history--is very leery of 'art for art's sake'. I think that is a relatively recent concept, created in the 19th century. I get the feeling that he believes the art/craft distinction is misleading or invalid, and that goals like inspiring people in a religious work or increasing respect for rulers, or making ordinary life more interesting or fun are also common and equally valid goals. 

In other words, I think he would regard type design and easel painting as much more alike than we might think. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, I agree that we have an impulse to create, and that great artists have had it very strongly. 

But I don't agree with the Romantic theory that the creative person simply has some "genious" that gives him or her special inspiration, and out pops the creative product. 

Creative works, even though they have an impulse behind them, they have a more focused goal, and a process to reach that goal. I hate to use this metaphor, but I can't think of a better one right now: creativity is not masturbation, but making love. 

In the case of Van Gogh, here's an interesting take on a new edition of the letters:

"Van Gogh's art was not in any way a symptom of his madness. It was not even the spontaneous overflow of his powerful feelings. It was a thoroughly deliberated and self-conscious enterprise, worked out in his letters, executed on canvas and paper."

[[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-real-van-gogh-the-artist-and-his-letters-1872067.html|Here's the link to the whole review.]]

In fact, it looks like Van Gogh describes the goals and problem-solving process for many of his paintings.

What I have been arguing is that it is more than reflex response to a desire: it involves an objective, goals—and how the goals are formed and the process for reaching them tells us a lot about creativity. 

If I've been understanding you, you think all this is beside the point, not essential to creativity. I think the goals and process to reach them are at the heart of it, even though the general motive to create is also important. 

Also, I don't see how the romantic theory gets you anywhere. To me it's a closed door to any further understanding of the creative process: there's a genius, and he or she is inspired. End of story.</div>

Well, then there was a clear goal, and a standard of realism. I don't know what technique you were trying to work on, but I assume the purpose had to do with improving or keeping up your technique, so whatever you attended to would be the problem you were trying to solve, in addition to regularly checking your drawing against the person before you. 

If you were more ambitious and were trying to make some kind of artistic statement, then probably more would be involved. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, Chris,

Perhaps part of the reason for our disconnect -- and at this stage I'm more inclined to think of it in these terms than as a disagreement --, is that the experience of creativity varies significantly, and while there are parallels between creativity in the sciences and in the arts, there are experiential differences that should be acknowledged and described. While a problem solving framework may be used to describe any creative act if one's concept of problem solving is sufficiently general, it seems to me that such a framework fits the experience of creativity in the sciences more easily than it fits that of creativity in the arts; that is, for a scientist, creativity <em>feels</em> like problem solving, whereas for an artist it might feel quite different. I'm not suggesting a general division, by the way: one has only to read the accounts of artists talking about different works to realise that their experience of creativity varies.

Rilke's account of the initial inspiration of the <em>Duino Elegies</em> in 1912 is a classic case of something that, at least experientially, doesn't seem like problem solving. In retrospect, if one were committed to a problem solving explanation, I think one could come up with one even to account for this flurry of inspiration, but for Rilke it felt like something else. Interestingly, after the initial burst of inspiration that resulted in the first two elegies and fragments of the others, the writing stalled for the better part of a decade. What this indicates is that a conscious problem solving approach without the inspiration was insufficient to this act of creation: no amount of working on the poems as if they were problems that could be solved by effort, skill and intelligence would result in their completion. It was only in 1922, in a ‘savage creative storm’ that Rilke not only completed the elegies but also composed the <em>Sonnets to Orpheus.</em> Again, I'm not suggesting that no problem solving framework can be built around these creative acts, but that to the poet they were not experienced as problem solving but as a ‘storm’.

I suspect people in the sciences -- or for that matter in business -- experience creativity as problem solving because they have predefined goals independent of individual creative acts. Because the defining characteristic of art is extra-utility (which may include ‘self-expression’ but that is <em>not</em> the defining characteristic of art, as most of the world's artistic heritage demonstrates), there tend to be fewer predefined goals, and hence the genesis of the creative impulse is less easily grasped.

While a problem solving framework may be useful in many ways, I think we need to be able to talk about creativity in terms of the experience of the people who are creating; indeed, we need to be aware that insisting on a framework that fails to take into account that experience may damage and inhibit creative activity. As an example, I have a friend whose improvisational musical ability was pretty much killed by taking a university music course on jazz performance. The framework of understanding jazz performance presented by the course undermined his natural talent.</div>

Yes that's it.

>What this indicates is that a conscious problem solving approach without the inspiration was insufficient to this act of creation

John, I think part of the disconnect is that, having studied historical examples of scientific creativity, I know that inspiration is also required for science. I never meant to indicate that problem-solving and inspiration are opposed. On the contrary, unless the problem is very routine, inspiration is required, in the sense of some process, mainly unconscious, of getting a solution from we know not where. What the problem-solving approach does is get us a bit further into the process than just saying "inspiration". 

That's because the premise of the problem-solving approach is that the inspiration comes in service of the effort to achieve a goal, with some boundaries of what's a good solution or product. 

When you do try to reconstruct a creator's problem-situation, then I think you start to understand some of the creative process, even though a lot of it remains unknown. And that holds true for both science and the visual arts. 

There is a difference with the visual arts, even compared to say fiction, in that it's a lot harder to describe the goals and standards. Further, the goals generally evolve more in producing an artistic product than a scientific one.  

So there are differences, but I wouldn't put them down to inspiration vs plodding.

Also, after reading Gombrich's skepticism about 'art for art's sake', I am skeptical about your contention that "the defining characteristic of art is extra-utility". I think there are markets for art and social utility to what is produced. --And that social view of art—which changes—is part of the problem-situation that guides artists. For example, Gombrich writes about traditions of 'connoisseurship'.   </div>

All of what you just said focuses on the worlds viewers as witnesses to creativity, or talking about it to eachother. I don't see how an art historian or critic can really understand the process unless they also are producers of something creative. John, a friend of mine of several years back, was a gifted sculptor who won a prize at one of the Pittsburgh International Art Exhibitions in the 70s. His large work was featured prominently at the Carnegie Museum of Art along with other noted pieces from the show. He and I were looking through the show as were groups of tourists. While we were looking at his piece, a docent came by with a group of tourists and proceeded to "explain" my friend John's sculpture to them. She had no idea that John was the artist and standing right behind her. She went on about what the piece was "saying" and how it came about in a most convincing and confident way that had been polished by many repetitions. After she finished and moved on, my friend John said to me in a loud enough voice that everyone could overhear, "Where to they get all of this bullsßit!" The group of tourists looked at John, who looked more like a steel worker than an artist, as if he had blasphemed and that surely, the docent knew best.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, ‘extra-utility’ refers to the characteristic quality of art that is found in virtually all human-made things, including predominantly utile objects (like Chris' lovely hammer collection). It does not refer to ‘art for art's sake’. This quality is observable across such a wide range of different object, periods and cultures, that I think it must be considered the defining characteristic of art, to which more localised characteristics are added. Something like social utility of art or traditions of connoisseurship are culture-specific, they are ways in which societies may interact with art. But the making of art, or of things with this extra-utile quality of art, precedes those interactions and is independent of them. As the British Museum's Neil MacGregor pointed out in his introduction to the BBC <em><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/explorerflash/">History of the world in 100 objects</a>,</em> almost as soon as humans start to make things, they start to make them beautiful, and that beauty is not a quality that is necessary to the utility of the object, it is extra-utile.

I suppose you can, in the way in which problem solving can be generalised, do something similar to the notion of utility, such that everything humans do can be put within a utile framework. But I don't think there is any benefit to such an approach, because it erases the one clear characteristic by which one can identify art.</div>

Not only can I understand that speech, but relate to it; few years ago I was on a gold claim of my friend in Lapland, and – while sitting on "riuku", a basic outhouse – I saw a "porotokka"; that's Finnish version of Samic word for a heard of reindeers across the gully the claim was on. That evening I carved a picture of that image of the image on an old piece of wood, and gave that to my friend.</div>
