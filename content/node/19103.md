  vibe (think capote, black-and-white ball, etc).\r\n\r\ni'm just not sure where to
  go with the type treatment at this point. i was thinking maybe an ultra condensed
  sans-serif like univers??\r\n\r\nany other suggestions? i'm kinda stuck"

    Gothic Extended or Helvetica Neue Extended come to mind. Script is also very sixties,
    particularly Stormtype''s Splendid Script. '
