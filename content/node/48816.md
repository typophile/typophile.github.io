  in New Zealand. We need to use a typeface (frutiger) that has macrons so we can
  correctly type out the Maori (native language of NZ) language. In particular we
  need to get an 'a' which has a horizontal dash over top of it. I can see it in the
  Glyphs (the symbol that is, not the complete 'a' with a dash over it) but was wondering
  if there is anyway of creating it so that I can place the symbol over the 'a'. Obviously
  I could layer it, but this would be tedious and counter productive, I can change
  the tracking so it overlaps (-250em) but thats not ideal either. \r\n\r\nAnyone
  has any ideas?   "

    why Latin-1 requires the macron (and some other characters) but not the combined
    letters accented with the macron!"

  body: "It would add a lot of glyphs to the font. A <em>lot</em>. The Frutiger I
    have is a Type 1 font, and there the number of characters was limited to 256,
    so they decided to include just the macron and let the user figure it out from
    there. Which is not too bad, actually. Given the proper software, the user would
    never notice. (I'm still waiting for that one, though.)\r\n\r\nThe macron isn't
    unique in this; a \"proper\" font (one that cares about more than English) contains
    separate characters for circumflex, caron, acute, grave, dieresis, ring, and --
    if the designer <em>really</em> was internationally focused -- dot above, tilde,
    ogonek. Imagine a separate character for each of these on each of the vowels!
    And by now, most of them also appear above, below, or through consonants as well.
    (Even worse -- for use, poor typesetters --, accents may also be combined.)\r\n\r\n<cite>I
    can change the tracking so it overlaps (-250em) but thats not ideal either.</cite>\r\n\r\nThere
    aren't many more options to do this. If you're really convinced the character
    should be in it, you could add the macron vowel combinations to the font. That
    means you're modifying an existing font, though. You could also create a 'macron-only'
    font -- but that would require you to copy the vowels and loose macron from the
    original, and that is probably frowned upon as well."

  body: "Of course, if you put your macron vowels in a separate font they won't kern
    with the main font, as kerning doesn't work between fonts.  You might be able
    to work around this in InDesign by defining a character style with \"Optical\"
    kerning (recently criticized in another forum topic) to apply to words containing
    macrons.\r\n\r\nOne of these days we may get SING Glyphlets in versions of InDesign
    other than Japanese, a way to add supplementary characters to a font.  I don't
    know whether glyphlets will kern -- I don't have Japanese ID to experiment with
    (although Fontlab's SigMaker 3 can make glyphlets).  But glyphlets could prove
    really useful for those wanting to use nice fonts legally with diacritics."
