		<div class="commentbody">I have had a couple of idea about this - one is that games are not type centered for the most part - they are explosion centered or something similar. So type takes a back seat. Another is that games are about instant gratification and type that supports a feeling/sensibility rather than the needs of legibility is going to win out. Yet another is that your complaint might be about any one or more of several possible type &ldquo;problems&rdquo; I have seen in games. So&hellip; I am not sure which one or more you might be referring to. In fact, I hesitated to even post at all because of the vague nature of your statement.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Most game designers are concerned with style, rather than legibility, as Eben said. They view type as a way to emphasize the setting or atmosphere of the game, and less as a data source. This is ironic, of course, as gamers depend on the HUD to give them instant-access information that is directly tied to their performance in the game world. Valve Software does a good job with <i>Half-Life 2</i>, using DIN <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:800px-City17HL2.jpg">throughout the HUDs</a> of the three chapters out so far, as well as a legible screen font for small type (not sure which, offhand. Probably Verdana.) They have a keen eye for graphic design along with an incredible game design sense. Kind of like Pixar in many ways.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s also hit another issue on the nose, particularly with PC games (vs console). The advent of HD has also lead some developers to typeset info that is completely illegible on SD TVs. So lame.</p>
<p>If I had the free time, I&rsquo;d love to write a paper on HUD/interface design in games.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No kidding it&rsquo;s frequently distorted and blurrrry.</p>
<p>The games I&rsquo;ve seen on my wife&rsquo;s DS, tend to have a lot of text. Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy both have involved story lines, all of which is conveyed in text. There is quite a bit of reading to do to get through games, and the text is  in crummy looking dot matrix fonts or worse. My sons' X-Box games are sometimes practically unreadable, with fonts that seem  to have been chosen with no thought as to how they&rsquo;d render on screen. The graphics seem like they should support decently rendered legible typography.</p>
<p>My eyesight is not bad for my age, but my eyes do tend to get tired quickly if I have to struggle to read something because the type is NFG. I&rsquo;ll just put it aside. It occurred to me that perhaps one of the reasons I hate playing video and computer games is the lousy typography.</p>

<p>Minimizing data? It&rsquo;s just type. My kids and my wife think they could minimize data by cutting useless bits of story-line they prefer to skip.</p>
<p><cite>and your being unused to the medium</cite></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s me sqinting at the screen saying &ldquo;Holy crap! Who do they expect the read that??&rdquo; :o) For the money that goes into developing these things, you&rsquo;d think they could do some decent (readable) typography!</p>

<p>BTW, I think Oblivion did a pretty good job, with it&rsquo;s hundreds of in-game books. The letters could&rsquo;ve been a bit less fuzzy, but overall, the text was pretty legible and well set (for a video game).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I haven&rsquo;t found the text to be that bad in the recent games I&rsquo;ve played, but the image that oprion posted is a large part of the reason of the current trends, I think.</p>
<p>Basically, if a gamer thinks of a &ldquo;hard-core&rdquo; gaming text style, they&rsquo;ll thinking back to the video classics.  Once a lot of games moved from 8 bit to 16 bit and on, they kept a similar style.  Newer series couldn&rsquo;t break too much.</p>
<p>RPGs of course have more text than most, and even though it&rsquo;s often bitmap, it&rsquo;s not that tiring.  Also age could play a factor.  Mario is designed to be played by a generally younger crowd (or at least enabled to be played by them) while Halo 3 is for older people who probably have HDTVs and sit right next to the screen and can use the itty bitty tiny text.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some games that I have seen recently, such as the latest Need for Speed offering (in Australia.. so it has possibly been succeeded by multiple new versions in the US&hellip;) actually have really great typefaces and type treatment in-game on the PC.</p>
<p>I often think it must be pretty hard to configure type behaviour in games like World of Warcraft, where each player has their name bobbing above their heads, and the size of the type changes every millisecond depending on your perspective and distance from it as you run between and among up to hundreds of people. It never seems to look too hideous at all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m impressed with the knowledge here about older (1990&rsquo;s and older) video games and their role in typography (Oh Zork, how I loved you.). Usually in today&rsquo;s day and age it seems to be overlooked by younger generations.</p>
<p>On to the topic, most electronic games tend to desire function over form when it comes to typography. As a few already have pointed out, letters on old or hand held systems were designed the way they were due to the pixel resolution&rsquo;s limitations. Though, I agree, wading through sentence after sentence of an old final fantasy game with text larger than my character can get slow and choppy.</p>
<p>For a while there games were concentrated on either PC or consoles, consoles had their resolution limitations (640x480, yuck!) while PC&rsquo;s could obtain much higher resolutions and provide better readability. Now a days game designers are focusing on the console crowd and higher resolutions as a second option and to focus on this is to work within limitations of screen and input options, resulting in poor typographic choices on a reading level (Oblivion and Deus Ex 2, I&rsquo;m looking at you.). Thankfully this HD craze might help push game designers in a direction where all our eyes can be happy. Although I will argue that not being creative within constraints isn’t an excuse for bad type.</p>
<p>Part of the problem within game companies would be ignorance in typography. However, some execute this very well and as a system (as mentioned, Valve’s Half-Life 2) while others do what is right in terms of context (console style type, Ion Storm’s Deus Ex 1).</p>
<p>I also think context is a big issue in game typography that&rsquo;s generally avoided (except in, maybe, the over used &ldquo;future&rdquo; and &ldquo;outer-space&rdquo; style typography). If you&rsquo;re going to place a game in a certain time period, the designer should take account of the appropriateness of the type choices on many different reading levels.</p>
<p>I have to disagree with being used to the medium. I mean, I know exactly what you mean in terms of game play and how to use a game, but no one should get used to bad type.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think this is a good point, perhaps there needs to be better graphic design practices in game design.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a side note to the above thoughts, how Typography takes a backseat:</p>
<p>I have lost count of the amount of hours I&rsquo;ve spent playing Final Fantasy games, and even now&hellip; in trying to visualize the type they utilized it just doesn&rsquo;t come to mind. (Strangely though I can see the X in Final Fantasy 8 very well and it&rsquo;s bitmappy as hell).</p>
<p>I think it goes without saying that, type takes a very, very, very far back seat. You have to remember that people will first be looking at the graphics. Something else important to remember is that type takes its most prevalent forms in two ways in video games:</p>
<p>Dialogue and Menus.</p>
<p>While you can make the argument that people will or will not notice the type in dialogues, Menu surfing, I&rsquo;ve found, becomes systematic. If I&rsquo;m pausing to restore a character&rsquo;s heath, or to switch out a weapon I do it so quickly because I want to get back to the action! I think eventually, the menus become physical interface to our functional desires as opposed to these self-guiding mechanisms where we need to read the type. Every. Single. Time.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just how it goes.</p>
