    but the only people who give a damn, or even notice, are font nerds. Doing something
    quirky like this is fun and interesting, and I\u2019m sure that the designer who
    specified Stop had a sense of humor and knew that these letters will get swapped
    out at the next renovation anyway."

    the building is from the 70s. "

    like old Beaux-Arts-derivative institutional architecture, probably post-Victorian.
    I'd guess maybe 1910 or 1920?"

    \ Archaica is correct that building is definitely from the teen's or maybe the
    20's given its transitional, modernizing beaux-artsiness.\r\n\r\n"
