body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for alternatives for Kursivschrift (classic map
  typeface). I'm looking for something that has a simular feel, but maybe slightly
  more modern and less quirky. Connected letterforms would be nice, but not a must.
  I want to use it on maps, together with Unitus (probably) and perhaps Photina.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJeffrey"

    is slightly different, as I'm looking for an alternative for this specific cartographic
    font. But thanks anyway."
