    on the point of view of the observer and how flexible the observer is. You're
    disputing what is aesthetically pleasing. What looks good to the individual is
    a subjective quality. So your statement is a personal observation, and my assertion
    that these ligs look good is a personal observation.\r\n\r\nAnything anyone cannot
    handle after that&#8212;you are on your own.\r\n\r\nNo black & white. The solution
    to a lot of the pointless disputes occurring at Typophile is to recognize that
    we don't all see the world the same way and just agree to disagree.\r\n\r\nThat's
    an arseload easier than getting involved in petty pissing matches.\r\n\r\n<em>All
    ligatures are somewhat detrimental to spacing flexibility. In James\u2019 example,

    too tight?</em>\r\n\r\nNeither. You misunderstand the nature of the font and lack
    knowledge of its modes of operation. And if I hadn't shown the unligated letter
    combos above the ligatures you would not have known they differed. By \"were the
    originals too loose?\" you mean to say \"are the stand-alone glyphs too loose?\"
    \ Rhodaelian has several ligature modes. The raw LIGA and DLIG modes apply ligatures
    with no spacing adjustment of stand-alone glyphs. HIST offers spacing compensation
    for all stand-alone glyphs to match the density of the ligatures. CALT offers
    spacing of stand-alone glyphs halfway between normal (uncompensated) and the full
    compression of HIST mode.\r\n\r\n<em>And then there is the \u201Cwhere does it

    has more ligatures than those shown. 67 in total. I posted a sample of the units

    halfway between normal (uncompensated) and the full compression of HIST mode.</em>\r\n\r\nActually
    that was a big fat lie. I made it up to satiate David's conclusion the ligatures
    in Rhodaelian are spaced at about 50% of the mean spacing value of the stand-alone
    glyphs. I wanted to see if anyone would realize what a poorly designed font Rhodie
    would be if it had ligatures that didn't match the density of normal spacing of
    the stand-alone glyphs and relied on a spacing program to compensate everything
    else when the ligs are in use. David based his estimate of the density of the
    ligatures and arrived at a normal spacing value based on a selective picture showing
    ligatures only. When you can see more the rest of the font it makes a lot more
    sense and you'd be less likely to jump to an incorrect conclusion.\r\n\r\nAs you
    can see in this sample, it isn't like that at all. I designed the ligs in Rhodie
    to match the normal spacing and stroke density. No spacing compensation needed
    for those ligatures. No ma'am.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flimflam_6551.gif]\r\n\r\nNyah,

    not everything that looks like a ligature is a ligature, and some apparent ligatures

    tracking is getting beyond the reasonable limit in my opinion; and in the case
    of this font the ligature substitution would normally turn off beyond +16 units
    (see below).]\r\n\r\nI've given up on ligatures in the traditional typographic
    sense of a single sort (glyph, piece of metal, etc.) representing more than one
    letter, and have moved to using ligating contextual alternates.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ffi_4083.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
    mechanism also makes it possible to cater for ligation of arbitrary diacritic
    letter sequences, which is useful if, like me, one is making fonts for more than
    European languages and can't always anticipate what users will need or want.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arbitraryligs_6504.gif]\r\n\r\nBy
    putting the contextual lookups for these substitutions withing the <liga> layout
    feature, one can take advantage of InDesign's tracking tolerances for ligatures
    (and one can also design the ligating glyphs with those in mind. At TypeCon this
    year, I asked Eric Menninga about these tolerances, i.e. the point at which InDesign
    disables the <liga> feature for tracked text. He checked, and reported that they
    are not fixed tracking units but are based on percentages of the width of the
    word space glyph of the particular font: +8% or -22%. So if a font has a word
    space width of 200 units then the <liga> feature will switch of beyond +16 units
    tracking and -44 units tracking."

    will have a look at those other ligs. The interesting thing about the Oneleigh
    \"swash t\" combinations is how far the font can be tracked out or in before the
    alignment starts to run out of usable range. No matter which solution a type designer
    chooses to use&#8212;a  fixed width ligature or a kerned / fitted pair&#8212;tracking

    \r\n\r\nTo go back to the gotham example ( is that what you mean David?) , if
    the t shapes and side bearings were different at the end of a word vs when they
    were inside a word, you could improve the spacing.  Or better still, if the shape
    of the t depending on the specific shapea next to it you could control the relationships/spacing/white
    shapes even more precisely. And if that were the case, then, from my point of
    view if the solution happens to be a ligature or not is suddenly a style question
    not a spacing question which is a far more ideal state of affairs."
