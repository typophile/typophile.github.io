  required to chose a letter, find 20 differnt versions of the letter, then find 20
  images that started with the letter and paste it into our sketchbook anyway we choose.
  \r\n\r\nI chose the letter S and tried to find images that started with that letter
  that served multiple purposes, for example the legs have Stockings, Shoes and Stripes
  and the Fork image has Silverware and Spaghetti. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StripedStockings_blog_4756.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nI too wonder why S is so popular. I chose it for a few reasons,
    one because I worked with the letter before in Type I to depict the word flowing,
    its so curvaceous and because I thought it would appear more frequently than any
    other letter. I found plenty of the letter s, but found it difficult to find the
    images starting with s."

    letter people choose...it does seem to me there are some more\r\nthan others...perhaps
    i will assign a letter next time! i mean no one\r\nused x y or z..."
