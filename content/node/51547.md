  already identified the 'TRUCKING, INC.' as a horizontally stretched Bitstream Handel
  Gothic. I have a sneaking suspicion the 'Amoth' may be custom drawn, but I thought
  I'd post it all since I need help with the 'Gary' anyway ('Gary' looks so familiar
  yet I can't place it).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "Florian: Looking at it, there does seem to be a definite resemblance to Antique
    Olive. In the end, though, I ended up retracing it (sometimes faster than finagling
    type).\r\n\r\nSeb: Bingo!\r\n\r\nThanks to both of you!"
