body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI am working on a script font and I need to have some glyphs
  which have different versions depending if they are in the middle of the word or
  when they are at the end (sometimes at the beginning).\r\n\r\nI've been using CALT
  for this situations. When I pair the glyph to the SPACE character, then I call the
  alternative version. But Is that correct? What happen if I need the initial or final
  form and the space character is not present (like in a title).\r\n\r\nShould I use
  the features that are most used in arabic instead?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_6412.jpg]"

  body: "A good start for individual situations is the following:\r\n\r\nfeature calt
    {\r\n  sub n b' by b.alt5;\r\n  sub m b' by b.alt5;\r\n  sub space @lc' by @lc.alt;\r\n}
    calt;\r\n\r\nIf opentype will find an instance of nb or mb it will change the
    b (since it has been accented with the apostrophe) with b.alt5.\r\nYou can also
    work with groups by adding the prefix @. If a space is followed by one or more
    letters in the group lc, it will change the first letter to the other group.\r\n\r\nIt's
    really easy once you get the hang of it."

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nMmmhh... I think I didn't explain myself well. I know how
    to make alternates to call 'alt' versions of the characters. \r\nI also did use
    the same method ( sub b' space by @b.alt ) to have a ending version of the 'b'.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is: the default 'b' has an appendix (see the image above) used for a better
    linking with the other letters. I need to have the ALT version of the 'b' (with
    no appendix) at the end of words. It is easy if there is a SPACE character after,
    but... what happen when it is a title and there is no character after? How can
    I call the ending form of the 'b?.\r\n\r\nTIA.\r\n"
