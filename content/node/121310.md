  body: "Fcraft is very close, but there are subtle differences:\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/fcraft.font?text=1994PROGRESS+1889+MI\r\n\r\nSome
    form of DIN seems to be the base font (before the distressing/rounding). PF DIN
    Text Universal Bold comes very close:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-din-text-universal/\r\n\r\nThere
    is a rounded version of DIN, but like Fcraft it\u2019s not quite a match:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/din-next-rounded/"

  body: As I don't know any rough/corroded/eroded version of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/din|DIN]]
    (not Next or Text versions to avoid oblique-cut terminals), that might be a home-made
    post-treatment for Carhartt based on it.

  body: Just throwing in my two cents. It doesn't look like same letters are distressed
    exactly the same. There could be alternative versions of each but I'm guessing
    it was roughed up after.
