    a London 70, but there are other good choices in the set&#41;. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bauhaus/">Bauhaus</a>.
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/washington/">Washington</a>. All of
    these fonts are much better than the freeware junk you linked.

    bahaus and didn&#39;t like washington...I do really like the chalet family but
