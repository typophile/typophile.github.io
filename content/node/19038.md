  body: "Eric, in FontLab Studio 5, press [Command] + T to open the Actions dialogue
    window.\r\n\r\nUnder \"Metrics\", go to \"Set sidebearing\u2026\"\r\n\r\nEnter
    in 0 for \"Left SB\" and 0 for \"Right SB\"\r\nCheck the box at the bottom that
    says \"Apply to entire font\".\r\n\r\nIn Fontographer, there is a command from
    the pull-down menus at the top of the screen for deleting all metrics. It is called
    something like \"Clear all Metrics\" or \"Delete all Metrics\". I can't quite
    remember.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it would be rather silly to show a font without
    character spacing. Such a font does not exist, and displaying one belies the nature
    of type design. The white space around each glyph is as much a part of the glyph
    as the black \"glyph\" you see. And when you drew your letters at the beginning,
    I'm sure that you didn't draw them so that their extremities were touching each
    other! You have always had space in your font, just not your final spacing. Deleting
    your metrics will not present an \"earlier\" version of your font\u2026 it will
    just confuse and mislead the viewer."
