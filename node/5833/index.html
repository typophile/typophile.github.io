		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany, I think the exact opposite. As I wrote in my letter to Emigre (in #53), it only makes sense that the entire motivation to create the Deseret alphabet was in fact intentional segregation, better termed anti-assimilation. As any threatened minority will tell you, being different helps you stay yourself. Remember that the Mormons carried out an auto-exodus to the middle of nowhere. <BR> <BR>The Deseret alphabet failed because: <BR>1) It's very hard to pull off something like that. <BR>2) Its readability is low: not enough letter-divergence, and too much of the divergence is internal.  <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ok. I guess I have to respond. :^/ This is where I wish I would've paid more attention to the history classes at school. <BR> <BR>i believe polygamy served a purpose at that time of the church for a very specific reason. i also believe that it would have ended anyway, but what a coincidence that it ended for statehood. (everything happens for a reason &hellip; luther/gutenberg, religion/scriptures, missionaries/books) agh this is becoming a new thread &hellip; sorry. <BR> <BR>wasn't the army actually formed for protection? (again probably slept through this one) <BR> <BR>I won't completely say you are wrong Hrant. Your two points make sense. As does you anti-asssimilation point. They had been persecuted out of several areas. But i think the main point is that the Church has had missionaries from the word go. For this religion (any religion or group of people that wish to share or discuss something) to work the missionaries had to have books in the language of those with whom they were proselytizing. It made no sense in the end to form a new language if they really wanted the missionaries to be able to go around the world. They would have had to first have people accept the message and learn a new language. This would take everyone back in time when only a select group could actually read the scriptures. (I'm sure I'm losing track of my thoughts) I believe that the message was to be shared and they realized it couldn't have been and so abandoned Deseret. Instead focusing on learning other international languages and translating the Book of Mormon into those languages. (today for instance the Book of Mormon can be had in 111 <a href="http://www.ldscatalog.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/%20CategoryDisplay?%20catalogId=10001&amp;storeId=10001&amp;categoryId=100054&amp;langId=%20-1&amp;parent_category_rn=100003&amp;bcname=Missionary%20Book%20of%20Mormon&amp;top=%20Y&amp;resetCat=N&amp;initBC=Y&amp;level=2&amp;replBC=subcatlist100003&amp;fromHomeBC=Y" target="_blank">diffe rent</a> languages, give or take a few) <BR> <BR>All organizations, religions, groups, etc. that wish to talk to others either have to find common ground on which to discuss (whatever topic, type for instance) or find a way to talk the language of those whom they wish to speak. That is, I believe, the real reason behind the alphabet being abandoned. That is not to say the Church only uses the latin alphabet though. Today the Book of Mormon is available in over 111 different languages (as well as the King James version of the bible, used also and in conjunction with the BoM) <BR> <BR>If you had something you wanted to share with as many people as possible, wouldn't you do what you could to translate it into something they could read? I don't think there is one golden alphabet, all alphabets are equally amazing and important. <BR> <BR>i've said too much. ok. i'll be quiet now. (try to anyway.) :^)</div>

If someone phones me and says, 'We need a Hebrew font for use in business communication', that inspires something different from saying 'We need a Hebrew font for critical editions of the Hebrew Bible'. I can't always describe how this inspiration works, or why a particular need, expressed by the client, pushes me in a particular direction. But the client's needs are the start of inspiration. They also, helpfully, act as a compass during the design exploration: I know what the destination is supposed to be, even if I don't know exactly what it looks like yet.</div>

So maybe Mormons have always wanted to preach their beliefs. But at least during the formative period they were also rightly worried about self-preservation. These two things are in conflict, and I wouldn't be suprised if the Mormons most anxious to spread the word were silently cursing the whole Deseret thing. And maybe they just won in the end, because the Mormon community became more confident and secure. If one day that's no longer true, don't be surprised to see Deseret make an abrupt return. <BR> <BR>And don't be so apologetic about polygamy. Marriage can be said to be just as problematic. <BR> <BR>What's Adamic? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, I think there's a difference between demonstrable fraud on the lines of an individual making a claim about e.g. a translation of a text which is then proven to be a fantastic fabrication, and mounting an exegetical and historical investigation to suggest an alternative view of early Christianity and its relationship to Pharisee Judaism. The latter is interesting, as are other recent books that paint a quite different picture of Paul, i.e. Paul as himself an observant Jew and not representing a radical break and a new religion. Both these lines of thought about Paul are based on consideration of the New Testament texts and on historical investigation. Neither <i>proves</i> its case, and neither proves that the traditional Christian version is incorrect. I have no problem with this kind of intellectual, critical investigation of my religion, because I'm interested in truth. This also means that I'm interested in seeing the limits of such investigations &ndash; as regards proof &ndash; acknowledged. <BR> <BR>The matter of Joseph Smith is of a different order: various of his claims are demonstrably <i>proven</i> to be false. He probably didn't think anyone would ever actually decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic script, so he could make up whatever he wanted. Ironically, at almost exactly the same time, Champollion was making the first accurate decipherment of ancient Egyptian texts. <BR> <BR>I think it is always necessary to question authority, to question the basis on which authority is claimed. And I say this as a member of the Catholic Church, which claims for itself the most extraordinary authority. Faith and gullibility are not good partners, but faith and intellect are. As Simone Weil wrote: true authority has nothing to fear from the pursuit of truth. <BR> <BR>Tiffany and I are continuing this in e-mail, so I'm perfectly happy to stop talking about Mormonism on Typophile.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Synchronicity. <BR> <BR>There are many type design &quot;ideas&quot; kicking around my head, themes which interest me. I recognize these themes in typography I come across, explored to varying degrees. This can point in new directions. I also recognize other themes which can interact with the ones I have. Believing in synchronicity, I pursue obscure, eclectic lines of research in the expectation that this will increase the likelihood of serendipity occuring. I shake up my circumstances from time to time,  For instance&hellip; <BR> <BR>I'm moving at the moment, and am packing up a lot of stuff and throwing other stuff out. I was going to throw out a 1994 Bazaar, but the type caught my eye. It was set in HTF Didot, and the art director had combined different sizes of the face in the same (department heading) word, with the appropriate optical scaling. That reminded me of the way that the ultra thin weights of Luc de Groot's &quot;Taz&quot; work &ndash; a similar kind of optical scaling (I had been talking with Luc about that at TypeCon). It was an idea I had explored a little with the ultra thin weights of Bodoni Egyptian. A few months ago I went to see &quot;M&quot;, Fritz Lang's 1929 film, at a movie theatre, and was very taken with the title lettering. Of course I couldn't see it clearly, as the image was scrolling and somewhat distressed, so I was perhaps imagining things that weren't there. Anyway, I later tried to draw it from memory as an alphabet, but couldn't decide on the x-height. So I'm thinking maybe I can do it with just one weight, but in a family that has many members with different x-heights, from absurdly tiny to what looks practically like a unicase, with vestigial extenders. So that could be mixed and matched too, as the Bazaar art director did. New principles to structure a typeface family (other than roman/italic, weight, and horizontal scaling) &ndash; that's another theme in my work.  <BR> <BR>This may turn out to be a typeface that is &quot;the answer to a question that nobody asked&quot;, but what the heck. <BR> <BR>Why do particular design themes inspire me? I don't know if they inspire me, it's more like I find them &quot;useful&quot; (in the way that soccer commentators describe a pass) for setting up the kind of design puzzle that I will enjoy tackling, with an eventual sense of accomplishment when it's finished. <BR> <BR>As for &quot;from what source do you derive the passion&quot;, well, the &quot;why&quot; question, especially with such purple phrasing, is going to get the heavy answers, ain't it? I like the St. Augustine rationale: I believe in order to understand. I've answered the question before, similarly, with &quot;for me, type design is an epistemological pursuit &quot;, and been accused of pretentiousness. Yes, it is a fancy word, and I always have to look it up in the dictionary to check the spelling and make sure it means what I think it does. But how else does one respond to &quot;why do you exist?&quot;  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">My respect for individual religions is based upon the claims of those religions and how well those claims stand up to scrutiny, not the sincerity of their followers. If someone wants to believe that God is an invisible white rabbit named Harvey because someone claiming to be divinely inspired told him it was so based upon a demonstrably false translation of an Egyptian funeral text, I'm not going to respect that simply on the basis of the sincerity of the belief. People have sincerely believed all sorts of nonsense throughout history, and we can love them and even respect the genuineness of their beliefs, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't question <i>what</i> they believe. The falsity of the so-called 'Book of Abraham' is obvious in light of the accurate translation of the same papyri by Egyptologists. I refuse to believe that a lie can bring anyone closer to a true understanding of God. <BR> <BR>Joe, I wouldn't want you or anyone else to respect my religion based on my sincere desire to practice it. I hope William, for example, acknowledges the genuineness of my belief in the claims of Catholicism, but I'm also glad that he is critical and willing to challenge those claims. As I wrote to Tiffany in e-mail, it is not my intent to offend or upset anyone, any more than I think it is William's intent to upset or offend me when he suggests that Christianity is a myth invented by St Paul that bears little relationship to Christ's actual life or teachings, even though this constitutes an attack on the fundamentals of my religion. These are valid questions and reasonable challenges with which Catholic apologetics should be willing to engage. There are also valid questions and challenges to fundamentals of Mormonism, many concerning the authority of Smith's revelations, that intelligent Mormons should be willing to engage with. <BR> <BR>I also think that Jews have a responsibilty to be critical of Christianity, because Christian beliefs undermine Judaism in ways that cannot be reconciled. Similarly, Christians have a responsibility to be critical of Islam and, yes, Mormonism, because these undermine Christianity. When one religion derives some of its beliefs from an earlier religion, but interprets that religion in new and radical ways, the followers of the older religion have every right to object. Mormonism hijacks and distorts important aspects of my religion. I'm well aware that, from the Jewish perspective, my religion hijacks and distorts aspects of Judaism, which is why I have no right to demand that William or any other Jew have respect for what I believe even though, obviously, I do not share that perspective.</div>

There would be some noise, but it would be muffled by the huge mainstream anti-muslim sentiment. Even apologizing to muslims has become bad business, and sucking up to our true masters has become (well, it always was) good business. Just like Spiekermann said at TypeCon about Nazi Germany: people who weren't really Nazis put small swastikas here and there to gain favor.

Freedom of speech only exists in theory - in practice anti-establishment views never make it to prime time - the little peeps get drowned out by the loud, constant barrage of propaganda, explicit and implicit.

		<div class="commentbody">All of this is off topic - I will post later on it; it responds to the - typically fruitless - discussion of religion here.  <BR> <BR>Hrant: <BR> <BR>&gt;In the US:  <BR>Rabbi: never ever never. <BR> <BR>Wrong. Seinfeld has had episodes ridiculing worthless unethical Rabbis. It is appropriate that a Jew should be the one to lampoon Rabbis. Unfortunately most Jews in the entertainment industry have been so energetically running away from Judaism that they don't have much of a clue about Rabbis, either good or bad ones.  <BR> <BR>&gt;Christianity gets the most flak <BR> <BR>Not quite on the mark. Christian clerics get ridiculed often, but rarely Christianity. In the US, as John says, Catholicism as a religion sometimes gets lambasted, but rarely either Protestantism or the basics of Christian faith. Such criticism is publicly out of bounds in a way that criticism of Catholicism is not.  <BR> <BR>John: <BR> <BR>&gt;These are valid questions and reasonable challenges with which Catholic apologetics should be willing to engage.  <BR> <BR>John, I agree with the 'should', but I rarely see acknowledgement of the existence of such serious, scholarly critiques as Maccoby's, much less reasoned responses to them.  <BR> <BR>Generally on religious issues people just get offended by criticism of their religion, and don't want to respond to it. The reaction here to your criticism of Mormonism here is the normal one. This reaction seems to me to be equally typical of Christians - and those of other faiths - generally.  <BR> <BR>What I see in the US are the airwaves and internet replete with Christians rather smugly preaching to everyone - especially Jews - the superior wisdom of Christianity. And those proselytizing don't acknowledge or respond to the long tradition of criticism of Christianity by Jews and atheists - and Muslims. <BR> <BR>&gt;I'm interested in seeing the limits of such investigations &ndash; as regards proof &ndash; acknowledged.  <BR>  <BR>The analysis of ancient historical documents and archeological evidence can never be as conclusive as proof in mathematics or empirical testing in science. However, some historical analysis can be pretty persuasive in explaining otherwise baffling evidence or puzzling texts. For example, I heard about Maccoby's book from an adult student of mine. He was a thoughtful religious seeker, and he was so impressed by the book's argument - an historical critique of the New Testament - that, after further inquiry, he abandoned Christianity. <BR> <BR>I deeply respect sincere Christians. But I wish more would be aware of how ill-informed Christian proselytizing looks to knowledgable non-Christians.  <BR> <BR>I would be happy if vigorous civil debate of religious issues - including of Catholic beliefs - were possible. So far as I can see discussion of religion usually just leads to hurt feelings and little else. I thus post sadly, against my better judgment.</div>

By its nature, it tends to be the most important thing in the life of a believer, and this is by and large a good thing. The trick &ndash; and I admit that it is sometimes difficult and that I often fail &ndash; is to disagree fundamentally with someone <i>and still treat him or her with decency.</i> If decency relied on our ignoring the most important things in each others' lives, how decent would that be? It might be easier to be nice if we ignored our differences, but if we were able to be good despite our differences, wouldn't that be worth more? <BR> <BR>I'm firmly convinced that almost all war and conflict is material in cause. Religion may help stir up passions and draw lines, but I think there have been very few genuinely religious conflicts. War is essentially material, and the purpose of war is material gain. The history of the 20th century demonstrates admirably that war does not need religion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Anything goes. <BR> <BR>Yeah, lighten up, Paul, Chris. People want to take a break from work for a few minutes and blather about whatever is on their minds. So long as they avoid personal insults or threats, it seems pretty harmless to me. <BR> <BR>Back to inspiration. Creativity in every field, whether in science or philosophy or the arts is a matter of problem-solving.  <BR> <BR>The inspiration comes partly in seeing and choosing new problems. Here a lot of the inspiration comes from looking at past work. The trick is to be both appreciative and critical - understanding the past without being bound by it. When you appreciate, you understand what the person was up to. When you are critical, you can see how they could have chosen another problem, or pulled off the solution better. More broadly, there is an historical understanding of traditions - how one effort influenced another where the turning points were. All this gives you an insight into what new paths you might explore.  <BR> <BR>An often ignored part of this in education is the need to keep fresh the goals that led you into the field in the first place. I think that spark should be nurtured always, for it is what makes you see things differently from others, and leads you to make a distinctive contribution.  <BR> <BR>An example of problem shoice is Nick's choice of the problem of producing a unicase, monowidth face; and he did multiple related solutions. In revivals, many people have tried to see what should stay the same and what should change for new ways of producing fonts and new way of printing.  <BR> <BR>Paul, you've seen some pleasures in an old type that others hadn't seen the the joy in. And Chris went for modernism and greater variety in letter forms. Hrant is obviously inspired by the problem of improving readability of text fonts.   <BR> <BR>All this is in seeing and choosing problems. I found in studying history of science the greatest originality is at this stage.  <BR> <BR>The other aspects are your imagination and talent in creating solutions. Imagination is the ability to come up with fresh solutions. Again an appreciative and critical eye is a help, but also a free spirit, seeing broad connections - even in religion! - and a treasuring of your own individuality.  <BR> <BR>Talent relates most specifically to the field of endeavor. In type, there is more than one talent at work, but certainly one is artistic, visual talent of doing beautiful curves. Another is in being able to visualize that complex geometry of how shapes will harmonize one with the other. Here talent help you come up with not just new and varied solutions, but good ones. Guys like Garamond, Bodoni, Zapf, Frutiger- they have the gift. <BR> <BR>One thing I find interesting is that it is rare that the greatest serif and sans serif fonts come from the same hand. Is there a different talent involved in each? Why is that?</div>

I just want &quot;truth in Advertising&quot;. <BR> <BR>&gt;One thing I find interesting is that it is rare that the greatest serif and sans serif fonts come from the same hand. Is there a different talent involved in each? Why is that?&lt; <BR>SEE, now that is great stuff.  Here William has made a very astute observation which may be part of the reason we have different inspirations and outcomes.  I would love to see more discussion on his point. I know I never see myself spending much time designing a traditional serif text face.  It has nothing to do with my opinion of such faces.  I love them and use them daily. Perhaps I think I cannot come close to a Garamond or simply that serif faces don't speak to me the need for a new one&ndash;but that is just me. I hope others will pursue them.  The Sans serif, to me, has much more growing to do and I see the questions it asks me and that inspires me to try to answer by designing more sans be they text or display. <BR> <BR>&gt;In type, there is more than one talent at work, but certainly one is artistic, visual talent of doing beautiful curves. Another is in being able to visualize that complex geometry of how shapes will harmonize one with the other. &lt; <BR>Bravo William, another salient point, right on the mark. Throw communication into that mix too.  <BR>There is science, there is art, there is craft, and there is whimsy.  All are involved in type design and what motivates us individually. Thank heavens we all take a different avenue to the truth of form. What an unproductive traffic jam we would make if we all chose one single narrow path. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it is difficult to avoid religion when someone mentions Deseret, but I apologise if my particular response derailed the thread. But I think despite the intrusion there have been interesting responses to the original question all along, and personally I find it interesting to look back over the thread and see the interplay of ideas, between inspiration and religion, that contributors may not have been conscious of. I spoke about the palpable strangeness of the experience of inspiration: the expectation of creativity, that inspiration would arrive or that it could be in some sense commanded. I don't think this experience is so very far removed from the religious impulse. <BR> <BR>Jean-Fran</div>

		<div class="commentbody">re: lighten up. i guess making acid remarks with biblical references when the topic turns to religion is my way of making a dry, sarcastic joke. sorry if no one go the humor in that. <BR> <BR>however i think your post, william, got to the heart of what i was asking for in the first place, ie nick finding inspiration in problemsolving. nick with unicase designs, hrant with his bent toward legibility. i'm aware of those designers' efforts in those areas, but i'm interested in hearing about other problems that others are solving or other sources that serve for inspiration for others. if i had made it to typecon, this is probably a question i would have asked personally in individual conversations&hellip; but i didn't make it this year, so i figgered this was the next best &quot;forum&quot; to ask such questions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mr. Hrant Papazian, why do you letrasetly said <BR>that faith is not transferable? :-) <BR> <BR>I also think that we are children of circumstance <BR>and our pasts, but either I believe that what lasts <BR>is the name, both for men and the cities, and that <BR>only the love &amp; the death change all the things. <BR> <BR>The hour passes. <BR>The sorrow turns into oblivion. <BR>The work remain. <BR> <BR>Right now, like Mr. John Hudson and many others, <BR>I am inspired by the design brief, <BR>I am designing a font for Mulino Bianco: <BR><a href="http://www.capriflavors.com/mulino_bianco.php" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.capriflavors.com/mulino_bianco.php">http://www.capriflavors.com/mulino_bianco.php</a></a> <BR> <BR>Mr. William Berkson, maybe it is rare that <BR>the greatest serif and sans serif fonts come <BR>from the same hand because typefaces develope <BR>by families and type design history is huge <BR>as well as the history of philosophy. <BR> <BR>Mr. Chir Lozos, <em>yeah</em> &quot;thank heavens we all take <BR>a different avenue to the truth of form.&quot; <BR> <BR>Mr. Jean F Porchez, your &quot;typefaces are small piece <BR>of a much larger puzzle that I call communication&quot; <BR>is a beautiful enunciation but the &quot;small&quot; should <BR>be dropped, for the sake of heaven, which is maybe <BR>&quot;the roof for the thoughts,&quot; <BR>&quot;le toit qui abrite nos pense</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay this topic is almost all off-topic, but it seems to work someway. <BR>I use Alessandro's brilliant wrap-up: <BR>&quot;Mr. Hrant Papazian, why do you Letrasetly said  <BR>that faith is not transferable? :-)&quot; <BR> <BR>Try to overlap US character Jerry Falwell to Mother Theresa of Calcutta. Both &quot;catholic&quot;, then, spot the difference. <BR>What's universal (catholic) is always transferable. <BR>Like my beloved Letraset sheets (from which my own inspiration came when I was 16, almost 20 years ago). <BR>Live your faith in love instead of talking about it. It's such a simple thing. That's why it's otherwordly difficult. You can't do it alone. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the end I may say that I find very inspiring when I design, to clash together parts in conflict and end up with an improvement. <BR> <BR>All the tension behind many of my old typefaces came from the idea of dealing with inner (and outer) conflicts. Now that I've found a relative calm, I see better how you the user and the possible readers come first. As a letter and type designer, no matter the kind of face you're working on, you must consider this, even when expressing something very personal. Quality is not just a commodity.</div>
