body: "What's the better way to put regional variations of characters in a font? I
  ask because sometimes there's stuff that is not part of an standardized glyph shape
  \u2014like the different forms for the Eng in Sami and African languages\u2014 but
  just some kind of stylization that may look unfamiliar or incorrect to people that
  don't speak that language. As an Spanish speaker, I've seen that half of the time
  the tilde over the N is simplified in a macron, and there's some weird variations
  sometimes. There's no problem because the macron isn't used in the language and
  the fact that there's a bar over the N is enough to identify it. The same happens
  with other languages, which may use the same stylization over a letter that in another
  language may feel awkward or confusing.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ntilde_5744.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  same with some stylized version of the greek characters I have seen in some fonts,
  which even if logical may look odd for people that is not too used to them.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/greek_4555.png]"

  body: "Perhaps not in text fonts but in display fonts, there seems to be a lot of
    tolerance for screwing around with accents. Take a risk. If anyone's confused,
    they can contact you and you can change the accents in the next version. What
    would be useful is a Flickr pool of wacky accents so font designers can get a
    feel for how far they can be pushed.\r\n\r\nThere are no languages in which a
    macron and a tilde need to be differentiated, so go nuts."
