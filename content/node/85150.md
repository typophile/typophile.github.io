  body: The <a href="http://www.fontlab.us/downloads/manuals/FG51_Manual4Online.zip">Fontographer
    5 Manual</a> has a chapter "Using a text editor to tweak Fontographer 5 on your
    Macintosh" / "Adding custom encodings" (pp 395ff) which describes it; obviously
    it relies on .enc files as FLS5 does.
