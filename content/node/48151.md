  We're trying to use it on a website as an alternative to Univers Light Condensed.
  \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how available it is? Is it a standard on most computers
  and browsers? Any information would help.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    87.46% \r\nMac: 91.26%\r\n\r\nBut i would be careful, because there is no \"standard
    system font\" which can replace \"Arial Narrow\", your css-layout could \u2026
    explode\r\n\r\n<code>font-family:\"Arial Narrow\", Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;</code>\r\nThat
    means if Arial Narrow is not installed on the system, it will be replaced be the
    wider Arial or Helvetica and so on.\r\n\r\nThere is a possibility to work with
    sIFR (google it), a Flash/Javascript \"solution\", but the more dynamic it gets,
    the more difficult it gets too. You can see sIFR in use here on typophile \u2013
    the headlines are dynamically rendered in the \"featured face\". \r\n\r\nI would
    ask me, is it worth the money i have to pay for a proper technical solution. Or
    isn't it better to avoid \"Arial Narrow\" with another design concept.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck\r\n\r\n\t\r\n "
