    TrueType is nothing else but OpenType TT, so the only difference between those
    formats is hinting, which is actually *more* complicated in TrueType-flavored
    fonts than in PostScript-flavored fonts. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Sorry twardoch,\r\n\r\nI think I meant the learning curve in OpenType and
    applying features.\r\n\r\nI'm still try to get my head all around this.\r\nWith
    terminology that uses half another file's terminology it confuses me.\r\n(OpenType
    PS, OpenType TT, TrueType, Windows TrueType, TrueType flavored OpenType, PostScript-Flavored
    OpenType.......Oh come on!!)\r\n\r\nI'm trying hard to learn as much as I can
    but in the world of Typography I keep getting this feeling that the ones who made
    the rules <strong>call</strong>...\r\n<strong>a car a car \r\na horse a horse\r\na
    car, sometimes a horse \r\na horse, sometimes a car\r\na horse that can be a car
    when it feels like it\r\na car that can be a PC but can't be a Mac\r\na Roman
    horse that uses only three legs to be OS X horse\r\na car that has 1252 buttons
    but won't run on Mac OS 8/9 fuel\r\na car that is eaten by a horse...a car\r\nand
    then there is a horse flavored like a Ford!</strong>\r\n<strong><em>And that's
    at it friendliest to newbies.</em></strong> \r\n\r\nIs Font terminology really
    a secret society of confusion, or will my brain eventually surrender, and I talk
    and walk like you guys?. lol\r\n\r\nThanks for answering. I'm already aware of
    the presence of many gurus here and I really appreciate every learned comment.\r\nI
    love this site. So much to learn.\r\n\r\nNow anyone have an answer on CacheTT?\r\n\r\nCheers

  body: "Believe me, I've been campaigning for unified terminology on this since at
    least 2002. This is the cheat sheet:\r\n\r\nOpenType TT (.ttf) = TrueType-flavored
    OpenType = OpenType TTF = Windows TrueType\r\n\r\nOpenType PS (.otf) = PostScript-flavored
    OpenType = OpenType CFF\r\n\r\nAs for OpenType features, there is also no real
    difference. If your font just has glyphs that are default representations of Unicode
    characters, then you don't need any OpenType Layout features, no matter whether
    you make .otf or .ttf (FontLab Studio will build the kerning feature automatically).
    \r\n\r\nIf your font does have any alternate glyphs or ligatures, then you should
    add OpenType Layout code, no matter whether you make .otf or .ttf.\r\n\r\nIn my
    own experience, making .otf is much simpler than making .ttf because you don't
    need to worry about the hinting issues. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    to worry about hinting or not, can be made without leaving the ttf format. \r\nThe
    decision made to worry about contour conversion or not, can only be made without
    entering the ttf format.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Thanks twardoch and dberlow.\r\nAnd I'm cut & pasting your cheat note too!
    \ ;-)\r\n\r\nAs a just fallen to earth font newbie myself, I think the major problem
    is that I want the terminology to be distinct, not bleed into one, which is part
    of one description, not another and sometimes all at once.\r\nI'd love A to be
    a file format and description, B to be another and C to be another.\r\nI just
    don't find the file format descriptions separate enough.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to
    get it slowly.\r\nBut then I look at two files sitting in a folder and from outside
    I see one icon has TT on it and the other has an O on it. Touch on the files,
    look at the Properties, and both are described as Truetype.\r\nWhy not have one
    icon on the file? Or have the Properties describe the files as different based
    on there being different icons? Why have the O on the file if the file format
    descriptions are the same? \r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks again.\r\n\r\nCould someone
    please describe 'hinting' to me in layman's terms.\r\nI've read lots here and
    in manuals, and have read that is the dread of most type designers.\r\nHow would
    you describe it to a Graphic Designer? (Not an already Type Design aware person)\r\n\r\nCheers "

  body: "Hinting is, in simple terms, a way to tell the computer that certain parts
    of letters should be kept equal at small sizes even if those parts are in reality
    not identical. For example, all stems in small sizes should either be one pixel
    wide or two pixels wide, but if some stems are one pixel wide and some stems that
    in reality are only slightly thicker are then suddenly two pixels wide, it looks
    horrible. So hinting is a mechanism to regularize the display of a font in small
    sizes. \r\n\r\nThe icon thing is confusing, but regardless of whether a font has
    an OpenType icon or a TrueType icon in Windows, it actually always is OpenType.
    OpenType PS fonts always get the O icon while OpenType TT fonts that have a digital
    signature get the O icon and those which don't have a digital signature get the
    TT icon. The presence or absence of a digital signature has no influence on any
    actual \"OpenType functionality\" though. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: In answer to the original question, yes, we're still using CacheTT to calculate
    device metrics tables in a way that Windows likes. FontLab for Windows includes
    an option to utilise CacheTT during TTF generation, and I recommend this, if for
    no other reason than that it makes Font Validator reports a lot shorter.
