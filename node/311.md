  I want a light, regular, bold, and heavy. <BR> <BR>In looking through the FontLab
  pdf manual I got this idea: If I draw up the heavy version  <BR>next, taking care

  version I have to create a multiple master for the bold? From there, I could  <BR>extrapolate
  to the light version. I imagine it will take some tweeking to get these intermediate  <BR>weights
  the way I want them.  <BR> <BR>My questions are these: <BR>How hard is it to set
  up a mulitple master from two weights? How much tweaking is  <BR>neccessary? Will
  this save time, or cause more of a headache? Does this make any  <BR>sense at all?

  body: 'You&#39;ll get different answers about the &#34;right way&#34;, but to me
    best compromise is what I did in Patria: <BR> <BR>1&#41; Assuming you have a non-extreme
    weight at hand, use the software&#39;s &#34;weight change&#34; to make the light
    and dark extremes. Confine to the x-axis. <BR>2&#41; Tweak like there&#39;s no
    tomorrow, specifically by decreasing the contrast in the light extreme while increasing
    it in the dark. But you should also adjust the overshoots: the lighter the greater.
    <BR>3&#41; Create a new intermediate of where you started, and compare it to your
    original. Assuming you still like your original better, tweak the two extremes
    &#40;not the resultant intermediate&#41; to get back to where your original was.
    <BR>4&#41; Once you end up with extremes that you like, and they generate your
    original intermediate weight to your liking, you&#39;re done. You shouldn&#39;t
    have to tweak any intermediates at all. In general.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Two words
    of caution: <BR>1&#41; Very light weights reveal problems in stroke thickness
    very obviously. <BR>2&#41; Very dark weights can get too pudgy. It takes a lot
    of expertise to put the sparkle in them - few people can manage - I for one can&#39;t.
    Look at the darkest weights of Galliard for guidance there. <BR> <BR>BTW, you
    don&#39;t have to make an actual MM font - in fact most users would have trouble
    with that! Just have your axis &#34;internal&#34; to your font app, and generate
    the necessary intermediate weights. Four weights is a good number - too many weights
    and some users can get confused. If you have very light and dark weights, go to
    6. <BR> <BR>Spacing the weight gradation is   v e r y   t r i c k y ...  and very
    open to personal preference. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Randy - <BR> <BR>As Eduardo and Hrant have pointed out, there really isn&#39;t
    a correct way to do this. Maybe try it both ways on a few glyphs and compare the
    results. It could be a nice experiment. I prefer Eduardo&#39;s approach. I draw
    one extreme and then paste it into the mask layer in FL 4.5 and use it as a reference
    for drawing the other extreme weight.

  body: FontLab 4.5 ships with a demo Python script called &#39;Family Generator&#39;,
    which automatically produces a Light, Bold and Heavy design from a Regular. Of
    course, the results are never perfect and always require manual editing to clean
    them up, but depending on your design this can be surprisingly effective as a
    first step. The other thing to realise, of course, is that you can <i>edit the
    Python script</i>, and so tailor the weight and width adjustments made by the
    script to your design.

  body: i think kyle is absolutely right. forget multiple master, it&#39;s hardly
    breathing anymore. <BR> <BR>there probably isn&#39;t a correct way and it usually
    depends on the kind of design you&#39;re working on. i personally have found it
    to be efficient to work both ways at the same time. you can use the &#34;change
    weight comand - resize to x-height&#34; as a sort of reference and also to get
    your accents, punctuation etc. you still have to tweak those, but it&#39;s less
    of a hassle then also tweaking all the main letters from that. those you should
    definately draw manually. <BR> <BR>it also helps layering all weights of one character
    atop of each other and optimizing the &#34;new&#34; weights right there in one
    window in comparisson with your finished regular weight.

  body: Multiple master fonts never were a big hit commercially. I&#39;ve got about
    three dozen of them and I think that was about how many were made.  <BR> <BR>But,
    they do work well on pre-OS X systems and, quite frankly, will for quite some
    time. OS X didn&#39;t exactly come out during the best of economic times and it
    still hasn&#39;t pulled over the &#34;majority&#34; of folks, or so the reports
    from MacWorld indicate. <BR> <BR>Problem with Multiple Masters was that they were
    &#149;&#149;&#149;-backwards. Works better to extrapolate from the medium point
    not interpolate from the end points. Like QuickDraw GX did back in 1994. <BR>
    <BR>Still waiting, and waiting for OpenType to look spectacular. Starting to look
    like just another format isn&#39;t it? <BR> <BR>

  body: One should consider that multiple master can be used as a design tool, without
    ever generating multiple master fonts in the end. Most recent Adobe fonts were
    designed in MM space, without ever being built as MMs. <BR> <BR>Personally, I
    would add a weight axis to the regular, design the black weight, extrapolate the
    light weight, set it as the new master at the light end, and then clean it up.
    <BR> <BR>One good piece of advice Robert Slimbach gave me on the family I&#39;m
    working on right now was that designing the extreme masters and interpolating
    really helps the intermediate weights come out better. It forces you to fix things
    in the extreme masters that might not be so noticeable in intermediate weights.

    maybe not the first time you do it&#41;. Plenty of very nice typefaces have been
    developed this way, including most of Robert Slimbach&#39;s designs. <BR> <BR>There
    are cases where you wouldn&#39;t want to do it this way, or where you&#39;d use

    was 4 years ago, so I&#39;ll have to fudge the  <BR>details. But in essence the
    method is to start with the  <BR>regular weight, then manually design the extremes
    &#40;the  <BR>widest black and the narrowest thin&#41;. Then have the  <BR>software
    create the basis for the intermediate weights. &#40;If   <BR>my memory is correct,
    the software would&#39;ve generated 3  <BR>weights of Champion.&#41; Then of course,
    there is a lot of  <BR>cleanup work to do to add some human care/finesse to the  <BR>intermediate
    weights. <BR> <BR>In other words, the computer can help take some of the  <BR>tedium

    just design elegance, it&#39;s practicality: if you change your mind about what
