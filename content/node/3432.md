  body: They really do don&#39;t they colin. <BR> <BR>Dalton Maag are favourites of
    mine. Their custom typeface work is the nuts. Always so well executed. I hear
    Iris also collaborate with DM. <BR> <BR>On a side-note I spotted some stock photography
    that I recognise on the telewest site. What a sad predicament.
