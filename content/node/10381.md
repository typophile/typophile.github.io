  for a better view. <BR> <BR>I like the bars on the t, f and A. More like that &#40;the
  H would be an obvious candidate&#41;!  <BR>The Q&#39;s tail is pretty spiffy as
  well. <BR>Perhaps consider having more variety among the UC serifs. <BR> <BR>--Eric

  body: ' Uhm.. Nice work. <BR> <BR>Just out of curiousity..how many hours &#40;approx.&#41;
    have you used on this face so far? <BR> <BR>Uhm.. The tail on the uppercase &#39;Q&#39;
    are not right.. I would have tried to make it less angular and softer... The lowercase
    &#39;e&#39; also bugs me...the horisontal bar should be lowered to balance the
    negative space above and under it.  <BR> <BR>Its obviously a lot of stuff that
    can be discussed about a typeface that is so close to being finished &#40;relatively
    speaking&#41; ..but I am allways a bit reluctant as to suggest alterations that
    may take some personality away from it at this stage. <BR> <BR>I am not sure of
    what youve been thinking with your &#34;experimental&#34; ligatures in the copy
    you set. Its not working at the moment but its definately something to look into..But
    the question is if it is the right typeface to do it with. <BR> <BR>It sure looks
    promising!! Go on! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
