    be included in this book? Is it open to anyone who has ever designed a logo at
    any point in time?

  body: "Not to just bump this spamvertised thread, here is a nice little story about
    Pedro Guitton, 'Index Book' and their 'ethics' of borrowing elements from existing
    logos they published in previous books.\r\n\r\nIll try to make this as short as
    possible, but this may be quite interesting, for some.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 / 2003 I
    designed a logo for a local restaurant, named 'benito'.\r\n<em>( http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/4571/benito1ki.gif
    )</em>\r\n\r\nIn 2004 I have been asked by Andres Fredes / Juland, if I would
    be interested in getting some of my works published in an upcoming book project,
    'Around Europe Logos', released by 'Index Book', Barcelona. I was quite honored,
    back then, getting invited for this, so I submitted a few of my works, including
    the 'benito' logo. The book gets published, the 'benito' mark is in. Fine.\r\n\r\nEarlier
    this week I get another invitation to submit works for an upcoming 'Index Book'
    release. This time coordinated by Pedro Guitton. I then take a look at his site
    and portfolio, and notice the following logo, he 'designed' for 'Burro Catalan',
    in 2005, according to his site.\r\n<em>( http://img467.imageshack.us/img467/767/burrocatalan6yr.gif
    )\r\n( Source of the 'Burro Catalan' sample image: http://www.pedroguitton.com/mito_3_portfolio_46.htm
    )</em>\r\n\r\nI have yet to find out what exactly is the relation between the
    author of the book I actually submitted logos to, back then, Andres Fredes; The
    publisher 'Index Book' who then had high resolution, printable versions of the
    logos; And Pedro Guitton who evidently, shamelessly 'borrowed' elements from my
    'benito' logo.\r\n\r\nOf course I contacted Pedro Guitton, and the publisher 'Index
    Book' as well, to ask them about this. This is what Mr. Guitton responded:\r\n<em>'for
    my part it\xB4s a complete coincidence...'\r\n'believed or not i have my mind
    clear and i\xB4m a really creative person\r\nhave a good one !'</em>\r\n\r\n(
    I have yet to get any response from the publisher itself. )\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: David, that is most certainly lifted from your design. It's not "similar"
    or "inspired by" but an exact copy. Thanks for the heads-up. Paul, you've done
    quite an impressive body of work there... :)
