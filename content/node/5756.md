body: I&#39;m wondering if there are any &#34;classic&#34; pixel fonts out there,
  meaning a pixel font that is tried and true like Helvetica and Univers are.

    and <a href="http://www.kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/index.html">Silkscreen</a>
    by Michael Kottke are considered tried and true by many. '

  body: But if you want something that has U&amp;lc, and suitable for body text and
    not just for navigation or captions, check out <a href="http://www.wpdfd.com">MiniHaha</a>,
    the sister &#40;or descendent?&#41; of Mini 7. We&#39;re using that on <a href="http://www.typophile.com/">our
    home page</a> right now. The two faces work brilliantly together. Well worth the
    equally mini price tag.

  body: What about Verdana?  It seems to be about as ubiquitous as Helvetica these
    days. <BR> <BR>Also, the designer of Silkscreen is named Jason Kottke, not Michael.

    a free one from <a href="http://www.fountain.nu">Fountain.</a> <BR>It&#39;s a
    good variation on Mini 7 and includes regular,  <BR>serif and unicase styles.
    <BR> <BR>This one includes vector outlines that emulate the  <BR>bitmap &#40;i.e.
    it&#39;s Flash compatible&#41;.

    of years ago. <BR>Although I guess those were actually &#34;lettering&#34;. <BR>

  body: And cross stitching... <BR> <BR>Speaking on &#34;first pixel fonts, I own
    two embroidery books, containing more of 200 full square flavored alphabets, most
    of them are very &#34;enlightened&#34; with more of 30 pixels x-height, but the
    small sizes, 7, 9, 10, 12, are very similar to our contemporanean screen fonts
    &#40;Silkscreen and others&#41; <BR>They all came from the &#34;Sajou&#34;, &#34;Rouyer&#34;
    and &#34;Alexandre&#34; embroidery booklets, from 1940/50 I think. <BR> <BR>By
    the way, my favorite classic pixel font is Georgia in small sizes.

    are allowed, these are among the oldest ones, ever: http://typophile.com/node/57604\r\nPublished

    that's befitting.)"
