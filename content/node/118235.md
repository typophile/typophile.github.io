    the middle point of the W is short and flat--rare to find the mix in one face.\r\n\r\nFF
    Fago Monospaced is close, but the Y has a bar at the baseline and the sides of
    the M are flared. \r\n\r\nAs for Whatthefont and Whatfontis, they only work if
    the font is widely and commercially available (i.e., in those sites' respective
    databases), the sample is pristine, and the font has a lot of distinctive characteristics.
    Thankfully, there are people on this forum (not me) who have their finger on the
    typographic pulse, and one of them is bound to recognize it. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime,
    I will keep plodding away...."

  body: Thanks, kthomps5! I came across FF Fago Monospaced too while looking for the
    font. I thought the same thing about MyFonts.com not having the font. Maybe is
    new, DK. Thanks for your help.

    Your sample is very big and very clean. How did you get such an excellent sample?
    Is this from PDF? Because if it is, try inspecting its properties, font might
    be embedded... And if not, would you provide more information about this sample
    like origin, website...? "

    good except /W vertical angle. Still searching but probably custom...

  body: "Thanks, Ryuk! It's from a PDF, didn't know you can do that with a PDF! And
    yes, the font is JB Heureka -JB Heureka OT, actually. I went through Johannes
    Breyer website and he doesn't have the fonts to purchase neither and it seems
    that the typeface is very difficult to find online too. I dont know if anyone
    knows where I can find it.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help, akira1975 too! It's from
    the new redesign of NYLON, indeed!\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who helped here!"

  body: 'To me that''s definitely not Heureka or at least that''s not the same version
    as seen on Heureka samples... Too many differences: /Q tail, /J top, /S shape...
    The list is too long actually. How could you state it is Heureka? Your PDF embeds
    it? So that''s probably a newer version, refined for Nylon Magazine. Would love
    having a look as well so if you mind sharing your PDF with us, that would be great!
    And asking directly Johannes Breyer looks like the only option you have to acquire
    JB Heureka but probably only the older version than Nylon''s.'

    body: '@Ryuk, the PDF embeds it as ''JB Heureka OT'' not as only ''JB Heureka''.
      Maybe it''s another variation of the family or, as you said, a custom version
      for NYLON. They also use DIN but condensed, not a monospace. I thought this
      Heureka was a monospace but it seems like it''s not. Here you can download a
      PDF version of the magazine. http://longfiles.com/zu9wbf5vitap/NYLON-June-July-2014.pdf.html'
