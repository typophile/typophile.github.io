    more Bodoni but still not finding it yet.\r\n\r\nOOH maybe Bulmer... or close
    to it (a redraw?)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bulmer-mt/\r\n\r\nno...
    I'm back to Bodoni, but can't find a match yet. Bodoni Twelve, Bodoni Seventytwo
    and Bauer Bodoni are close but there are differences..."
