		<div class="commentbody">Hopefully you will get some Israeli comment, but it really depends on the purpose to which the font will be put. I am not expert on this, but here is what I know. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Israelis generally don't use the points or 'nikud', though they will use the 'additional' punctuation, hash marks which are attached to Hebrew letters to indicate the soft g and ch sounds in foreign names (Charlie, George). But once in a while Israelis will throw in a vowel point to resolve ambiguity, so probably it is best to have the full set of vowels.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The cantillation marks are only for the editions of the Bible used as a guide for chanting the text - a very specialized use.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Yiddish combinations are not required in regular Hebrew [Yiddish is a German dialect written in Hebrew characters]. Yiddish is still alive, but has few speakers; you can get a keyboard mapping just for Yiddish which uses the combination letters, I believe.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For outside Israel you would definitely need the regular vowel points, but for inside you might get away without, though you'd have to ask Israelis. I would guess that few Hebrew fonts have cantillation marks available.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is a problem with spacing the vowel points in a fully voweled text. Some of the Hebrew composition programs for use outside Israel advertise that they have special software to deal with this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are basically four typical ways to write Hebrew today (I say 'typical' because one sometimes finds partially vocalised texts that include occasional nikud): <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1. Totally unmarked: letters only. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2. Only consonant markers indicated: shin dot U+05C1; sin dot U+05C2; dagesh U+05BC; rafe U+05BF. Note that not all consonant marks may be used, or may be used only when necessary to distinguish ambiguous words. For example, one might see documents that only mark the sin dot. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->3. Full vocalisation: all nikud (vowels) and consonant markers as above. Most of the nikud are centered under the consonant or, in the case of the right-leg consonants like dalet and resh, under the right side. An important exception is the holam, which sits at the top left of the consonant in most cases. Note that the position and behaviour of holam varies in modern Hebrew and many Bible editions. In modern Hebrew typesetting the holam sits slightly to the left of the letter, between it and the next letter. In many Bible editions the holam sits above the left edge of the letter but, importantly, may contextually move further to the left in some circumstances, e.g. when followed by an unvocalised alef. The OTL lookups for Biblical holam are a pain in the neck. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->4. Full vocalisation and accentuation: all nikud and consonant markers plus all te'amin (cantillation marks). This is used only for the Biblical text; to my knowledge, te'amin never occur in any text except the Bible. Te'amin interract contextually with the nikud and with each other and this, among other things, drastically slows the rendering time of a Biblical Hebrew font. Although many Hebrew-speakers will tell you there is no significant difference between the Biblical and modern Hebrew language, there are some typographic difference (e.g. the position of holam mentioned above) and I'm inclined to ship a stripped-down version of my Biblical Hebrew font for modern Hebrew users simply so they will have something that doesn't have to go through dozens of OTL lookups for things they don't need like te'amin interraction. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In addition to the consonant markers, nikud and te'amin, there are a few odds and ends in the Unicode Hebrew block. The paseq mark (U+05C0) is used as part of accentuation in the Biblical text, but it also appears in the Microsoft 8-bit Hebrew codepage, which suggests that it might have some use in modern Hebrew. The Yiddish digraphs that William mentioned may be encoded using the precomposed characters or sequences of regular Hebrew letters; I understand that there is actually divergent practice between different Yiddish user communities. Also, some of the precomposed alef+nikud combinations in the Unicode Alphabetic Presenation Forms block are used as vowels in Yiddish, so should probably be included in any font intended to support that language, even though they may be encoded as sequences of letter and mark. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Modern Hebrew punctuation uses most of the typical Latin set: comma, period, semicolon, etc. including parentheses, brackets and braces. I'm not 100% sure what the standard for quotation marks is. Note that unlike Arabic, Hebrew does not use a horizontally-flipped, right-to-left question mark; I know one Israeli type designer who thinks they should, but he has not convinced his colleagues or typical users. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My recommendation is that a font for modern Hebrew should support everything that is in the Microsoft 1255 Hebrew codepage.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I believe John's post has cleared up the matter almost fully, so I would simply like to answer Hrant's query from an Israeli point of view. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nikud (vocalization marks) is indeed rare in modern Hebrew, therefore fonts that that are not considered to be &quot;text&quot; faces, meaning they would not accomodate long passages of text, usually include the Hebrew letters only (05D0-05EA), no Nikud. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A good Hebrew text face, though, has a full set of Nikud (starting 05B0) as well as the letters. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think new Hebrew foundries (like Oded Ezer's) add Nikud to almost all their faces, both text and display - a blessed habit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Yiddish vowel pairs double-Vav, Vav-Yod and Double-Yod (05F0-05F2) are rarely included. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Quotation marks are almost always &quot;typewriter&quot; style (05F3-05F4) and should be included in all Hebrew faces (there is very wide use of them, especially since the Geresh ' mark is used as an abbriviation mark for the likes of Prof. and Capt. and the Gershayim &quot; is used for the likes of Dr and Mr). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The hebrew hyphen used for word-connection is called Maqaf (05BE) and should also be included with every Hebrew font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sof pasuq (05C3) is literally a colon (it's used in bibilical publications to note where verses end), it can be a direct link to the colon glyph. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Rafe (05BF) and Paseq (05C0) aren't normally used in everyday Hebrew. Also, I have no idea what the Upper Dot (05C4) means, maybe it's a version of the Holam (05B9) mark? (John? William? Anyone?) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you add Nikud to a Hebrew font, you should also add the Hebrew portion of the Alphabetic Presentation Forms table (the wide letters and the Yiddish and Ladino ligatures are only an option, though). Notice there's also a special Jewish &quot;plus&quot; sign for Hebrew (to counter the &quot;christian&quot;, cross-like plus). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Basic punctuation like commas, periods, and exclamation and question marks are generally the same as in Latin faces. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some classic designs favor the shape of a diamond for the periods and other points, but I think you have that in some English faces as well, don't you? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm curious as to the identity of the Israeli type designer who thinks Hebrew should use Arabic question marks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Former prime minister, Yitzhak Ben-Tzvi once motioned to add two Hebrew letters (Alef-like and He-like) to replace vocalization marks.

I'd originally guessed that U+05C4 was the Hebrew number mark, but it is actually intended as the upper <!-- raw HTML omitted -->punctum extraordinarium<!-- raw HTML omitted --> &ndash; sorry, I don't know what the Jewish name is &ndash; which appears only in the Biblical text and only a very small number of times. Scholars disagree about its meaning, but it is clearly very important because it even occurs in some Torah scrolls, which do not include nikud or te'amin (excuse my Aramaic: it's what I'm used to). There is also a lower punctum, which occurs only three times in the Bible text, all on one word, in Psalm 27:13, but the Israeli standards body didn't bother to propose this for encoding because it was so rare. I'm not sure what they thought scholars were supposed to do without it! It has now been proposed for addition to the Unicode Hebrew block (along with the almost equally rare <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nun hafukah<!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Here is an image of the first word in the 13th verse of Psalm 27. The large dots above and below are the puncta; the form shown for U+05C4 in the Unicode book is misleading. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you add Nikud to a Hebrew font, you should also add the Hebrew portion of the Alphabetic Presentation Forms table (the wide letters and the Yiddish and Ladino ligatures are only an option, though). Notice there's also a special Jewish &quot;plus&quot; sign for Hebrew (to counter the &quot;christian&quot;, cross-like plus).<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The alphabetic presentation forms also include the alef-lamed ligature. This is not used for the Biblical text*, but is sometimes encountered in other religious books such prayer books, and in a variety of other Hebrew texts from the 7th century on (the earliest dated manuscript containing this ligature was found in the Cairo Genizah; sorry, I can't remember the date). I recently did some research on this ligature, and discovered its early history as record by Solomon Birnbaum in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Hebrew Scripts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, Brill 1971, p.226. It originated among speakers of Judaeo-Arabic following the Moslem conquests. The sequence alef+lamed is incredibly common in Arabic because it is the definite article <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'al<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and the ligature was originally developed specifically to write this word. It's use was later extended to every occurence of the sequence in Judaeo-Arabic, and gradually found its way into use in Hebrew. I'd be interested to know to what extent it is used in modern Israel and in what kinds of texts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* Although the alef-lamed ligature is not normally used for the Biblical text, whether in scroll or book form, Moses Gaster notes that one book manuscript in his collection does include 'ligatures formed by the joining of two letters', which I'm guessing refers to the alef-lamed ligature. This is part of a discussion of the relative liberality shown in the writing of Bibles (books) as opposed to the sacred Torah scrolls.

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Meir, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I just realized I used to download some of your early latin &quot;experiments&quot; when you were a teenager. Tfu Tfu was one of my favorites (I love cats), and knowing such a blackletter &quot;revisitation&quot; comes from Israel is just delightful. Your comments on MTV and timelessness are enlightening. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm currently reading a book about the exoteric facet of Nazism (and the SS Ahnenerbe) which ties in with my work-in-progress on Nazist imagery in a modern context. I'll surely write you in the future. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On a slightly different matter (here the audience seems in tune), the last issue of Eye magazine (n.50) includes a fantastic article by Paul Khera on Abbar, an amazing Arabic typeface which attempts, for the first time as far as I know, to detach itself from the dominating and pretty abused calligraphic models, without forgetting them. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The experiments Huda Abifares did with her students in 2002 were more display-oriented, and the work of synthesis Yassar Abbar has done feels really &quot;ahead&quot; in the text-setting field.</div>

It's interesting, though, to see how the local folk of each culture take those incredibly imperialistic elements and make them their own.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Fontbit&rsquo;s text fonts indeed do include full nikud with correct Opentype positioning (providing the software supports it, ie Word, and the Adobe suite to-date).</p>
<p>Masterfont has now the technology (read the programmer) to do nikud correctly and is currently converting all the fonts to have correct nikud placement.</p>
<p>Fontbit has two fonts with teamim inside, Livorna and Hadassa, however, the problem of collisions cannot be solved within the font in a sensible way (although Adobe seems to think it can) and has to be solved by an external script. I have solved this problem with both Livorna and Hadassa and have successfully typeset perfectly positioned biblical texts in Adobe InDesign.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I found Abbar's work to be problematic (and not nearly as original as it seems), and Khera's article superficial. The main problem with Abbar's font is that it matches the vertical proportions of Univers. As if Univers weren't inappropriate for a lot of text to begin with, Arabic adapted to those proportions can only be a display face, and a servile one. True typographic harmony isn't so shallow. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; &quot;Westernization&quot; of semitic typefaces is inevitable <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't be so pessimistic.

		<div class="commentbody">Some of the most creative advances in civilization have come from culture clash - or so argued my late teacher Karl Popper in 'The Open Society and Its Enemies'.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, some of the most stupid and ugly things can also come of cultural clash! So the issue is not whether there is influence, but how creatively it is done. Do you get something new and good, or worse or just ridiculous?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the case of Hebrew script, it was already 'Easternized' once. The 'Hebrew' characters are not Hebrew at all, but Aramaic. In the Talmud I believe they are called 'Chaldean'. The ancient Hebrew script was gradually replaced by the Aramaic script after the Babylonian exile in the fifth century B.C.E. [Aramaic was the language of Babylon and became the common language of the whole near east.]  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, Meir, do they ever use the ancient Hebrew script on stamps or coins today in Israel?</div>
