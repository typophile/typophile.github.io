body: "In designing custom typographic brandmarks I always wonder how other designers
  approach the choice of companion fonts for letterhead and business card. Do you
  have hard and fast rules? If the brandmark is clearly based on a font do you try
  to match the companion type to it? If you contrast to the brandmark do you have
  a distinct philosophy for how you contrast your choice, or is it intuitive? \r\n\r\nAnd
  what do you do when the brandmark is its own child of the universe with no clear
  relationship to existing fonts? The majority of my work needs to be highly proprietary
  and so I usually create the logo without reference to typefaces. I find these situations
  the trickiest, and sometimes get pressure from a client to go with a conservative
  font-based option because they think it makes the job of choosing the letterhead
  fonts easier. How much thought do you give to how the custom typographic design
  will fit with typesetting--and does that concern modify your design process? My
  own choices are usually very intuitive, and based on a hard-to-codify aesthetic
  of color/weight/stylistic feel and usually more based on contrast than similarity."

  body: "Hi Spark, \r\n\r\nI'm not an expert on this, but I think that, a lot of viewer,
    sometimes user friendly font like Arial/ Helvetica or Times, etc... become invisible,
    people don't really pay much attention to it, even though they look at it everyday.
    For designer, they might notice it, and we all agree that those fonts are easy
    to read. Why?\r\n\r\nThere are million (i'm not sure with the number :) logos,
    logotypes, brandmarks, business card, letter head using the same typefaces, or
    similar typeface, but does any one notice it ? and most of it was designed based
    on aesthetic/ memorable of color/ weight/ style/ to attract the viewers. I still
    don't know why?\r\n\r\nFor Type Design, I think each designer has their own design
    process, some might leaning more toward trendy user-friendly/ invisible typeface,
    other lean toward experimental, hard to read typeface and such ... Sometimes I
    wished we all use pictograph instead of using boring roman letter.\r\n\r\nLastly,
    if I work for a client, my choices will be depend on the most popular trend/ style
    that is out there because my intuitive tells me, that font is boring.\r\n\r\n:D"

  body: "Color and contrast.\r\n\r\nSame color or contrasting color (where color stands
    for the perceived grayness of the typeface). Same style or contrasting style (where
    style could be humanist sans serif). Etc.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: Interesting, but difficult. The choice all depends upon the project at hand
    and the end game in mind. I'd agree that it all comes down to intuition. And usually
    this does include wanting a specific amount of contrast (or lack thereof).
