  body: Back when ITC released their Bodoni, their <i>U&amp;lc</i> magazine ran a
    feature on what various type designers thought made a typeface &#39;timeless&#39;
    &#40;or was it &#39;classic&#39;&#41;. I recall that Carol Twombly mentioned that
    the golden section had a tendency to pop up all over many of the typefaces that
    we consider classic. An obvious place to start looking is in the proportion of
    x-height to ascender or cap height. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think Carol made it clear
    whether this frequent occurence of the golden section in type design was due to
    intention or simply to a good designer&#39;s natural feel for pleasing proportions.

    <BR>I don&#39;t know a stitch of Dutch, but I&#39;m guessing a rough translation
    would be &#34;The relation of the x-height to the ascenders in the Golden Mean.&#34;
    Which, upon measuring, indeed it is -- approximately 1.618. The relation to the
    descender is not quite f, being only 1.6. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>'
