  a complete novice), but I am attempting to replicate the font(s) attached. Can anyone
  recognise it/them? The sample below is from \"The Beast From 20 000 Fathoms\" trailer.
  Any help is much appreciated. I can provide more samples if necessary.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/50s

  body: "I love lettering like this & I'm trying to perfect the style myself. If you
    ever get hold of old sign painting books you'll find alphabets like this usually
    called \"Casual\" or sometimes \"Utility\". Red Rooster's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/portobello-rr/|Portobello]]
    is another close-ish one, especially the demi, bold & extra bold weights.\r\n\r\nI've
    just noticed Bello & Portobello. I presume there is a connection but what is the
    source?"
