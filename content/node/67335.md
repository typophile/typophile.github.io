  were modular shapes out of which you could build letters etc. A forerunner of Fontstruct,
  in a way.\r\nA web search found this:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/thearm/4348630485/in/pool-37718678610@N01\r\nHas
  anyone ever played with these?"

    the images.  Micah Currier at The Dale Guild Type Foundry cast these for The Cooper
    Union.  They are a heck of a lot of fun.  They are essentially letter fragments,
    but you can also use them to draw images.  We fonted a few extra sets to sell.
    \ You should see the zombie prints the Yee Haw guys have done with them!\r\n\r\nOur
    promo print linked above is by Yee Haw alumnus Brian C. Baker.\r\n\r\nDGM\r\nThe

    run across those (in an old set of large educational cards ATF made (50s?)) in
    the library on the very day you posted pics of yours on Flickr!"
