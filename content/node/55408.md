body: "I was doodling and came up with an ambigram for my name, Daniel.  It works
  pretty well, but of course there's always room for improvement.  I'm looking to
  use it as a logo, either for my blog or printed/embossed on a business card, so
  I'm flexible in terms of size, styling, weight, etc.  The top one is the core design,
  below is the \"stylized\" version I came up with on my netbook in MS Word (forgive
  the crudeness).  \r\n\r\nhttp://i39.tinypic.com/2r44oqh.png\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  or ideas?  Thanks."
