  to ask such things, so please forgive me! \r\n\r\nHow do I properly mix Hebrew and
  English? More specifically: Suppose you have a program menu: Should the English
  menu items be left-aligned? And what about the submenus? Should they be on the right?
  And what if there's a mix of Hebrew and English? Worse: What if I cannot predict
  if the items people will put on these menus are Hebrew or English? Should I try
  to distinguish the languages programmatically? And then do what? Or should I right-align
  everything, put the submenus on the left and be done with it?\r\n\r\nI'm confused."

  body: "Hebrew and Roman scripts are very hard to mix well. Not only do you have
    the problem of  l to r versus r to l, but also the difference in typographic 'color.'
    Roman has heavy verticals and light horizontals, and Hebrew is opposite. \r\n\r\nTo
    match typographic  color somewhat, you can choose Hebrew and Roman fonts that
    have relatively low contrast. (See the El Al logo.) Or you can design so that
    you deliberately contrast the weights of the Hebrew and Roman. \r\n\r\nGenerally
    speaking, the easiest way to use the two together is on mirrored pages, so they
    don't visually clash. The traditional thing is to have the Roman on the left page
    and Hebrew on the right page. But some have argued, I think correctly, that the
    other way around is preferable as a general rule. Then you need to match the color
    and height of the Hebrew and Roman. Often this means that the top of the Hebrew
    (except the pole on the lamed) is between the x-height and cap height of the Roman\u2014similar
    to a small cap of the roman. \r\n\r\nIf you keep both main and sub items with
    their same language, on mirrored pages, that's the easiest way. But you still
    have to deal with aligning mirrored passages of the same meaning, as whichever
    language is a translation will often be longer. \r\n\r\nNext easiest is to have
    the Hebrew and Roman on separate lines. Hardest is to have Hebrew and Roman work
    together visually on the same line. \r\n\r\nThere is no one best way to to solve
    the problem of the differences in direction and color. It will depend a lot on
    which language you expect most of your readers to read, how you expect different
    readers to consult the two languages, how much text you have, your choice of fonts,
    and so on. \r\n\r\nGood luck! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: Not sure if I made that clear, but I'm working on a multi-tiered multi-level
    drop-down menu on a website. The site itself is multilingual. The overwhelming
    majority of pages is monolingual however (except for the odd bit that still awaits
    translation). The menu will be shown on all pages - rtl pages and ltr pages alike.
    The menu is fully editable so I expect ltr users - like Hebrew speakers - to end
    up with a mix of ltr and rtl items on their menus. My guess would be the safe
    choice is to align everything right and add the submenus on the left. But I'd
    much rather leave the final word to a native speaker of Hebrew or another language
    that's written ltr. There's no way I can make this annoyance-free for Hebrew speakers
    I suppose. I was merely wondering what the least annoying version would be.

  body: "I don't understand the design problem enough. Is your menu on the top, left
    or right? And you have a typo: Hebrew is right to left. European languages are
    left to right. \r\n\r\nAs far as menus, many sites just have a link for 'English'
    and 'Ivrit' (in Hebrew script), and people click whichever menu system they want
    to work in. \r\n\r\nAlso you could have drop down or roll over menus, one in Hebrew
    and one in English. \r\n\r\nOn the alignment I would think it would depend on
    how long the items are, and where they are oriented. I'm not a native speaker
    (and not a very good speaker at that), so I can't tell you what they'd prefer.

  body: "Oh, yes, that was most definitely an error. I did mention that I find this
    confusing, didn't I? 0_O\r\n\r\nThe website is named Wikia which is a wiki hoster.
    Most wikis on Wikia are monolingual of course and the majority is (still) in English,
    but I've seen quite a few Hebrew wikis in my research.\r\n\r\nThe menu resides
    at the top and comes standard with every new wiki. My gadget adds a user-configurable
    section to the menu. It does not replace the entire menu or modify the rest of
    it. That means a lot of things are given. The menu's color scheme is up to the
    wiki's creators and as such out of my hands. The menu's typeface and general design
    is up to Wikia and as such out of my hands as well.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot
    of my menu in an English wiki:\r\n[[http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120613194318/central/images/4/42/Wikimarks-demo.png]]\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's an example of a Hebrew wiki:\r\n[[http://keremproject.wikia.com/]]\r\n(I
    cannot read Hebrew and I only arrived at this particular one by repeatedly clicking
    the \"Random Wiki\" button.  Please don't hold it against me or Wikia, if this
    wiki is about something stupid ;)\r\n\r\nCentering is a nice suggestion, but not
    really an option, I'm afraid. The added menu shouldn't look different from the
    rest of it, nor should adding the menu modify the rest.\r\n\r\nWhile I whould
    hope that users do not put rtl and ltr items on the same menu or submenu, they
    probably will. If you give users the option to ruin it for themselves, they will.
    So let's say, hypothetically, I did find a way to programmatically distinguish
    between English and Hebrew: Would it be good or bad, if there were items on the
    same menu that have different alignment? Or would aligning everything to the right
    and placing the submenus to the left be less messy?"

    [[http://www.masterfont.co.il/|Masterfont's site.]] But I would think that having
    everything on the left right aligned would be cleaner can having them bounce left
    and right. Especially if they are one or two words, which is usual for menus,
    it should be OK. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Yeah. I guess I should align right on Hebrew wikis - regardless of the menu
    item's language. The dir-attribute on the html-tag will decide which alignment
    it is then.

  body: "I recommend the following: Set all Latin flush left and all Hebrew flush
    right. Then determine a center line between the groups that ensures that neither
    language will extend beyond the other's line of departure, and that each will
    have a clearly identifiable position. That will be your measure.\r\n\r\nYou might
    try using the new Myriad Hebrew with Myriad Pro, both from Adobe. This will give
    you a wide range of compatible weights that will enable you to go smoothly from
    script to script without changing sizes. It was designed with just this sort of
    purpose in mind. It has been optimized for web use, including the vocalization
    diacritics.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on this board about Latin-Hebrew compatibility.
    It's a subject about which I find it impossible to generalize, as so much depends
    on the use. In much of my work, which concerns Hebrew liturgy in a multi-lingual
    context, the Hebrew needs to have pride of place rather than be smoothly integrated
    with the Latin. But there are other contexts, too, even within the same book.
    In your case, Xigam, you need very smooth integration, so the Myriad will be a
    perfect solution. I was, by the way, the principal consultant on its design and
    development.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"
