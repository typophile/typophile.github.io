  which reads,\r\n\r\n ' An adventure 65 million years in the making'\r\n\r\nhttp://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LoXqjF5hRRg/T-X_qLgpYXI/AAAAAAAACok/hQuJBvXTNMs/s1600/1993-jurassic-park-poster1.jpg\r\n\r\nIts
  pretty similar to Times new Roman but I'm looking for something with numerics more
  like this on the poster.\r\nI am almost certain that I have, seen/used it recently
  but its name has totally escaped me.\r\n\r\nmany thanks :)\r\nSteve W\r\n"
