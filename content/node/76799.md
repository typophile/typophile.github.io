  body: Everything seems back to normal now. From that thread, apparently all the
    printing was bigger for a while.

  body: "It's looking a bit heavy/large to me too, I like 12px much better. Bump to
    12.5 for a bit more size, maybe? The whole site would need to scale up with the
    type to keep the look working to my eyes at 13+ px\u2014but then it'd all be too
    big... so you can't win. Argh.\r\n\r\nThe general play of serif vs. sans and black
    vs. blue for content differentiation works well. Tweaks here and there are always
    fine and understandable, but I don't think bigger text is needed as a design direction.
    I visit here quite a bit on my mobile when on the go, and bigger text would make
    the lines shorter, and thus just make more lines of text for me to scroll through.
    \r\n\r\nJust thinkin' out loud."

  body: "Now the type size in the threads is out of proportion with the Forum menus.\r\nSo
    I adjust the size of one, and the other becomes too big/small.\r\n\r\nIt seems
    like the leading has been reduced too.\r\nOr is it just that the previous type
    size/leading was between the plus/minus size options now available?\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nFWIW,
    I preferred the previous site design, where the background was white -- and one
    could paste a sample of type and it became part of one's typography, not a boxed
    image."
