body: I'm trying to identify this typewriter font, which I believed was done in the
  Uk somewhere in the late 70's. If anyone is able to lend some clues that would be
  great. Alternate suggestions of a well designed typewriter font would be appreciated
  as well. Thanks!

  body: "It may be hard to find the exact same typewriter font in digital; but if
    you want a typewriter font that replicates the distressed/\xABdirty\xBB look of
    your sample, FF Trixie is certainly the queen of that genre, especially now that
    there is the extra detailed HD version: http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ff+trixie+hd"
