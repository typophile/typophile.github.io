  client when reviewing a design concept featuring Archer.\r\n\r\nThe client is a
  media comms person for a private all-girls school, ages 5-17. The brief is to renovate
  a tired school mag and make it modern and feminine.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure I like
  that font, (dare I say it) it's a little comic-sansy\".\r\n\r\nI was shocked at
  first, but then I had to laugh. I think I'm guilty of always trying to sneak Archer
  into a project somewhere, I just presumed everyone would love it! She didn't like
  Gotham either.\r\n\r\nShe did, how ever like Stag light, \"That one's just so modern
  and fresh\". It goes to show people don't have the same perceptions of a font as
  you. Now to find an appropriate pairing for Stag."
