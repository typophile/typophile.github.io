  to make wooden nameplates, so trying to stick as close to original font as possible.
  \r\nI am far from being a pro at this, so of course I be looking for something free
  to use.\r\nmy humble guess of closeness is comic sans for the one and freestyle
  for the other, but neither is really close.\r\nalready tried whatthefont, identifont,
  etc, got nothing even close.\r\nstumbled across here, and joined in the hopes someone
  knows what these are.\r\nThanks very much in advance for any and all suggestions.\r\n
  \ Thanks."

    I do now.\r\nand since I 'should' have had it, it made me look again for the 128th
    time and I figured out that \"Photography\" is Honey Script, which of course I
    already had but couldn't figure it out yesterday.\r\n\r\nApologies for posting
    something I should have been able to figure out on my own.\r\nBut Sincere Thanks!
    for the assist. Greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_3550.jpg]"
