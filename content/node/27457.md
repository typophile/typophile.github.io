  (taken from cubanica.com)\r\n\r\nCubanica is an independent design studio and font
  foundry founded by Pablo A. Medina.\r\n\r\nCubanica believes that design comes from
  the investigation and interpretation of culture. It is our job to find the cultural
  essence of each project we work on and speak in its language through the medium
  of design.\r\n\r\nOur work was included in the Design Triennial exhibition at the
  Smithsonian\u2019s Cooper Hewitt Museum as well as the Art Directors Club Young
  Guns III exhibition. A Cubanica book design for Coisa Linda is part of the Library
  Archives Collection at the Museum of Modern Art. Our work has appeared in numerous
  publications, among them Communication Arts Magazine, How Magazine, Idea Magazine,
  and Extreme Fonts.\r\n\r\nSome of our clients have included The Museum of Modern
  Art, Teen People Magazine, Harper Collins Books, The Art Directors Club, ESPN The
  Magazine, The National Hockey League, Ogilvy & Mather, Persea Books, Smithsonian
  Institution (Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum) and Upper and Lowercase Magazine.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cubanica.com/"
