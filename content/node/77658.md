  would love to hear your opinions and constructive criticism.\r\n\r\nCurrently Manila
  Sans has two weights regular & black. I'm planing to interpolate two more weights
  between these two when I'm satisfied with all the letterforms."

  body: "Looks good. You could tone down the inktraps in the black weight. They draw
    a lot of attention to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe bottom curve of Q looks heavy.\r\n\r\nSettle
    on a height at which to center all your math operators."

  body: "Neat work. Here are my observations:\r\n\r\nAgree about tail of Q; also ear
    of g and flag of 1 could be stronger.\r\nWaist of B needs thinning.\r\nBowl of
    R looks big.\r\nLowercase a and e may be a bit wide (compared to b, d and o for
    example).\r\nCrossbars on f and t will reduce readability; but perhaps this is
    more designed as a display face?\r\nTail of g seems stringy.\r\nLowercase h may
    be a fraction wide.\r\nMiddle of 3 looks a bit long.\r\nMultiply should have terminals
    cut perpendicular to strokes. It's also a little dark.\r\nHood of sterling could
    be rounded more like the S; it's a bit pointy.\r\nBeaks (?) of curly brackets
    could be stronger and have larger counters on the inside.\r\nThose +\u2212\xD7\xF7=<>
    also seem to be of different weights.\r\n"

  body: "@cerulean\r\nI'll try to minimize the inktraps in the black weight and post
    the updates later.\r\n\r\n@Bendy\r\nYes, this is designed more as a display face
    when I started working on it but also wanted it to be legible in small sizes.
    I'll try to make an f and t with regular crossbars to see what looks better.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the inputs, I'll get back for an update later."
