  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Suffice to say, the documentation of TT hinting is either too shallow (not explaining enough, as in the case of the Fontlab manual) or highly advanced (The Raster Tragedy). I have some questions that I'll just get right to:

1: What is the difference between single and double links?
2: The Raster Tragedy seems to say that with the correct hinting, very few deltas are needed, but doesn't describe a method (or I just couldn't decode the advanced language) to do so. Take for example an "o": with simple links, the stems are easily controllable, but the northeast/northwest/southwest/southeast areas will still have stray pixels or odd widths. How do you deal with those without deltas?
3: How far can the interpolation links move a point?
4: How do you approach diagonals?
5: How do you approach intersections, like in an "x"?
6: Is there a way to move an alignment zone one pixel for the whole font at a given ppm, or do I have to do this manually for each glyph?
7: How do you hint an "s"?
8: How do you hint diagonal terminals?

I realize this is a lot, but I've read all documentation I've been able to find in and out +10 times now and this baby ain't giving up her tricks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">> 1: What is the difference between single and double links?

With a single link, the origin point of the link needs to be "touched" by a different instruction (align, another single link, interpolation instruction). So a single link cannot exist "by itself", it needs to exist within a chain of instructions. If you add a new single link to an untouched point, FLS will automatically first add an alignment instruction. But if the point from which you start a single link already is touched by a different instruction, then FLS won't add the attachment. 

With a double link, you can specify a distance between two points but none of those points needs to be previously "touched". 

Example of double link (in the middle stem): 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tth-doublelink_3506.png]

Example of interpolation + single link (in the middle stem):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tth-interpolsinglelink_5326.png]

As far as hinting strategies for diagonals, intersections or "s", there are many. I hope that some more experienced hinters tune in here. 

Best,
Adam

Yes, you can use the yellow arrow on each alignment zone to adjust it for the current ppm. The Fontlab manual mislead me here because it talked about using this trick to fix single letters that were off on the x-height.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's an idea how an extra "stem" can be used to do some basic control of the diagonals. 

I've started hinting this glyph from the center outwards (in the x-direction). First, I've created a double link on the bottom "terminal", and interpolated the cusp point on it. 

I've created a new stem and made single links to the outside glyph boundaries and to the sidebearing points, plus single links inwards on the top terminals. 

Now, in the TrueType hinting options dialog, I can control the ppm3 value to decide how steep the diagonal should be at a given ppm. (Scroll the images to the right to see the TT hinting option dialogs. Observe the ppm3 value for the "X: v 393" stem, which is the "stem" that controls the width of the diagonals.)

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tth-diagonalstem2a_6142.png]

In a "v" shaped like this, starting from the middle with a double link and going outwards seems the most effective way to ensure the symmetry of the glyph while also maintaining control over the width of the flat terminals. </div>

Anything find valuable might be good or it could lose your path to greater knowledge based on the limits of the teacher.. But you never get her to give up her tricks UNLESS it begins with a Specification, as I've said before.

No one should even try to answer unless they know, are you aliased hinting only? Is the goal good lookin glyphs or readable text? Can you load up on deltas? Do you want to learn to hint, or learn to hint simple sans? How much time do you have? What do you want to spend?

And also, are you trying  to do it all in FL where the right result  for some specifications is impossible, or is the best you can do in FL as far as you ever want to go?

I take into consideration both the various rendering engines with and without hinting, meaning I’m also adjusting outlines and experimenting with various techniques to aid rendering regardless of hinting.

David's question about software (and related to it, time) is important. Visual TrueType is a free (Windows based) tool, which (IMHO) can give you a lot more control, and better results, than FontLab. But the learning curve is very steep.

Being XP with GDI CT, 96dpi, 9-12 pt.?

Get VTT, and let me know. If already got  Make sure your unhinted TT fonts install And function on windows , if you are FontValidator error message aware, validate them there instead. If you tell me you only use the Mac and can't afford a PC, then you are not going anywhere, ever, in the knid of tt hinting you've specified.

For any meeting the above criteria and wanting to pursue, open your font in VTT, select "Prepare Font" from whichever menu has it, agree to whatever it asks you to do, and save as something else. Then having the glyph window and  "control value table" (cvt) open, follow the documentation in the cvt, concentrating exclusively on alignments, and using the simple measuring tool measure the appropriate glyphs and fill those values into the cvt.

Once complete let me know and I'll tell you the six kinds of TT  hints you need to write, where, why and how.

		<div class="commentbody">Quoting David: &ldquo;0 x hints work as well as some since none are used by the CT rasterizers.&rdquo;

This is <em><strong>NOT TRUE!</strong></em> The basics behind the CT path of the Windows TrueType rasterizer are described in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec1|§4.1 ClearType &amp; &ldquo;Legacy Fonts&rdquo;]] and [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec2|§4.2 ClearType &amp; &ldquo;Legacy Applications,&rdquo;]] and I&rsquo;ll repeat what I highlighted in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec12|§4.1.2 Deltas &ldquo;Galore:&rdquo;]]

<strong>ClearType rendering does <em>not</em> generally ignore TrueType instructions in x-direction. It merely rounds them differently, and it bypasses distorting deltas.</em>

Greg has included some of my internal notes at the time in his post  [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx|Backwards Compatibility of TrueType Instructions with Microsoft ClearType]]. Some of these are gory details from a tight-rope walk between broken &ldquo;hinting&rdquo; code and making the result &ldquo;look nice&rdquo; anyway. But most of these &ldquo;jury rigs&rdquo; can be switched off as described in Greg&rsquo;s post and in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec12|§4.1.2 Deltas &ldquo;Galore;&rdquo;]] the latter should be safe to use on any version number of the TT rasterizer.

The exception to said switch is rounding to sample grid, and in tandem the CVT cut-in to samples.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for chiming in, Beat. A little word from monsieur Conarre now and I've had the whole TT royality stop by. 

I'm doing some experiments with smoothed Greyscale rendering at the moment. It has a tendency to turn out too light, but locking stems to the grid and adding a little weight to the rounds (with middle deltas) looks real nice to me. In fact, I find this more readable than binary rendering. Take for example italics: binary rendering is a disaster even with great hinting. Any opinions on that?</div>

Hinting for binary rendering of italics can only be described as making the best of a bad situation. And if that was your target, you'd have to concern yourself with phase control to get the best stepping patterns, which is just really complex.

		<div class="commentbody">Seconded. For fonts with a substantially uniform italic angle, you can make the overall appearance of text more consistent by replicating the same stepping pattern, conceptually speaking, across the entire font. Once you have found a set of criteria that yields the &ldquo;best&rdquo; (least offensive) stepping pattern (phase control, number theory problem, etc), you&rsquo;ll find that not every italic stroke extends from the baseline to the x-height or capheight&mdash;not to mention ascenders, descrenders, and serifs. Mathematically, this can be extrapolated as appropriate, while numerically this faces the &ldquo;multiple rounding jeopardy&rdquo; (cf. [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec02|§4.0.2]]) of the TT rasterizer, and to be consistent, this <em>must be exact</em> (cf.

		<div class="commentbody">@Frode, about gray-scaling: This sounds like a reasonable start. I&rsquo;d suggest to have a look at the seminal paper by  [[http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/99793/files/ptggf.pdf|Roger D. Hersch, Claude B&eacute;trisey, Justin Bur, and Andr&eacute; G&uuml;rtler, <em>Perceptually Tuned Generation of Grayscale Fonts</em>, IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications (Nov 1995)]] for inspiration. Roger was the co-referee of my PhD dissertation and Claude (another of Roger&rsquo;s PhDs) the colleague who brought me on board with Microsoft Typography at the time. Guided by Andr&eacute; G&uuml;rtler from the School of Design in Basel (my hometown), they devised a set of guidelines on, informally and very loosely put, where to &ldquo;put the gray.&rdquo; In summary, they recommend
<ol>
<li>to sufficiently reinforce thin strokes (cf [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh1.htm#Sec1|§1.1]]),</li>
<li>to allocate the gray on the trailing edge of vertical strokes, leaving the leading edge as sharp as possible,</li>
<li>to allow for sufficient black pixels on diagonal strokes (cf. “black core” in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec20|§3.2.0]]),</li>
<li>to allocate the gray on the outside of round strokes,</li>
<li>not to overemphasize serifs (cf [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec22|§3.2.2]]), and last but not least,</li>
<li>to use a consistent pattern of contrast profile across the entire font (cf [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec3|§3.3]]).</li>
</ol>
In other words, you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to put both the left and right edges of a stem on the grid (cf [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec10|Fractional Stroke Weights]]), but if you decide not to do so, their recommendations are e.g. to &ldquo;put the gray&rdquo; on the right of vertical straight stems (in a left-to-right script, #2 above) and on the outside of (vertical) round strokes (#4 above). </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Seconded. In plain gray-scaling, there are no color fringes to deal with, no issues with rendering color-on-color, no issues with rotating your screen into portrait orientation, and last but not least, downsampling with a box filter can get you the sharpest strokes with maximum contrast due to absence of &ldquo;bleeding.&rdquo; All of the above with a mere 4 bits/pixel (Windows implementation).

It&rsquo;s a lateral shift of compromises: I think ClearType and related sub-pixel anti-aliasing methods get you smoother italics, but at the expense of the color issues and 32 bits/pixel when including y-anti-aliasing (hybrid sub-pixel anti-aliasing).

What works for one end-user may not work equally well for another one.

Personally, during my last two years or so at Microsoft, I used &ldquo;Standard Font-Smoothing&rdquo; and an auto-hinted version of Corbel as my UI font. Such a nice and clean font, but on my 96 dpi desktop I couldn&rsquo;t handle the blur incurred by the unoptimized stems even in full-pixel positioning (cf [[http://www.beatstamm.com/Typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec1|§3.1 Anti-Aliasing &ldquo;Exclusion Principle&rdquo;]]). It was pronounced enough that I was questioned if I hadn&rsquo;t inadvertently left my CT tuner in BGR mode! On my 144 dpi laptop, plain gray-scaling got me smooth characters in both x- and y-direction, notably before DirectWrite. Looked sooo nice&hellip;

First, let me address the rounding in the presence of anti-aliasing methods like plain gray-scaling (I&rsquo;ll bring back the colors for ClearType and related sub-pixel anti-aliasing methods in the following post).

To render intermediate stroke weights, one can add a commensurate amount of gray e.g. to the trailing edge of stems, or as I&rsquo;ve observed in your <a href="http://typophile.com/files/FrankyShow4_4380.png">example</a>, on the inside of crossbars:

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/FranklinGothicBerlow.png">

To do so requires to put the respective edge on intermediate or fractional pixel positions, like so:

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/FractionalStrokeWeights.png">

How to do this with size independent x and y instructions (i.e. without a bazillion of deltas)?

<ol>
<li>Use &ldquo;super-round&rdquo; (<code>SROUND[]</code>)? This will only go as far as &ldquo;double-grid&rdquo; (<code>RTDG[]</code>), for a precision of 1/2 pixel. But the above example illustrates it could use 1/4 pixel (this is Windows gray-scaling specific, ClearType requires different fractions).</li>
<li>Leave the trailing edge unrounded? This is not unlike unhinted bi-level, except that in unfortunate cases this will give you another shade of gray on the trailing edge, instead of an extra row or column of pixels. The width of the stems below differs by a mere 1/64 of a pixel:

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/FractionalStrokeWeightsRasterTragedy.png">

Not very good if you want to render like strokes with like grays or colors (Hersch &amp; al&rsquo;s &ldquo;consistent pattern of contrast profile&rdquo;), plus few (if any) of the existing fonts did something to the effect of <code>&ldquo;if bi-level then round else don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</code></li>
<li>Rasterize with a DPI commensurate with the required pixel fraction and subsequently turn multiple pixels into gray (or color)? If all the fonts were hinted correctly, this might have worked. But many fonts had (too many) glyphs that didn&rsquo;t work under these conditions. Following is an example:

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/PalatinoItalicExplosion.png">

There are several causes for these &ldquo;explosions&rdquo; (typically on italics or diagonals):
<ul>
<li>numerical failure (with the freedom vector almost perpendicular to the projection vector)</li>
<li>bogus TrueType code (e.g. setting the dual projection vector perpendicular to a pair of points that have not been both touched in both x and y)</li>
<li>the <code>IP[]</code> instruction (with the [dual] projection vector neither in x nor in y doesn&rsquo;t work correctly with non-square aspect ratios, cf. [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec31|§4.3.1 Italic <code>IP[]</code> &amp; Overscaling]])</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

What to do? Fix all (!) faulty fonts, painstakingly agonizing over pixel-by-pixel backwards compatibility in black &amp; white rendering? I don&rsquo;t recall we ever seriously talked about this route in the ClearType team. Rasterize with a square aspect ratio, leaving all outlines to fall on whole pixels, like the above &ldquo;zen?&rdquo; We called it some name that may be too politically incorrect for publication. Hence I proposed that, for ClearType, with the projection vector not parallel to the long side of the LCD sub-pixels, any rounding instruction shall round to the required pixel fraction.

This fixed the &ldquo;explosions&rdquo; and it dodged the need to add code like <code>&ldquo;if bi-level then round to entire pixel else round to fractional pixel&rdquo;</code> all over existing fonts; the latter assuming there was a simple way to round to fractional pixels in the first place. What I didn&rsquo;t like about this solution is that it made some strokes blurrier than others, and at the time I was not the only one to notice. Deltas were added to &ldquo;sharpen&rdquo; the strokes, lots of deltas, at least to the core fonts, and at least at some sizes. The motto was &ldquo;Hinting puts the &lsquo;Clear&rsquo; into ClearType.&rdquo; Fair enough with me, at least at the time.

I gather you don&rsquo;t like this solution, and by now I&rsquo;m not particularly happy about it, either, particularly since meanwhile stroke &ldquo;sharpening&rdquo; seems to have fallen out of favor. In 20/20 hindsight, I could have added another <code>SCANTYPE[]</code> switch to revert rounding to pixel fraction to rounding to pixel, along with a new &ldquo;super-duper super-round instruction,&rdquo; to make it easier for TT experts like you to implement their preferred rounding strategy and hinting environment. At the time, this engineer had to compromise for the masses.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In this second post, I&rsquo;ll address the anti-aliasing filters. A disclaimer upfront: I&rsquo;m not an expert in the field of signal processing (that&rsquo;s the name for the part of computing that deals with anti-aliasing and its filtering methods), but so far I managed to understand it well enough to get my job done. Accordingly, I&rsquo;ll limit the discussion to describing the phenomena.

There are two main aspects: &ldquo;bleeding&rdquo; vs &ldquo;non-bleeding&rdquo; filters, and muting the color fringes.

Conceptually, for plain gray-scaling in Windows, characters are rasterized as if for black &amp; white rendering, but at 4 times the DPI in both x and y direction. Subsequently, these large characters are &ldquo;tiled&rdquo; into 4&times;4 squares. The anti-aliasing filter operates on these squares. For each square, it counts the number of pixels that are &ldquo;on.&rdquo; This yields a number in range 0 through 16. Finally, these numbers are associated with gray values: 0 gets white, 16 gets black, and 1 through 15 get intermediate shades of gray, with 1 a very light gray (almost white) and progressively darker through 15, a very dark gray (almost black). See the Raster Tragedy, [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh2.htm#Sec1|§2.1 Full-Pixel Anti-Aliasing]] for illustrations.

This simple anti-aliasing filter is called a <em>box filter</em>. For the purpose of this discussion, what&rsquo;s important about the box filter is that it does not appear to &ldquo;leak&rdquo; or &ldquo;bleed&rdquo; ink or color outside the boundaries of each &ldquo;tile.&rdquo; A 1 px wide stem or a crossbar that has its outlines aligned with the pixel boundaries will be black:

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CrossbarBoxFilter.png">

That same crossbar, anti-aliased with a <em>sinc filter</em>, instead of a box filter, appears to &ldquo;leak&rdquo; ink outside its boundaries, and its core is a dark gray, but not quite a solid black:

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/CrossbarSincFilter.png">

I&rsquo;m not expert enough to explain the theory behind this in simple terms, but this is the kind of filter that the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist-Shannon_sampling_theorem|Sampling Theorem]] (which is the foundation behind all things digital) requires. What I see is that the sinc filter appears to &ldquo;leak&rdquo; while the box filter doesn&rsquo;t. Compared to a box filter, the overall appearance of text rasterized and filtered with a sinc filter may be smoother, but slightly blurrier and with less rendering contrast: The core of the crossbar is less than black. I won&rsquo;t argue for one filter over the other, because to me this comes down to personal preference.

Enter the colors of ClearType and related sub-pixel anti-aliasing methods. The claimed benefit of sub-pixel rendering is that one can position e.g. a 1 px wide stem at fractional positions relative to the actual pixel boundaries. I&rsquo;ll start with 3 such stems, positioned at offsets &minus;1/3, 0, and +1/3 of a pixel, relative to the pixel boundary (left to right). In other words, they are positioned on the sub-pixel boundaries. The following illustration shows these 3 stems completely unfiltered and without gamma correction (see the Raster Tragedy, [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh2.htm#Sec2|§2.2 Asymmetric Sub-Pixel Anti-Aliasing]] for more illustrations):

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/3StemsUnfiltered.png">

The complete absence of filtering causes strong color fringing for the 2 stems offset by &plusmn;1/3 of a pixel, yet all 3 of them are made up of 3 adjacent black sub-pixels!

To make this into a workable solution, it is necessary to mute these color fringes down to a level that makes them hard to notice. To do so, informally put, the filter needs to &ldquo;smudge the line&rdquo; between adjacent unlit (black) sub-pixels and lit (colored) sub-pixels. In the process, the colors get muted, but so does the black. For the erstwhile black stem this means that it will become off-black, with the difference seemingly &ldquo;leaking&rdquo; out to adjacent pixels. Following is how ClearType does the filtering:

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/3StemsCTFilter.png">

This is blurrier than the unfiltered stems but with color fringing that is muted. Notice that all 3 stems are now made up of only 1 black sub-pixel; the remaining two are dark but in colors. That&rsquo;s one part of &ldquo;smudging the line&rdquo;&mdash;the other part is the &ldquo;leaking&rdquo; or &ldquo;bleeding.&rdquo;

Is this enough muting? According to the theory elaborated by MS Research, it should be, at least for most people at typical viewing distances. But I&rsquo;ve come across individuals who noticed color fringes at 144 DPI and a viewing distance of what I remember as about 2 feet (0.6 m). Accordingly, for these individuals the color fringing has to be muted down even further. Following is another filter that tends in the direction of more muting:

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/3Stems3rdFilter.png">

This may be perceived as even blurrier than ClearType but with color fringing muted to an even lower level. Notice that all of the 3 stems now contain no black sub-pixels whatsoever, and more color appears to have &ldquo;leaked&rdquo; on the left and right stems.

I&rsquo;ll repeat the above 3 illustrations at their original size, in hopes that this illustrates a trend (to be viewed on an RGB screen in native resolution, &ldquo;landscape&rdquo; orientation, and at 100% zoom):

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/3Stems3FiltersRGB.png">

Top to bottom decreases color fringing but increases blurring. Also, the middle stems appear sharper to me, relative to the left ones, and trailed by the right ones. If all of the above looks more or less blurry, try the BGR version below:

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/3Stems3FiltersBGR.png">

I don&rsquo;t know the exact filters that were implemented in DirectWrite or Quartz. There are a few &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; that experts at signal processing can use to improve rendering contrast (the &ldquo;black core&rdquo;) or &ldquo;sharpness&rdquo; of stems. As far as I understand, all these &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; affect intermediate shades of gray or color, in a way not entirely unlike gamma correction (hence I&rsquo;d encourage anybody reading this post to try the various gamma buttons at the end of [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh5.htm#Sec3|§5.3 Gamma Correction]] to develop some intuition of where this might go). But from my experience I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to learn that optimizing in one direction usually comes at the expense of another direction.

To recap, I&rsquo;m not trying to claim that ClearType is the &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; solution. It would require no &ldquo;rocket science&rdquo; to offer end-users a choice of filters&mdash;in addition to the choices I have proposed in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh6.htm#Sec37|§6.3.7]]. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, even Apple does this&mdash;offer a choice of filters&mdash;nota bene the same company that advocates the 1-button mouse just so that you can&rsquo;t click the wrong button. But I have no control over these decisions. The best I can do is to work with the existing filters and instruction set, and point into the direction of what could be if &hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Something? Yes! Couple of things come to mind:

<ul>
<li>Even if the MS TT rasterizer makes it hard to implement CT stroke &ldquo;sharpening&rdquo; in a size independent way, it can be done, as I&rsquo;ve shown. </li>
<li>
Even if a font maker decides that this is too hard, CT can take advantage of knowledgeable x instructions. Leaving them out altogether can lead to spacing accidents, as illustrated in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh3.htm#Sec30|§3.3.0 Constraint Priorities]] (the CT cap &lsquo;O&rsquo; towards the end of that section). Insufficient x instructions can also lead to spacing accidents, even with CT&rsquo;s &ldquo;Natural Widths,&rdquo; as illustrated in [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec21|§4.2.1 &ldquo;Natural&rdquo; Advance Widths in Practice]] (the string &ldquo;lellellel&rdquo; towards the end of that section).
</li>
<li>
Even if the application decides to layout text by fractional advance widths/sub-pixel positioning (not my favorite at the 8 to 18 ppem range&mdash;more like an accessibility issue), x instructions can be used to assert a minimum stem width of 1 px. As discussed in [[http://typophile.com/node/80015#comment-457508|another thread]], this requires to double the amount used for <code>SMD[]</code> but it can be done to help what little bit can be helped and not succumb to the verisimilitude-at any-price dogma.
</li>
<li>
Media tablets encourage changing orientation from landscape to portrait&mdash;a candidate for plain gray-scaling, with room to develop strategies on how much gray to allocate, and where to put it.
</li>
</ul>

Not every word is read on a device controlled by hard- and software made by Apple and Microsoft. There are 3rd party browsers and there is at least one 3rd party TT rasterizer.

<em>Spread the message: Font hinting is an opportunity to get on-screen text rendering as close to the art of printing as the available screen technologies allow.</em>

Interestingly put.
I happen to like hinted TT fonts in DirectWrite a lot. Much more than what I see on my Mac desktop.
However, on smaller screens - iPad, iPhone Retina display - if it's closer to the art of printing (didn't know printing was an art, thought it was a craft) then it's certainly less pronounced.

Personally, I couldn't care less about hinting as a way of reconciling a font designed with print in mind to the demands of the screen by adding hinting data for that purpose.

The two kinds of fonts have forked - fonts for print are one thing, fonts for the web, another.

But what I do like is that hinted TT fonts in DirectWrite have a look that says "this is HTML text". It's renders text in a way that's as visually appealing, but yet different from, the "look" of non-HTML text - text done with images or Flash replacement, or whatever. On the Mac, fonts look more like text as images.

No text on screen looks like printing to me. And emulating print doesn't seem to me like the right goal, either. (The Kindle, maybe, looks like print.)

Why look to simulate print onscreen?

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Point taken. This may be understood differently from what this non-native writer had in mind. I seem to have an unfortunate bias with the word &ldquo;craft&rdquo;&mdash;it conjures up connotations of &ldquo;bricolage&rdquo; (&ldquo;handicraft afternoon&rdquo; in elementary school) before any connotations of the skills learned for a trade like punchcutting or typesetting, let alone any aspects of art involved therein. Hence I tried to rise it above that (perceived) level and used the word &ldquo;art.&rdquo;

Art of printing is my oversimplification in an attempt to come up with a <code>&lt;META&gt;</code> tag for the Raster Tragedy home page, from where I borrowed the line without sufficient thought at the end of the post and day. What I really meant was the skilled m&eacute;tier of cutting the punches and casting the type to best adapt the type design to the available combination of metal, ink, paper, and type size. Today, hinting does (at least part of) this adaptation, and the screen replaces ink and paper.

Hence, depending on the screen technology and/or customer preference, a font may be hinted for B&amp;W, gray-scaling, ClearType, DirectWrite, or a combination thereof (or none of the above). One of the differences to the days of hot metal is that, strictly speaking, hinting is programming, it&rsquo;s <em>software</em>, hence it can cut different punches &ldquo;on-the-fly&rdquo; depending on the targeted ink and paper&mdash;and, of course, depending on the flexibility of the hinting.

Interesting point about the &ldquo;look of <code>HTML</code> text.&rdquo; For reading text online, I certainly prefer &ldquo;live&rdquo; text over images or Flash. Flash seems stuck at 72 dpi, which makes it an accessibility issue for me, and images are a similar handicap. As to DirectWrite, I like the y-anti-aliasing (I prototyped it during an exhausting weekend late 2000, after having been told that this has been tried already and it didn&rsquo;t work&mdash;hence the weekend), but depending on the combination of type size and resolution I have a hard time with the blur (a statement to that effect from [[http://www.typophile.com/node/33005#comment-197660|this post]] has been taken out of context, quoted in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearType#ClearType_and_human_vision|Wikipedia]], and used as some kind of &ldquo;proof&rdquo; in many forums on why ClearType is always blurry).

The long and the short of it, no, I don&rsquo;t advocate simulating print on screen, certainly not as the &ldquo;one size fits all gold standard.&rdquo; But repeating what I wrote above, hinting is software, hence it harbors the opportunity to cater to a plurality of applications (print preview, web reading, &hellip;), screen devices (desktop, laptop, media tablet, smart phone, &hellip;), and end-user preferences (or accessibility requirements).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Difficult (if not impossible) to say without looking at the font in VTT (or a similar tool).

In [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec21|&ldquo;natural&rdquo; widths]], VTT will show you a right side-bearing point on a fractional x-position and hence you&rsquo;ll have a fractional advance width, but subsequent layout will be to full pixels (if the RSB point happens to be integer, it's plain luck with the numbers). If the fractional part is less than 32/64 (= less than 0.5), it will be rounded down&mdash;you&rsquo;ll get that part of the right side-bearing &ldquo;truncated.&rdquo; If it is 32/64 or more, the fractional part will be rounded up&mdash;you&rsquo;ll get the right side-bearing &ldquo;padded&rdquo; by the round-off. Neither will help the spacing.

Chances are that text laid out to full pixels will use [[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec20|&ldquo;compatible&rdquo; widths]], which may fix some of the spacing issues, at the expense of messing with the glyph proportions (this may seem odd but that&rsquo;s what this &ldquo;lesser evil band-aid&rdquo; called &ldquo;compatible&rdquo; widths is supposed to do).

To double-check what the correct advance width should be, in pixels, evaluate

<code>px = (pt &times; dpi &times; aw)/(72 &times; emHeight)</code>

and round the result. If you allow integer ppem sizes only (VTT forces this flag&mdash;I was told to do so) then first determine your ppem size

<code>ppem = (pt &times; dpi)/72</code>

round the result, and then evaluate

<code>px = (ppem &times; aw)/emHeight</code>

and round the result&mdash;again ([[http://www.beatstamm.com/typography/RTRCh4.htm#Sec02|&ldquo;Double Rounding Jeopardy&rdquo;]]). This may yield a different advance width in (rounded) pixels, but that&rsquo;s because e.g. 11 pt at 96 dpi gets rounded to 15 ppem while the actual ppem size would be 14 2/3.

		<div class="commentbody">John, that's weird, maybe it's a browser thing. I always try the links in preview mode before posting.

Beat, I asked because I've seen spacing problems like those on some fonts for the web (as well as some of my projects) and I always assumed they were produced by rounding errors in "natural" widths. At least now I know not to assume and also how to check them out in my own proyects. Thanks ;)

(Edit: also, I need to re-read the Raster Tragedy and the TT specs a few more times and start trying and messing more things up. There are to many thing I don't understand.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">José Miguel: The example I posted makes little or no use of x direction hints. This is, btw, not done in VTT. I haven't touched the widths/sidebearings at all, but I plan to even out problems like this with a combination of x direction links, x direction deltas (not used by Cleartype) and manipulating the character widths (prior to hinting). I've snapped all stems to the pixel grid on the left edge, but allow them to flow free on the right edge.</div>

Safest for me, though most arduous, is to obtain a pixel-by-pixel match between what I see (e.g. in the browsers) and what I can setup in VTT (&ldquo;compatible&rdquo;, &ldquo;natural&rdquo;, or &ldquo;fractional&rdquo; widths, y-anti-aliasing, and gamma correction). Like that I can see that Chrome 10, FireFox 3.6, Internet Explorer 7, and IE 8 use &ldquo;compatible&rdquo; widths without y-anti-aliasing, while Safari 5 (on Windows) uses unhinted fonts with y-anti-aliasing, but no fractional advance widths.

To see fractional pixel positioning with y-anti-aliasing (aka <em>DirectWrite</em>) in action, I installed FireFox 5.0 on Windows 7, turned on <em>Options => Advanced => Use hardware acceleration when available</em>, but apparently on my test machine (laptop/tablet convertible) this is not available, hence I&rsquo;ll do the respective illustrations in the comparison below in VTT.

The following illustrations show the RTM version of Calibri at 11 pt and 96 dpi, no gamma correction (to match rendering [font-smoothing medium] in Quartz/Safari 5.0 for Windows, which either doesn&rsquo;t offer gamma correction, or if it does, I haven&rsquo;t discovered it)

&ldquo;Compatible&rdquo; widths, rendered in Chrome 10 (same results for IE 8, and for FF 5.0 without HW acceleration)

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/Calibri11pt96dpilellellelSafariRTM10x.png">

Integer widths, rendered in Safari 5 on Windows.

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/Calibri11pt96dpilellellelNatAWRTM10x.png">

&ldquo;Natural&rdquo; widths, rendered in VTT (same as Office 2007 &ldquo;Web Layout&rdquo; mode, which is a &ldquo;reflow&rdquo; layout, but kind of looks like a bad &ldquo;wysiwyg&rdquo; layout)

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/Calibri11pt96dpilellellelFractAWRTM10x.png">

Fractional advance widths, rendered in VTT (this is the spacing I would expect from DirectWrite&mdash;if this were available on my test machine).

For demonstration purposes I re-hinted the key characters of Calibri, minimizing any issues with &ldquo;natural&rdquo; widths in TT code. The following illustrations show this (non-RTM) version of Calibri.

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/Calibri11pt96dpilellellelNatAWNew10x.png">

Actual natural widths, rendered in VTT, true to 11 pt and 96 dpi (non-RTM version of Calibri, using fractional ppem sizes)

Actual fractional advance widths, rendered in VTT, true to 11 pt and 96 dpi (non-RTM version of Calibri, using fractional ppem sizes)

Compare line lengths of the preceding illustrations&mdash;the last one is closest to Luc[as] de Groot&rsquo;s design.

On a slight tangent, following is a juxtaposition of the above sample rendered in Safari 5 on Windows with the same sample rendered in VTT with actual natural widths and y-anti-aliasing.

Substantially the same spacing, but the proportions of the lc &lsquo;e&rsquo; appear different&mdash;the bottom one is closer to Luc[as] de Groot&rsquo;s design.

And here are the same illustrations at their original sizes (be sure to reset your zoom to 100%)

<img src="http://www.beatstamm.com/temp/Calibri11pt96dpilellellelNatAWyAANew.png">

Different degrees of &ldquo;bold,&rdquo; different &ldquo;sharpness&rdquo; of strokes, different levels of color &ldquo;fringing,&rdquo; but neither one of them as scalable as actual fractional advance widths using fractional ppem sizes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Frode, I'm sorry for using your images as examples. I understand they are tests. I just wanted to use the opportunity to ask. Concerning your plans about snapping the left edge, I have some questions. In a serif font, would you snap the first point to the right, meaning it could be a serif or a stem, or would you snap only the stems and let the serifs free? And also, what kind of anchors would you use? I've been testing some stuff concerning this and perhaps I will post something later.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Beat, it's amazing the difference Fractional advance widths make. Now, if Chrome uses "compatible" widths then the spacing problems I see on some web fonts (and my fonts, sadly) are within this kind of advance width, as this is my usual browser. I have IE9 and FF5 (with DirectWrite rendering activated) and I think fonts look amazing there, but prefer, at least for now, to use Chrome (and GDI) because it's what other people use and see (and Chrome just works better;).

I'll have to start testing solutions having in mind both horizontally snapping stems and just adjusting the character widths. I think, at least for now, those are my only options at trying to solve this.</div>

And yes, these are just tests. I'm certainly not insulted: These are my results just a few weeks into the hinting game. I'm still figuring out the tools (FL for now, VTT at a later stage), and experimenting with strategies.

There are a number of things to consider here, and perhaps most important is this: How much time is it viable to spend on hinting?

		<div class="commentbody">Actually, looking at my samples I realized I forgot to do my little interpolation fix to align the right edges of the first stem in this particular glyph.

There's a HUGE gap between basic x direction hinting in Fontlab and the kind of stuff Beat is talking about. The former tend to cause more trouble rather than order, at least for (smoothed) Standard GDI and Cleartype. 

Another thing to take into consideration is the difference in appearance between platforms. Snapping to the pixel is not neccesarily the best option.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Until now I've only been doing Y-direction hints. That can be done fast if your font is fairly regular in stem widths. The problems I've been struggling with concern spacing and are probably caused by not paying much attention to character widths, and thus, not fixing them. I also assumed they were rounding problems and that they were too difficult to solve (I imagined mountains of TT coding and stuff like that). At least now I understand a bit better what my final environment is and now I have other possibilities to test. I'll try some stuff on my font and then post images.</div>
