  body: "When I first saw this, my initial thought was Della Robbia, but the M and
    N don't match, nor is it high-waisted.\r\n\r\nEven after finding a better image
    on the Bonham's website, I still can't place it. Maybe the new image will help
    someone else:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GardnerSerpollet_3607.png]"

  body: "Looks like an embossed book cover. Based on lettering. Note differences in
    repeated letters, for example _R_ has five variations.\r\nThomas Maitland Cleland's
    design for Della Robbia was released by ATF circa 1902 and was a success. This
    could account for the similarities between the mini-serif low contrast style of
    these letters from 1903 and Della Robbia, which has this style. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DellaRobbia1_4152.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DellaRobbia2_4424.gif]\r\nSome
    of the lettering follows Della Robbia's distinctive letterforms, such as _G_,
    \ but most are almost generic lettering. For some letters the lettering artist
    followed letterforms that were popular circa 1900, such as the _N_ with it's raised
    diagonal stroke.\r\nAFAIK this lettering has not been made into a font.\r\nDon"
