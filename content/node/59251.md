  tag listing. Seems to be a strikingly popular category  ;-)\r\nGiven you\u2019re
  searching for a specific kind of typeface, will you scroll through the entire list
  \u2026? \r\nI think a more descriptive mode of tagging fonts would be helpful. \r\nLet\u2019s
  suppose a catalogue like: \r\n      \xB7 Calligraphic\r\n      \xB7 Cancellaresca\r\n
  \     \xB7 Decorated\r\n      \xB7 Floral\r\n      \xB7 Fashion\r\n      \xB7 Commercial\r\n
  \     \xB7 Upright\r\n      \xB7 Connected\r\n      \xB7 Brush\r\n      \xB7 \u2026\r\n
  \           may do a better job. \r\n\r\nAre there any attempts in that direction
  going on? Would it be a sensible thing to do?\r\n\r\n(Of course, this is an issue
  not with script fonts alone.)"

    can <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Aupright+tag%3Ascript/fonts/\">combine
    your search criteria</a>. And even in the old version the fonts were tagged so
    you could search for \xBBfloral\xAB, \xBBfashion\xAB and so on. Or am I misuderstanding
    something?"

  body: Well, it depends on how the tagging is done. Do the designers add tags themselves
    or does MyFonts do that? If the designers do it themselves, there is no way you
    can direct the usage of tags. They'll do whatever they want. ;)

  body: "Combining tags for searching is one option, surely. I just made a few tests:\r\n\r\n\xB7script\u2013upright
    \ \u2013 10 hits\r\n\xB7script\u2013upright\u2013decorated  \u2013 0 hits\r\n\xB7script\u2013handwriting
    \ \u2013 981 hits, a lot of them being questionable for the latter tag.\r\n\r\nSo
    I\u2019m not sure how relevant these results actually are.\r\nThats the problem.
    The tagging is done individually and fairly arbitrarily, by the vendor himself.
    Perhaps, what I was thinking about is rather a kind of *classification* which
    puts a font clearly into one category. The few categories established at Myfonts
    so far is a rather humble approach \u2026"
