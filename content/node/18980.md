    Latin Extended A\r\nhttp://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0100.pdf _\r\nI have a
    question concerning two characters:\r\n\r\n1) 0138 - Kra: Exactly how is it supposed
    to look different than the normal Latin \"K\"? You can't really know from that
    one Times sample. Seeing as how it's from the dead* language of Greenland (which
    is melting away as we speak anyway) I neither expect to get a firm reply nor should
    I be too concerned I guess. But still, if anybody knows, or knows somebody who
    knows, it would be nice to know. BTW, the 1862 specimen book of the Mekhitarist
    monks (still going strong on San Lazzaro, Venice) happens to show, along with
    32 other languages/scripts, text in Greenlandic, and there's a normal looking
    lc \"k\" in there. One thing about Greenlandic btw, it seemingly had the most
    impressively and consistently longest words, like \"tamm\u0153garalloamnik\" is
    about average, and then there's \"Ajortulliorkaungak'illangmutIllingnuldo\" (yes,
    it had intercaps too!).\r\n\r\n* I should say \"dormant\" (since a concept can
    never really die).\r\n\r\n2) 0149: Is it \"not actualy a single letter\" or what?
    If it's two characters, why is it in Unicode? If not: How close/above the \"n\"
    can I put the apostrophe? What can come right before this \"letter\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    no ascender.  It looks more like a Greek kappa.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    have a feeling that people setting Afrikaans can elect to use either\r\nthe compound
    or the discrete encoding - which is certainly Not Good.\r\n(BTW, it's not really
    a regular apostrophe - that actually has a\r\nseparate encoding from the one used
    in this little anomaly.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Re. U+0149. This is one of those peculiar characters that is included in
    Unicode solely because of its presence in one of the pre0existing standards subsumed
    into Unicode. Some of these standards were industry-specific, e.g. the Dutch telecom
    standard from which we apparently get the  digraph distinct from the sequence
    ij that Dutch people actually type. My guess is that U+0149 comes from a similar
    South African standard.\r\n\r\nIt has a compatibility decomposition to U+02BC
    U+006E, which means that it may be decomposed to that two-character sequence,
    \u02BCn, but that sequence may not be composed to U+0149.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can
    tell, there is no Afrikaans keyboard layout: they use the US Standard layout.
    So users almost certainly type 'n (U+0027 U+006E) and completely ignore both U+0149
    and its compatible decomposition. Just because something is in Unicode or WGL4
    does not mean it is used, or used widely.\r\n\r\nI would take the phrase 'not
    actualy a single letter' to mean that this doesn't sort separately from n in typical
    Afrikaans sorting, although I have no evidence for or against this interpretation.\r\n\r\nThere
    are lots of characters in Unicode that can be encoded in multiple ways, with either
    canonical (reversible) or compatibility (non-reversible) encodings. It is 'good/normal'
    so long as your applications and fonts are ready for this :)"
