  a problem to deal with because the accents are vertically stacked. Usually when
  figuring out font metrics, I assume Aring is as tall as it gets and scale accordingly.
  But sometimes I later need to add Vietnamese accents. When I refer to Bbox limit
  I mean the highest point. In my case, it's usually the same as the Winascent and
  hhea Ascender.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, there are 3 solutions:\r\n\r\n1: Reduce
  the size of the entire font to allow for the high accents which will make the font
  look tiny compared to other fonts and in some apps it will affect line spacing.
  Not a great option when adding to existing fonts.\r\n\r\n2: Squashed accents which
  don't exceed the Aring height. This can be acceptable for display fonts but not
  so good for text.\r\n\r\n3: Go beyond the upper Bbox limits (usually the Aring height).\r\n\r\n\r\nSome
  OS core fonts have Vietnamese upper accents which go beyond the Bbox limit. What
  happens to Vietnamese core fonts in various browsers? I assume the accents wouldn't
  get clipped. Do browsers pad the line spacing with Vietnamese the same way they
  pad superiors & ordinals? What are the negative consequences to exceeding the Bbox
  limit this way?\r\n\r\n"

    Windows apps. Of course, you wouldn't \"go beyond the BBox limits\" exactly: you'd
    increase the BBox but not the os_2.usWinAscent and hhea.Ascender.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Outside of high end graphics apps used by creative professionals, the overwhelming
    majority of Windows apps clip to the WinAscent/WinDescent extents. MS Office does,
    at least through Office 2007. \r\n\r\nOffice 2010 still normally uses them to
    determine line spacing, not sure about clipping. There is an extra bit you can
    set to make Office 2010 pay attention to the Typo metrics instead, for line spacing.

  body: "@thomas, that's what I meant by #1. For me it involves scaling down by my
    fonts are usually squeezed into the OpenType vertical limits.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination
    of Windows core fonts I get the feeling that the original fonts were designed
    without Vietnamese accents in mind. To retain the original vertical metrics, they
    had to squeeze the high Vietnamese accents. I put the red line at the Winascent
    so you can compare the Aring height as well.\r\n\r\nCourier Bold\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Courier1_6562.PNG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Courier2_4543.PNG]\r\n\r\nArial
    Bold\r\nThe Aring was lower than some other accents.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arial_4205.PNG]\r\n\r\nCorbel
    Bold\r\nThis was probably designed with high accents in mind. I guess that's why
    it looks smaller compares to the earlier Windows core fonts. If I change my browser
    default to Corbel, I have to go up a point size or two.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/corbel1_4820.PNG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/corbel2_4743.PNG]\r\n\r\nCanadara
    Bold\r\nSimilar to Corbel\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/candara1_4262.PNG]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/candara2_5361.PNG]\r\n\r\nNot
    related to Vietnamese, but in lots of Core fonts, the Aringacute pops over . .
    . but nobody uses them anyway so it who'd notice?\r\n\r\nSo it seems like allowing
    for the high accents is the proper way to go unless you're adding to a font where
    backwards compatibility is a high priority. Has anyone seen Vietnamese accents
    that pop over the vertical limit? How about other OS core fonts?\r\n\r\n"

  body: I ran in the same problem when I needed to do [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/exljbris/4661584330/|Vietnamese
    for Dell]]. Steve Matteson (Ascender/Droid fonts) adviced me to reduce the height
    of the caps with the stacked accents, which I did.

    I wonder if this has changed in Office 2010?"

  body: "Thomas: <em>But you're going to tell me it was 2006-07.</em>\r\n\r\nI remember
    presenting my analysis of the problems of Windows linespacing at ATypI in Prague
    in 2004. I remember it well because I was running late to get to the session,
    and thoughtlessly hopped into a taxi that turned out to be unlicensed, with a
    meter that counted up at an incredible rate and a driver who tried to give me
    Hungarian currency as change. At the hotel, everyone crammed into one of the small
    rooms being used for tech workshops, and many of us ended up sitting on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe
    2004 context of the sudden urgency around the long practice of apps using OS/2
    usWin values to determine default linespacing, although I couldn't say so at the
    time, was the MS Cambria Math font. We needed a way to get Word to scale to the
    Typo values in the font menu, because otherwise the Cambria Math font looked like
    it was about 3pt. Fortunately, Greg and Si and others at MS agreed that a general
    mechanism within the OT spec was a good idea, the other option being a font-specific
    hack in Word.\r\n\r\nThe other table version 4 changes to the OS/2 fSelection
    bit came later."
