  me with my typography problems!\r\nIm really liking the beautiful typeface by Marcus
  Piper called FIDO, used as a headline font within POLOXYGEN. It seems this is not
  avaliable for purchase- Im wondering if there is something similar avaliable?\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much for your help!\r\n\r\nBest from New Zealand!\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Hi Jason,\r\n\r\nYes it's the thin one called FIDO which I developed early
    last year and ended up using in the redesign of Oxygen. As it is being used in
    Oxygen I can't sell it on for a year... but that is almost up and there will be
    a version available. Get your order in I guess...\r\n\r\nMarcus"
