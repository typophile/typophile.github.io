body: "During a typedesign-course at university, I started to develop this typeface,
  which is meant to have kind of a nordic touch to it.\r\nThe most basic characters
  are in it, but I feel it could be a lot better, so I'm looking for critique to eliminate
  errors and overall spice it up a notch.\r\n\r\nI've started making a bold (or extra
  bold) version but feel, that the regular should really shine before putting all
  the effort in doing different weights.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Any suggestions,
  critique and comments are highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: That's quite good. H U N are too narrow and L is too wide. Perhaps you should
    add something to make it a little more unique. Keep going!

  body: 'I''m not qualified to comment deeply on this, but I did notice a need for
    overshots. The thinnest weight does feel nordic (modern, sleek - I''m nordic but
    definitely not modern or sleek, but I know what you mean though), the heaviest:
    clumpsy. Like your R. Reminds me of Unit Slab. Maybe it''s the overall width.'

  body: "Needs some polishing but it's a pretty likeable start.\r\n/J/ looks narrow
    to me. /b/d/p/q/ may be a bit narrow too. /g/'s bowls look quite wide compared
    to other letters.\r\nTerminal on /r/'s arm looks a bit harsh.\r\nIs there a way
    to adjust /M/ so that its middle counter isn't so outsized relative to the two
    side counters?\r\nWould you consider making the \"x-height\" of the oldstyle figures
    a little bigger than that of the letters? "

  body: "Thank you very much for your response. \r\n\r\n1996type: I agree to H U N
    being too narrow (especially U!) and L being a bit wide, I\u2019ll fix this.\r\n\r\nfrode
    frank: There is overshoot, but probably too little. The Extrabold is very clumsy,
    yes but I don't really know what to do about it. My plan was to do a multiple
    master (it's the topic of the course), that's why I chose such a extreme weight.\r\n\r\neliason:
    I agree on J, tail (or what do you call it?) could be longer, not sure about b,
    d, p, q, but i'm definately not cool with g, yes the bowl is kind of wide and
    the shape itself is bad I think. I think the balance of the M is fixed by slanting
    the outer strokes a bit, plus maybe narrow the middle counter a bit, so the letter
    doesn\u2019t get too wide. About the osf: I probably should, shouldn\u2019t I?\r\n\r\n///\r\n\r\nI
    got in a rush today and yesterday night and did numerals in capital height and
    a set of small caps. The weight of the small caps is a bit too heavy, as seen
    when mixed with normal text in the new PDF. However, I like the small caps much
    better than the orfinary capitals (they are a bit wider). I'm considering reducing
    the capital height a bit to make the capitals look less condensed and a bit more
    like the small caps. Maybe even reduce the ascenders and descenders a bit.\r\n\r\nThank
    you all again for you thoughts, It's really valuable to me. It's now 7am \u2013
    I really need to go to bed. ;)\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nPhillip\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://knisterwerk.com/skadi/4_sc_num.pdf"

  body: "Yes, the width and proportions in the smallcaps are indeed much better. I
    say scale them up, and use them as a mask to adjust the uppercase. \r\n\r\nThe
    bottom bowl of g is too large and I don't really like the shape of the bowl in
    a. I think it should be more horizontal. Next time perhaps also upload some text
    samples? Numerals are quite good, but I think 8 needs some 'squarishness'. The
    horizontals in z look too thin and the overall width of the lc is quite condensed.
    You could try just scaling the whole thing (including original caps) horizontally.
    This would also increase the contrast, but I don't know if that's a bad thing.
    Keep going!"
