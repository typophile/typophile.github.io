  to be companion of <a href=\"http://www.dstype.com/type_families/maga\">Maga typeface</a>
  (a serif typeface released by DSType foundry).\r\n\r\nI'll be using this typeface
  on Light and Bold weights (light for running text and big quotes and bold for main
  titles ) in a website I am creating at the moment .\r\nI will use the sans serif
  companion for the captions, figure caption, and sub-heads, buttons \u2026 basically
  all secondary text.\r\n\r\nI looking for something that is beautiful, readable,
  modern, and web friendly.\r\nSomething with the size, color and beuty of Rijks Museum
  <a href=\"http://www.boldmonday.com/en/rijksmuseum\">custom typeface</a>. I know
  that they develop the typeface based on Penno, but Penno doesn't have the same qualities
  as in this one.\r\n\r\nGive me some hits guys\r\nThank you all\r\nF\xE1bio Santos"
