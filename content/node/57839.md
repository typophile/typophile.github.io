  use). \r\n\r\nHowever, I can't afford the price set forth by the font companies.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a freeware font quite similar to this one?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot."

    introduction to the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=230\">work
    of a typedesigner</a> by [[Yves Peters]], and <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/content/value/index.html\">The
    Value of Type</a> by [[Erik van Blokland]]. Furthermore, have a look at the [[FAQ
    Free]].\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows comes with a handsome sans-serif font family
    by [[Joshua Darden]], the designer of Freight. [[Corbel]] has four weights, very
    wide language support (including Cyrillic and Greek), small-caps, various figure
    styles and more. Note that Corbel is <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/38272\">not
    a free font</a>.\r\n\r\nBTW, here\u2019s a link to <a href=\"http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/freight_sans\">Freight
    Sans</a>.\r\nF"

    still think Corbel could serve as a nice high-quality alternative for the smaller
    budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    use something else and save up for Freight!"
