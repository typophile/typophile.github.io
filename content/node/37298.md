body: "Hello Everyone,\r\n\r\nI am creating a logo for a neighborhood. This is not
  an official state or city entity, but the logo will be used by an small business
  association to advertise various neighborhood events sponsored by local businesses.
  Mt. Airy is well known for being a diverse community with a lot of emphasis on progressive
  politics (its where the hippies live).In short I am looking to create something
  casual, fun, & contemporary (but definitely not corporate.)\r\n\r\n1. I am looking
  for input on the sketches below\r\n2. I am looking for typefaces to inspire and
  inform the characteristics of the letter forms in the logo (as the logo will usually
  appear alongside the name of various events).\r\n\r\nSo far I  been looking at the
  likes of Cheltenham, ITC Grouch, Bernhard Antiqua, they feel not quite contemporary
  enough, was considering Los Feliz from Emigre for a more up to date look...any other
  suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks! Malcolm.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mtairy06_5691.gif]"

  body: I like the third one - it gives the impression of mountains and streams as
    opposed to just pretty swashes, although the second one is quite well executed
    and lovely...

  body: "I'm mix up a bit. I like the junction of the M (first version) with the first
    line under the name, but not really the junction with the y. I like the second
    one (less line under the name compare wiht the third one where I find there are
    too much line under) and finally I like what you've done with the A in the third
    one . What I'd suggest is as mix of the one and the third. Hoping this will help
    you not mix up you too much.   = :\xAC)"

    well drawn, and just enough going on to evoke your idea. I dont know how far you
    have gotten on this project, but I thought I give you my opinions. It looks most
    'happy'\r\n\r\nRez"

  body: "well. let's put it this way. Mount Airy is a complete community. So I guess
    both words should be connected. In this perspective #2 works best.\r\n\r\nSince
    A is rather wide compared to M, I'd widen the M a bit by slanting vertical stems
    outwards on the bottom.\r\n\r\nAnd make sure that A's swash doesn't go all the
    way to the end of \"y\", because the curve also doesn't go all the way to the
    left of the M.\r\n\r\n#3 has too many lines underneath, #1 seems closed... Because
    you close Airy to itself and M swash intrudes the Airy...\r\n\r\nI'd definitely
    go with #2... With corrections."

  body: "Thank you for the comments.Another possible solution here, I sometimes feel
    as if the connected letters are a bit \"fake\" or contrived...as if that would
    never happen if I were writing these swashes (as opposed to drawing them). This
    solution addresses that issue as well as those raised by litera. This drawing
    is bit rougher that then the other two.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mtairy06_3601.gif]"

  body: "I prefer the third option in the latest iteration, where each swash is only
    connected to one letter. However, I would \"weave\" the downward swash from the
    'A' between the other two as in your other two designs. You could also try weaving
    them the other way (over the top, under the bottom).\r\n\r\nThe swashes both come
    off the word \"Airy\" - this may be intentional, but you might want to try one
    with a swash off the 'M' and 'y' to bookend the name, or even 'M', 'A', and 'y'
    all interwoven but not connected.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "I would consider using the lefthand side of the M to lead into a swash, either
    the top or bottom. While Cheltenham might be a good choice (you might consider
    Horley Oldstyle also), they, in conjunction with the swashes, remind me of old
    British motorcycle logos for Norton and Triumph, I would take a look at a sans
    source like <a href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/aspect.htm\">Aspect</a> or
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/estilo-script/\">Estilo Script</a>.\r\n\r\nTim"

    \"AIRY.\" the underline works better under the MOUNT, but the weird space under
    the second word just builds a weird shape into the mark.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mtairy06_3601_3937.gif]"
