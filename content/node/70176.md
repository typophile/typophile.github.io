  body: 'I think overall this is kind of bland for an arts organization. Even if you
    made the colors richer it would help. If I were handed this assignment I would
    go for a more progressive and "fun" feel to the branding. I would not use Lithos,
    it''s a typeface dead-set in the 90''s. Feel free to contact me directly if you''re
    looking for a graphic designer. '
