  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hey all</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a final year graphic design student in the process of writing my dissertation and I looking for people opinions to use in my third chapter of analysing what people think are good/bad typefaces and why. I will then use this information to investigate whether a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; typeface could be designed.</p>
<p>My working title at the moment is &ldquo;can a perfect typeface be designed or does it already exist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Main questions I&rsquo;d like answered are:</p>
<p>What are your top five favourite typefaces and why?
What are you top five &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; or near perfect typefaces in your opinion and why? (if they differ from the question above)
What are your least favourite typefaces and why?
What are in your opinion the worst five typefaces and why? (if they differ from above again)</p>
<p>Although any other opinions/information/advice/pointers will be very appreciated and will really help!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

Such are those, generally of scientific bent, who pursue the cult of readability.</p>
<p>I hold that in typography the perfect typeface is the one that&rsquo;s right for the job at hand—and the hand and eye of the typographer who&rsquo;s doing the job. So that suitability, aptitude and experience are aspects of the typographer&rsquo;s choice of type tools, as much as taste.</p>
<p>Bacon still worth pondering:

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here&rsquo;s where I would start:</p>
<ol>
<li>Watch the film Helvetica again</li>
<li>Take a look at all the newer typefaces that are meant to either improve helvetica, or to be somehow truer to the helvetica&rsquo;s roots. ie: Bruno Maag&rsquo;s &ldquo;Helvetica Killer,&rdquo; Christian Schwartz&rsquo;s Neue Haas Grotesk, Michael Hernan&rsquo;s Uniform.</li>
<li>Read about Univers in Frutiger&rsquo;s big book.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then consider the claim to neutrality. And even if Schwartz isn&rsquo;t after perfection or neutrality in his design of Neue Haas Grotesk &ndash; well, that doesn&rsquo;t really matter. Surely we can strip out our intentional fallacies when viewing and critiquing type design. Which is to say that the intent of the designer isn&rsquo;t as important as the design&rsquo;s reception and use.</p>
<p>Last, and most important, read:
Distinction: A Social Critique of Judgment and Taste, by Pierre Bourdieu</p>
<p>Your thesis really is one part typography and at least one part sociology.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am of the scientific bent, and I do pursue the cult of readability, but I do also think that beauty is functional. Neither from the point of view of readability nor of aesthetics there can be a single ideal face. Different designs are more and less readable at different sizes, and in different media, such as print and screen. And what aesthetics is desirable will depend on your audience, the content of the document, and on cultural factors, which change with the times.</p>
<p>Even from the point of view of readability in terms of comfort and reading speed, aesthetics is also a major factor, because whether the reader is motivated to read is one of the biggest factors in readability. Both the content—how well written the material is—and the visual aesthetics of the experience are extremely important, as well as whatever burden typeface design puts on the decoding process. And that is assuming the content is of interest to the reader.</p>
<p>I do think that as far as design that puts the least burden on the decoding process, there are some fairly narrow windows for what is ideal at a given size. But this allows for a great deal of flexibility on aesthetics. And furthermore, in display type aesthetic considerations are usually more important than ideal reading comfort or speed.</p>
<p>David Berlow&rsquo;s [[http://www.aiga.org/cyrus-highsmith-on-david-berlow/|shepherd story, as related here by Cyrus Highsmith,]] is pretty much on target.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Jennifer ,
I am trying to grasp where you are going with this?  There are numerous philosophy writings on perfection and the like which can take you around the mountain long enough to give up on the concept in general.
Anything that pertains to &ldquo;like or admire&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean much more than the Miss America Pageant or Queen of the Senior Prom.  If you are after a more functional way of looking at things then you really need to spell out your criteria much better.  Even if you raise the banner of readability, you have quite a job to define the parameters well enough to allow comparison.  I am sure you don&rsquo;t just want a &ldquo;Top Ten List&rdquo; in the vein of late night TV shows.</div>
