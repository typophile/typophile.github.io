  in their design. But when some fonts like Futura, Palatino etc are similar between
  different foundries. Does the final choice of the same come down to the foundry?
  Do designers actually prefer a few foundries? If so which would be your primary
  one for your source of fonts? Also are they not cheating people by selling the same
  font under different companies?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nYes usually they go where they can get consistent quality and style...
    price is becoming less of an issue. You pay what the man wants.\r\n\r\nThe most
    original source or the foundry with the best quality assurance. You have to do
    your due diligence and comparison shop. Many type designs that are sold are public
    domain-this allows a foundry to release fonts based on designs some else is selling.
    Actually the big foundries cheat you by price fixing!"

  body: What it does mean is that a foundry is free to access a historical source
    and use that as reference to build a font family like other foundries have.

    and changed one word in it (or even one character's name -- Hermione to Hilda,
    for instance) do you think you could pass it off as an original? Same with fonts.
    You can base your story in the same genre, wizardry and such, but you can't use
    Rowling's characters or storylines, and more than you can copy characters from
    a font and call it your own."
