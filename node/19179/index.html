  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>What exactly constitutes a font licence transfer? For instance, my friend recently bought a used Apple Powerbook G4 with 1000 fonts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->already<!-- raw HTML omitted --> installed. Who owns the font licence now? Is it the previous owner’s or my friend’s responsibility to delete the fonts from the hard drive?</p>
<p>How do you <!-- raw HTML omitted -->usually<!-- raw HTML omitted --> transfer a licence? Is there a common ground here?</p>
<p>I had a quick look through some of the EULAs on disk and I admit I was perplexed by the legal-lingo and general lack of standardisation regarding licence transfer.</p>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think licenses can be transferred whatsoever, as the user is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->granted the permission to use<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the fonts, but doesn&rsquo;t actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->own<!-- raw HTML omitted --> them. Common logic tells us you can&rsquo;t transfer what you don&rsquo;t own. If another end user wants to use those same fonts, he needs to purchase his own license.</p>
<p>It was the previous owner&rsquo;s responsiblity to delete the copies of the fonts from his hard drive before selling the computer to your friend. But it&rsquo;s your friend&rsquo;s responsibility <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to use said copies of fonts &ndash; if he does, he is liable for prosecution.</p>
<p>Anyone, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>

<p>P.S. I advised my friend to do a fresh install of OS X  thus losing all previous font data but it did raise the question on how licence transfers occur.</p>

<p>Seems rather simnple, I think.</p>
<p>Your friend can keep using the Monotype* fonts on the purchased computer as long as:</p>
<ol>
<li>The seller was the real licensee of the fonts on his computer before he sold the machine.</li>
<li>The seller deletes all other copies of the fonts he has, including copies he may have installed on other machines.</li>
<li>Your firend agrees to abide by all of the Monotype EULA&rsquo;s terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, your friend must delete all the Monotype fonts on his new computer himself. He did not purchase a license for them, and does not have one simply through acquisition of the computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Other foundries and other fonts might have differnt EULA restrictions regarding license transfers. You friend must check up after all 1000 of the fonts.</li>

<p>I think it&rsquo;d be still quite risky to use them as we are not absolutely sure if the seller had really licenced them, for all we could know he/she could&rsquo;ve downloaded them illegally online. This was basically the reason why I told my friend he should just reformat.</p>

<p>If you bought the computer on ebay, clean it. Forget it. If you bought the computer from a colleague or close friend, just ask if the font licenses were included in the selling price.</p>
<p>(Of course, it isn&rsquo;t simple at all in the buyer&rsquo;s sense… if the fonts are legit, he still has to look at the EULAs for each foundry to see whether or not he can even have possibly purchased the license from the orginal owner or not.)</p>

<p>Be warned, that chart is not perfect. As I was writing the article, foundries were writing to me to tell me they were changing things. It felt good to know I was stirring the pot.</p>
