    typeface used in the publication. The zeros used in the '1870' of the headline
    and the '20' suggest a common typeface.\r\n\r\nHope this clears things up. Thanks
    for any correspondence."

    might try Eastlake:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EastlakeBySolotype_5834.jpg]\r\nThere
    is a <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/eastlake/\r\n<a href=\"http://www.identifont.com\">digital
    revival of Eastlake</a> by Solotype that could be edited to make a pretty close

  body: "Should have mentioned about Eastlake that the 19th century font had an uppercase
    and numbers  only. Solotype has a fairly accurate recreation of them but Dan X.
    Solo added a lowercase which is less than fully appropriate to an 1879 design.
    A better match might be the lower case to Lightface Celtic, designed at almost
    the same time as Eastlake. They are an appropriate fit in all respects, except
    that they are not monoline like Eastlake. Most people would barely notice this.
    \r\nLightface Celtic is digitized as <a href=\"http://buystufffrom.jessicahische.com/product/brioche-font
    \">Brioche</a>. Here is the Brioche lowercase width narrowed to match the Eastlake
    uppercase. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BriocheLCwidth@80percent_4390.jpg]\r\nOnly
    the lowercase k needs editing to replace a swash with a regular serif.\r\nDon"

  body: "For the headline condensed sans, I wasn't able to spot a good alternative
    that could be close enough to both letters and digits. Actually, it came for nothing
    for the digits. So, here are only some I like for the headline sans: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/garage-gothic|Garage
    Gothic FB]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans|Nimbus Sans]] Condensed
    Bold (probably the \"closest\" but /R leg terminal needing to be straightened
    and /1, /2 and /8 reworked), [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Dense-typeface/10231891|Dense]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/cheap-pine|Cheap Pine]] Sans (nice vintage
    treatment), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/newhouse-dt|Newhouse DT]]
    Super Condensed Bold (quite same work as Nimbus Sans), [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/overview|Knockout
    HTF]] (cf Nimbus Sans), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/placard-mt|Placard
    MTI]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/poster-sans|Poster Sans]] (squooshing
    it), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/rama-gothic|Rama Gothic]] (NS), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/gothic-rr|Gothic
    RR]]\r\n\r\nFor the serif, 2 similars: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/chambord|Chambord]]
    (very nice this one), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/versailles|Versailles]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jagjagvi/old-earthy|Old Earthy]]\r\n\r\nMay be
    having a look to [[http://waldenfont.com|Walden Font Co.]] collections would worth
    a shot too. Even if it's a US poster specialist, I guess some fonts could fit
    your needs."

  body: Always a pleasure, Don. I'm learning so much since you're here. Unfortunately,
    found no font with such a /8 or at least, may be only /8 so can't even remember
    it... May be one from Walden, Bellofatto...

    explanations. But, hey, nobody is forced to read them :)\r\nBTW Walden is great
    for finding the obscure and interesting. Too bad they never went the next step
    and engineered clean versions from their autotraces.\r\nAs for 8, this is what
    I love about 19th century typography. It goes in every direction and there is
    no canon of how letter forms are required to look. This 8 just does not fit the
    standard templates we now use.\r\nDon"
