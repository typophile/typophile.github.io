    seen you somewhere before?&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;I was a famous Centaur once. Joanna
    know what happened? Italia what happened. The Air Force took a Janson me. They
    put me in charge of Arial maneuvers. The DIN was terrible. I said &#39;Avant Gardes
    posted Ronda clock!&#39; They said, &#39;This Stymie went too far.&#39; Well,
    no more Beton Ronda bush. I made some Eras. They cost me my Courier. Univers see
    it until it&#39;s too late. Bodoni hurts when I laugh. Now, I spend my Times Roman
    the streets.&#34; <BR> <BR>I wondered Weidemann was saying all these crazy things.  <BR>
    <BR>Franklin, I don&#39;t give a Dom. <BR> <BR>&#40;My apologies. Please don&#39;t
