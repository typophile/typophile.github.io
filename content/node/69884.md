  a single weight, then later want the whole font family will receive a discount to
  the sum of the original purchase. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know the foundry of which
  I speak?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nHarley\r\n\r\n"

    want to later upgrade to a pack or family that contains the single we'll take
    off the original purchase price. You can also upgrade from packs to families ...

  body: MyFonts did this for me just last week. I ordered a few weights of a font
    and then discovered I needed the full family. I was able to purchase the family
    price and have my previous invoice cancelled.
