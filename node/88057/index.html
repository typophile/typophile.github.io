Metalica is a futuristic, techno-looking and expressive typeface with an appearance of metal-like parts with some very sharp edges.

Be careful... don't cut yourself.

Comes in 5-flavors: Roman, Slant, Swash, Ornamental & Outline.

Please let me know if you like it. Thanks.</div>

It has just come to my attention what this is all about.

I had no idea of the "band" Metallica. I guess being 60 gives away my ignorance.

Anyway, I simple mistake on my part.

When I designed the fonts they reminded me of METAL.

So I just added the "ica" at the end of name to make it sound interesting.

I will remove fonts immediately and come up with a better name.

Thanks for the heads-up on the matter.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yeah... music like "The Doors", "The Who".

I listened to the "cello" Metallica link, interesting (not bad), and I found the comments entertaining.

Seriously, this font-name-picking-business is getting harder than designing fonts.

All the good names have been taken... something like 350,000 + fonts.

It's getting to the point that we have to make up names. Maybe just alpha numeric "XLR 500" to be safe.

By-the-way, any good suggestions for a new name? Much appreciated.

We should have a specific forum for dealing with "font naming" issues.

Can someone please make a "font-naming" generator.

They have one for generating music band names...

http://b10m.swal.org/cgi-bin/bandname.cgi

Anyway, I should have realized, the name sounded too cool. Probably came from somewhere in my subconscious mind.</div>

Twombly once said the same, adding an implication that
many who have taken names she would have liked to use
are not worthy. I couldn't agree less, on both counts.

>frode frank—"Heavy Duty" sounds good too.

>Sindre—good idea, if I can't pick from one of these 5 names I'll start looking at metal "types". Thanks.

I put together a final list of 5 names that I really like.

If you google the first 3 there are references to other products.

Rogueblade and Heavy Duty seem safe choices.

I really like "Darkblade" because the swash ornamental serifs on the capitals resembles a dark blade or spear.

Is it okay to use "Darkblade"? General consensus, please.</div>

Alex: “alphanumeric” titling has been well done by Autechre, but AFAIK not yet applied to typefaces.
Perhaps foundries are wary that there may be some technical glitch lying in wait (I recall the trouble that Eras once had, when some apps wouldn't recognize font names with less than five letters!)

Unobtanium (from the <em>Avatar</em> movie) was a brilliant groaner.
And the classic Dilithium crystals, of course.

		<div class="commentbody">>Good point Nick. Postscript fonts work on the "5-3-3" rule for proper naming. I can anticipate the issues with font names less and 5 characters long to begin with.

I'm working on a new family of fonts with a multitude of weights and variations.

I've studied what other type designers are utilizing for font naming schemes and solutions.

TypeName-A SER 500, Typename-B SLB 600, and so forth (A, B, etc could imply variations in body proportions, or whatever).

Question: Is this a good idea or practice? I mean using hyphens, and other such stuff?

I like the idea of using acronym to shorten and abbreviate words like "Serif" or "Slab", etc.

I'm currently trying to figure out my own strategies going forward.

It would be interesting to hear what others think on the matter.

Any ideas or suggestions welcome. Thank you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I love "Plaxo." It works with the font. 

But to get back to the original debate, one of the most respected and influential alternative rock bands on the current music scene -- Radiohead -- stole their name from the title of a 1986 Talking Heads song. Catherine Wheel (the band) lifted its name from the title of a 1981 Twyla Tharp dance piece. Even the Rolling Stones riffed their name from an old Muddy Waters song. I'm sure there are many other examples of this kind of artistic "homage." 

I'm not sure what the legal precedent might be if you employ the name "Metalica" for a font family that could never be confused with a metal band -- especially since you've spelled your family with one "L" and the band spells its name with two. But if you like the name, you might consider consulting an intellectual property attorney before abandoning it.

But they weren't  neologisms, it was a cliché when Muddy used it (a rolling stone gathers no moss), and catherine wheel was a firework, among other things, and originally a saint’s martyrdom.

It's also spelled differently and in a completely different market. On the other hand, "Radiohead" is an invented word, taken from a copyrighted song title.

I'm not suggesting that Mr. Kaczun is free and clear regarding the use of the word, only that similar examples exist and it may be worth exploring.

You really think that someone is going to get confused by a 'font' with the name 'Metalica' over the band in question.

No, I don't think so. But Ulrich has the time and money to sue whenever the mood suits him.

So, I'll stay clear of that one. As I said before, who needs the aggravation. Not me!

And like Nick says... I've removed a space from a word, or concatenated two words, or named a font after a movie.

Who really cares? Apparently only the people that want to make a federal case out of it.

I wish that everyone would just apply a little more common sense, in matters of this nature.

I could understand if someone in the type business named one of their font families "Hairvetica".

That would definitely cause some confusion, and that definitely would be wrong. However funny.

The two are unrelated -- they're in different product categories. Mr. Kaczun implies no connection to the band, heavy metal or any genre of music whatsoever. With all of that said, you're certain that litigation would be inevitable? What would the basis of this suit be, that your made-up word for a product is similar to our (different) made-up word in an unrelated product category? I'm not a lawyer, but that seems a bit flimsy.

As Mr. Rowan points out, there is a band named Pantera. There's also a font named Carouselambra, an invented word that's also the title of a Led Zeppelin song. The song predates the font by several decades.

Happy holidays, everyone.

After all, they sued Guerlain over a perfume, and won. At least, that’s what I read on the interweb.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick> I have always found your comments helpful, informative, entertaining and thought-provoking.

But, sometimes, especially at the top of this post, first reply... Expect a call from Mr. Ulrich's lawyer…

I almost fell off my chair.

I had no idea what you were talking about. Nor, who this 'Ulrich' guy was or anything.

It was only after I got an email from someone else offering more background information and pointing out the similarity of my font name to the band 'Matallica' did I get the full scope of the issues.

If you are going to say something... please say it in a way that is instantly understandable. I would find this more helpful. Thanks again for the heads up in the matter. Much appreciated.

You are right, I've done some checking, apparently this band does have a notorious reputation for suing anyone over it's b(r)and name.

I guess what this all comes down to, is that we all have to educate ourselves more with this sort of thing, and come to a general consensus when it's okay to incorporate someone else's trademarked 'name' into your new product, even unrelated, and when it's best to stay clear.

I certainly have learned a lot from this thread... thank you all.

There are however, no clear guidelines in the matter.

It's this 'grey area' that can get us into trouble. I think we all have been bitten by this, at one-time-or-another.

Then *I* would fall off my chair out of boredom.
