body: "Alright, so I already know that this is actual calligraphy and I know who wrote
  all of it. However, I'd like to see if there is a font very similar to this because
  the project I'm working on would be much easier if I had a font rather than to handwrite
  everything. I know I'll lose some of the extra flair, but maybe I could mix some
  handwriting with some font. I just really need a good starting font that is as similar
  to this as possible.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/foodie-wedding-invites-04_3656.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help in the right direction."
