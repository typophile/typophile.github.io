body: "I'm wondering if there are any practical reasons requiring that all members
  of a particular family should have the same glyph complement.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete
  example, I have a font in which the cedilla and combining cedilla have slightly
  different forms for uppercase characters, but only in the most extended versions
  of the font. Currently, even in the condensed forms I have created distinct glyphs
  for cedilla/cedilla.case and uni0327/uni0327.case even though they are simple copies.
  I've done this primarily because it allows me to maintain a single set of class
  definitions and GSUB code for the entire family, but I'm wondering whether these
  superfluous glyphs can be removed from the more condensed versions once everything
  is finalized.\r\n\r\nThe only compelling reason I can think of for keeping them
  in is that it will ensure that GIDs remain consistent throughout the family. This
  occurs for more glyphs than just cedilla, so even if the glyphs are placed at the
  end of the font there is no way to get consistent GIDs if these glyphs are removed.
  I'm wondering, though, if this is actually something one needs to be concerned with.\r\n\r\nI'm
  interested in this mainly from a theoretical standpoint since the inclusion of a
  handful of unneeded glyphs is hardly a big deal. I'm just trying to get a handle
  on what sorts of things are/aren't important to consider when trying to harmonize
  fonts into a family.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    that someone has set a project in a regular width of a font, but the amount of
    copy requires that the font be set in a smaller size than desired. If the author
    were to substitute a condensed weight of the font, he or she would expect the
    font to contain the same characters..."

  body: "The inclusion of .case accent glyphs is merely a simplification in the font
    development process. The designer can place the glyph outlines in the .case variants
    higher than in the glyphs intended for lowercase letters. I.e. the difference
    between the caps height and the x-height can be \"hardcoded\" in the accent glyphs.
    Then, when generating composite glyphs, the designer does not need to shift each
    component accent in all the composite glyphs up by the same value, but instead,
    all accent components can rest at the y=0 position. Then it's easier to make changes.
    When I move the outlines of the acute.case or dotaccent.case up or down, the changes
    will be immediately reflected in all the uppercase accented letters, but the lowercase
    letters won't change. And in general, when using the .case approach, the designer
    only needs to adjust the x-position (left-right) of the components in the composite
    letters, and does not need to worry about remembering to set the correct y-position.
    \r\n\r\nIf we use the same accent glyph for lowercase and uppercase letters, then
    any change will require going through all the uppercase glyphs and making the
    change for each (and we need to pay attention that those changes are consistent).
    \r\n\r\nIn addition, those .case variants can be used \"ad hoc\" as a \"poor man's\"
    method to create additional composites while typesetting (through the use of kerning).
    Finally, this simplifies hinting a bit because we can define additional alignment
    zones just for the .case accents. \r\n\r\nSo it's merely a way to simplify the
    creation of composite glyphs. But of course, some designers may choose to do it
    differently. They can write a \"mark\" feature or use Python scripting to produce
    the correct placements, but the practice has shown that using the .case method
    is the simplest, and works even in font-creation tools such as Fontographer or
    TypeTool that do not have the more advanced features. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Actually, I just realized that most of what I've written applies to accents
    placed on top of the letters. For commaaccent, cedilla and ogonek, it is, indeed,
    less common to include .case variants (and the standard Fontographer 5 encodings
    do not have slots for these). \r\n\r\nIn general, I'd say, including a few superfluous
    glyphs does not do any harm. In OpenType PS, those will be compressed with their
    identical counterparts using subroutines, and in OpenType TT they will only occupy
    a few more bytes. I wouldn't worry about it. \r\n\r\nI'd even say: any methods
    used in the font for the creator's benefit (i.e. methods that improve the speed
    and consistency of the font creation) that do not IMPEDE or LIMIT the usability
    of the font for the user, are fine. \r\n\r\nOf course this depends on the font
    creator's priorities. If one's goal is to create a \"technically ultra-perfect
    font\", which is optimized to the point of perfection, the designer may choose
    to employ any optimization he or she wishes. \r\n\r\nIn the end, it's a matter
    of decision, really. "

  body: "<cite>(...) we can define additional alignment zones just for the .case accents.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt
    seems I lost this lesson. How to create alignment zones just for a partial set
    of glyphs? I just know that way, where zones are always global:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capture_01172011_001915_5658.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>FL
    alignment zones dialog.</em>\r\n\r\nI suppose alignment zones for a given set
    is especially important because overshoots usually are not the same between different
    cases (for example, I use 24 for lowercase, small caps and petite caps, and 32
    for uppercase, within a 2048 UPM)."

  body: "You can only define global alignment zones. What I mean is that you can have
    a alignment zone specifically for the .case glyphs, which are typically drawn
    way above the caps height and even ascender height, and by default don't have
    an alignment zone on their own. \r\n\r\n(By the way, I do think that the ability
    to define per-class alignment zones would be useful). \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, Adam. As usual, clear and precise.\r\n\r\nI imagine class alignment
    zones could be useful when doing automatic hinting in the situation I cited, with
    different overshoot for UC and lc. A global 0,\u201324 is not adequate to UC overshoot
    0,\u201332, I guess. I add a secondary zone at \u201324,\u201332 to compliment
    this difference, but have no idea if this has any real sense."
