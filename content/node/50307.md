body: "For reasons beyond my control I'm using FileMaker Pro 6 on an Intel Mac in
  system 10.4.11. I'm using Adobe's Cronos Pro  v.2.040, purchased as part of Font
  Folio 11, in a variety of contexts, including on internally published reports. It's
  not a requirement, but it is part of our department's look, and I'd like to stick
  with it.\r\n\r\nFM6 organizes its font lists according to scripts: Roman, Central
  European, Cyrillic, Japanese. (I'm not sure where other scripts fit into that ordering.)
  Fonts not associated with the Roman script don't display or print properly. For
  example, if I use a font that FileMaker thinks of as Central European, I get a \u0179
  instead of an \xE8. The issue is not input method; the result is the same whether
  I type the text or get it from the OS's character palette.\r\n\r\nThe problem is,
  FileMaker thinks Cronos Pro belongs with the CE script, rather than Roman. It identifies
  other Adobe Pro fonts, e.g. Arno, Garamond Premier, and Hypatia, as well as Carl
  Crossgrove's Beorcana, correctly.\r\n\r\nSo what's up with Cronos? Aside from upgrading
  to any of the 3 more recent versions of FileMaker, do I have any hope?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help,\r\nChristian"
