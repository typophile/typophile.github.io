    I went to get the link and came back to see that you've already posted one from
    Fontshop. I also forgot to mention that the example uses alternatives, most likely
    the Pro OpenType version of the font.\r\n\r\nThis is the Adobe link: http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=BIPQ10005000"

    sorry.\r\nBut it\u2019s included in several Adobe products, e.g. <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/CS3fonts.html\">Creative
    Suite 3</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=307069\">Apple
    OS X (10.5)</a> comes with [[Zapfino]], though only a TrueType version of it.\r\nF"

  body: "<cite>Where can I find the Bickham Script with alternates. Is there a free
    download of it somewhere?</cite>\r\nNo, it\u2019s a commercial font (<a href=\"http://letterror.com/content/value/index.html\">Why
    fonts cost money</a>). The alternates are included in the OpenType version, you
    don\u2019t need to get a special font for them. As I mentioned before, Bickham
    Script is bundled with several Adobe products. Or you can license it via the link
    that Andrew has provided: $35 for up to 5 computers."

  body: If you only need the regular weight then the link I provided will be sufficient.
    It's the Opentype version so all the alternates are included, provided you have
    software the supports the Opentype format (such as Adobe Illustrator, InDesign
    or Quark). $35 isn't a bad price for such a lovely and versatile script font.

    are included.

    not that a big fan of Bickham Script.

  body: "Hey Kassie,\r\n\r\n<cite>and it did not include the alternate fonts</cite>\r\n\r\nIt
    is an [[OpenType]] font (read the Wiki entry if you don\u2019t know what that
    means). There are no alternate <strong>fonts</strong>, but alternate <strong>glyphs</strong>.
    They all reside in that single font you purchased, I assure you! ;\xB0)\r\n\r\nHow
    to access them? Depends on your application \u2013\_that\u2019s why Asvetic asked."

  body: "Florian, you can access all of the opentype features in Illustrator that
    you can in InDesign. Kassie,\r\nfirst off check under Window>Type>Glyphs. That's
    all the characters in the font and their alternatives! Secondly, you can try Windows>Type>Opentype.
    This gives you access to all the Opentype features turning alternatives, ligatures,
    swashes and that bunch on and off."

    in this case \u2026\r\n\r\n[edit] Oh, I shouldn't underestimate Illustrator: There\u2019s
    an OpenType panel, too \u2013 at least in v12 and above. However, it works a little

  body: Hey Kassie. OpenType can be a little perplexing at first, but you'll get it.
    We built the FontShop.com character set viewer so it works just like the Glyphs
    palette in Adobe CS apps. There's a popup menu at the top with all the glyph sets
    listed.
