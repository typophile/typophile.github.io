body: "Lacrima is a typewriter like font family consisting of:\r\n\r\nLacrima Italic
  a very lovely swosh like serif typeface with little rounded (ink-) drops at the
  end of some of the lowercase letters and numbers.\r\n\r\nLacrima Serif features
  the uppercase serifs as well as the corresponding drops to some of the italic lowercase
  letters. \r\n\r\nLacrima Senza has no drops on any of the lowercase letters and
  no serifs in all uppercase letters what makes this font very handy for editorial
  or corporate design.\r\n\r\n\u2039ZZ_Lacrima\u203A is available in Extended Latin
  encoding, as Open Type format, offering support for Central European, Baltic and
  Turkish languages. Including many alternative characters and symbols.\r\n\r\nFor
  further information please visit http://www.type.xyz.ch/lacrima.html\r\nkind regards,\r\n\r\nAlex\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lacrima_mini_4925.gif]"
