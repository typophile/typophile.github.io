  font piracy, I have set up an anoymous <a href="http://www.quibblo.com/quiz/mTpSFr/Typophile-Font-Poll-Which-is-most-true-for-you-all-answers-anonymous">
  poll</a>, to offer insight into the the attitudes and actions of Typophile readers
  on this topic. The terms &#8220;Pirate, sharing or questionable&#8221; all refer
  to fonts not obtained in accordance with the font&#8217;s EULA. Please consider
  offering your answer so we may get a large enough sampling to deduct some meaning.
  It may not really conclude anything, but may be surprising.

    could define the term. \r\n\r\nI think for the most part, when related to fonts
    as this discussion is specifically, it is applied as a verb to the act of sharing
    or otherwise giving or obtaining without a license when a license is required
    to do so. As a noun, one who shares or otherwise gives or obtains without a license
    when a license is required to do so. \r\n\r\nWhat would the proper definition
    be?, and please don't mention eye patches, parrots, the letter R pronounced arrrrrrrr
    or any other of ye scalawag terminology."

  body: "\"You could define the term.\"\r\n\r\nPirate: One use abuses copyright for
    financial gain...typically reselling digital/analog copies or counterfeits.\r\n\r\nBut
    the term has been stretched immensely and is now used by the media and industy
    to refer to anyone that's ever listened to a song in an elevator or read a book
    in a libary without feeling immensely immoral.\r\n\r\nSo, for fonts: A mom finding
    some unlicensed fonts and printing 10 birthday party invites on her ink-jet for
    her son and a Russian site releasing copies of the Adobe Type Library with different
    names are not one in the same, and, as such, should not both have the term 'pirate'
    applied to them. I'd call the latter a pirate, the former a copyright infringer.\r\n\r\nIronically,
    in the US, it's 'illegal' for me to copy an Adobe font from a friend and use it,
    but perfectly legal for me to print it out, rescan it back in and sell is as my
    own font for profit. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "The mom may not know any better, but most if not all computers come with
    fonts that you can use, no strings attached. Curlz would probably be perfect for
    her son's birthday invites.\r\n\r\nThat said, of course there are degrees. When
    actual financial gain is involved (as compared to lack of loss) it's worse."

  body: to clarify, I'm certainly not saying 'the mom' is in the right. Just that
    there's many degrees of copyright infringement. The line between 'fair use' and
    out-and-out piracy is getting more and more blurred as well. Mom scanning a funny
    picture from a magazine for her kids is a far cry from me selling copied CDs of
    Veer Stock Photos for $10 each.

  body: So with [[http://www.quibblo.com/quiz/mTpSFr/Typophile-Font-Poll-Which-is-most-true-for-you-all-answers-anonymous|the
    poll]] ending in a few days, there are no big surprises. Most people seem to be
    honorable and good with a few less than admirable typophile denizens who admit
    to doing commercial work with stolen fonts. Not an extremely scientific poll and
    not a great represention of the design public since this was only posted on typophile,
    but an interesting snapshot.

    any say over their own fonts being given away would \"destroy links\" if possible."

    into it now, it would in fact be a level or two beyond just not pirating fonts,
    but looking out for others' work to minimize piracy (intentional IP theft), A
    noble effort indeed. In the season of giving and recieving, the less that is given
    and recieved that infringes on others is the best gift of all for those who try
    to make their living by doing quality type design. Merry Christmas- Happy Holidays-
