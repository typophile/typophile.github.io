  they chose to list under \"Helvetica's rivals\" were of British origin. A coincidence?

    born in the US, though, because Carter is a Boston resident.\r\n\r\nIt's a pretty
    sloppy graphic. You'd think this is one story the staff designers would like to
    get in on."

  body: "Times and Times New Roman were designed by Stanley Morrison in 1931 and 1932.
    Morrison is British (<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/510/stanleymorison.html\">born
    6. 5. 1889 in Wanstead, England, died 11. 10. 1967 in London, England</a>). Granted,
    Times and TNR are based largely on Plantin, so I see why you may say they're \"not
    particularly British\" but TNR is definitely made by a Britishman. It's probably
    more \"British\" since it was commissioned for the Times of London newspaper.\r\n\r\nOn
    another note, I didn't know Verdana was a rival for Helvetica... on the internet
    maybe, but not in print!"
