  his titles to Bande \xC1 Part. It's quite an unusual but really beautiful, chunky
  sans, anyone know what it is? The different treatment of the capital R and P make
  it a bit special.\r\n\r\nThe film came out in 1964 if thats any use, and a google
  search revealed sweet nothing on the font front.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "Since this is before the time of digital fonts, this may not be available
    now, if it was a typeface, and not hand-drawn. You might get close to this look
    by adding stroke to <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/spartan-classified/\">Spartan
    Classified Heavy</a>. That would have the effect of closing down the counters,
    although I don't think the differences between them would be as pronounced as
    your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
