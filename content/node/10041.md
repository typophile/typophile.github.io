body: I have these stupid Adobe Multiple Master fonts on my work computer installed
  left over from some Font Folio package.   <BR> <BR>I&#39;m on a PC and we run Suitcase;
  and Suitcase will not recognize or run MM fonts.  You just get a &#34;font activation
  error&#34;.   <BR> <BR>We&#39;re told the ATM version in the Font Folio package
  won&#39;t run on XP, so I can&#39;t run that either.  Plus you wouldn&#39;t run
  ATM and Suitcase anyway.  You&#39;d pick one or the other, and my company runs Suitcase.
  <BR> <BR>We also don&#39;t have TransType &#40;$100 SE/$170 Pro seems absolutely
  ridiculous for this software anyway&#41; which &#42;might&#42; make the conversion--if
  we had it. <BR> <BR>So...is there some other way that anyone knows of to allow these
  to run?   <BR> <BR>Any help would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: Although Windows XP has native support for regular Type 1 fonts, you need
    ATM to enable MM support. There&#39;s ATM Deluxe, and ATM Light. You can install
    the latest ATM Light 4.1.2 &#40;no charge download from Adobe.com&#41;, and that
    will do the trick, and still be compatible with Suitcase. <BR> <BR>T

  body: I sometimes work with Multiple Masters &#40;I&#39;m very sad that they are
    discontinued&#41; on a PC and in InDesign. <BR>As I use customized weight/width
    axes and optical axes &#40;!&#41; I need the possibility to set them. <BR> <BR>Am
    I right, that there is no way to do this without ATM deluxe? <BR> <BR>At the moment
    I have ATM deluxe and Suitcase on my system. I have to carefully look nothing
    gets wrong. <BR>ATM light doesn&#39;t provide any setting MM-Instances. <BR>Also
    InDesign doesn&#39;t allow setting except of using the optical axe in an automatic
    way. <BR>Is there any plugin that allows setting of MM-Values in InDesign like
    in Illustrator? <BR>Or is there a special version of ATM light that does allow
    to set MM-instances? <BR> <BR>Michael
