  be safe to leave the TT-specific metrics to automation. Apparently not the way to

  what to do. That How-To is quite dated, anyone know is it still valid today?\r\n\r\n"

    errors in them too so I'm wondering how relevant/critical these errors are? I
    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant

  body: "Assuming you are using FontLab try this. In the 'Key dimensions' panel, change
    your Ascender to 807, keep your Descender as -193 and keep your Caps height at
    697. In the 'TrueType-specific metrics' panel tick the box to 'Set custom values'
    and set the values as below:\r\n\r\n[OS/2]\r\nTypoAscender: 807\r\nTypoDescender:
    -193\r\nTypoLineGap: 200\r\nWinAscent: 950\r\nWinDescent: -250\r\n[hhea]\r\nAscender:
    950\r\nDescender: -250\r\nLineGap: 0\r\n\r\nHopefully this should work if I understand
    your issue correctly."

  body: "That looks pretty sound, Karl. However, if the actual ascender height in
    the font -- e.g. measured to the top of the lowercase d, the usual PS measurement
    -- is 950, then Topy might want to consider scaling his outlines down. At present
    the implication of 950 + 193 is that the total ascender + descender height is
    greater than the em height, which is usually not a good idea.\r\n\r\nTopy, note
    that 'TrueType-specific metrics' in the FontLab UI is a misnomer, since these
    OS/2 and hhea values also apply to PS OpenType."

  body: "Many thanks, Karl! I think I understand this, now both sets of values equal
    to 1000. I'll run a few tests next. John, what might result from having too large
    ascender&descender height? \r\n\r\nActually, come to think of it, the ascender
    value doesn't have to be 950? I just used it to control the leading. The max height
    of all outlines is 697, to the ascender value could be much lower than 950?"

  body: The value of the OS/2 typo ascender added to the depth of the typo descender
    should sum to the em height. So the values that Karl suggests should work for
    you. I would consider an actual ascender height of 697 to be 'cast small on the
    body', though. In general you want the actual ascender and descender height and
    depth to be close to the OS/2 typo values and hence close to the em size.

  body: What John said. I found [[http://www.kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm|Karsten
    Luecke's guide to Font Metrics]] essential in understanding this, having encountered
    numerous problems along these lines when updating fonts created by other people.
    It took a couple of read throughs and experimentation but once it starts to make
    sense it is invaluable.

    which I find a bit too tight. So how should I go about increasing it?\r\n\r\n\"In

    hard-headed, but why? What is the benefit of that and what are the dangers if
    they are not close to em size? I mean, if I don't know the benefits/risks involved,
    how could I ever fully understand this?"

  body: "The em is what is scaled. So, for instance, if text is set at 12pt then it
    is the em height that is 12pts high. So the relative sizing of the actual outlines
    to the em determines whether the font looks small or large or similar relative
    to other fonts at the same nominal size. If your ascender and descender lengths
    are significantly shorter than the em, the font will look small compared to most
    other fonts at the same size. If they are taller than the em, not only will the
    font look larger than other fonts it might also appear too tightly line-spaced
    in typical leading situations.\r\n\r\nNote that some software makes use of font
    vertical metrics to determine default leading, while other software uses explicit
    leading set by the user. MS Wordpad is a good example of the former, and Adobe
    InDesign of the latter. Hence, you want to set the vertical metrics to produce
    what you consider the desirable linespacing in Wordpad, but also to scale your
    outlines relative to the em such that your font is of similar size to other fonts.
    There is no absolute standard -- and there are reasons why one might choose to
    make an individual font 'small on the body' -- but general practice is to make
    the Latin ascender and descender heights sum quite close to the em height.\r\n\r\nHaving
    established the ascender and descender heights and corresponding Typo vertical
    metrics, you can increase linespacing by increasing the TypeLinegap value. You
    then need to also increase the Win and hhea metrics values by the same amount.
    Typically, this is done by either splitting the increase equally or proportionally
    across the two Win metrics values, or by adding it all to the WinAscent value."
