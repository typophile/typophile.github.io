body: Hello! <BR>I&#39;ve been doing some letterpress printing and experimenting at
  a printer&#39;s place here in my city and he showed me something very curious. It&#39;s
  a 12pt square type with a full &#34;Hail Mary&#34; on it. It&#39;s so small you
  have to use a magnifying glass to read it, but it&#39;s there and it&#39;s readable.
  We haven&#39;t tried to print it. I forgot to ask if the printer and owner ever
  tried. <BR>It&#39;s exactly like any 12pt type but instead of a letter it the entire
  prayer. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have any pictures of it right now... <BR> <BR>What
  I&#39;m wondering is, does anyone here know how this thing was made? Anyone know
  other similar things? <BR> <BR>Thanks!
