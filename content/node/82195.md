  body: "Sorry, but the fact is that slab serifs do not mix easily with either serif
    or sans faces, lacking sufficient differentiation from either.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if there is a large contrast in weight between the slab type and either the serif
    or sans face, then it might be OK.\r\n\r\nIn the past, typographers would often
    set the entire job in a slab \u2014 e.g. Cheltenham in the 1900s, or Beton/Stymie/Rockwell
    in the 1930s."

  body: "I think one does indeed need a weight difference to make a slab stand out
    from a serif (without resorting to a strong clash in style) but those huge serifs
    certainly make a slab stand apart from a sans! Especially when you consider that
    stroke contrast difference can also be leveraged (with both slab and sans capable
    of going either way).\r\n\r\nBTW Cheltenham's serifs (especially printed letterpress,
    like during the time period you mention) are too adnate for it to be considered
    a slab. I myself like calling it a \"Doric serif\" font. :-)  And I don't know
    about using Beton/Stymie/Rockwell for an entire job, but Cheltenham can certainly
    handle that with poise... not least because it's not a slab.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    adnate quality of the serifs is not much of a feature except at display size,
    although it does serve to soften the effect in body sizes, but you would get that
    sort of thing anyway with \"clean\" slabs printed letterpress."

  body: I have been looking at a lot of slab serifs and I haven't had any luck finding
    one with a range of styles. My ideal font would have everything from hairline
    ultra compressed italic, to extra black entended italic. I have found some with
    italics, and I have found some with a wide range of styles but without italics.
    I haven't come across one with both yet. Is there a reason why something like
    this wouldn't be created? Are there technical limitations? Or does anyone know
    of anything out there like this that does exist?

  body: "Kent, I like Salvo Serif a lot. There are a good amount of weights but unfortunately
    it still falls short.\r\n\r\nTrevor, Serifa and Univers is a great font pairing.\r\n\r\nI
    would love it if there were a slab version of [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100013|Knockout]].
    I may ended up going with [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100013|Knockout]]
    and [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100034|Sentinel]].
    Unfortunately Sentinel doesn't have a variety of compressed to entended styles,
    and Knockout doesn't have italics. I am thinking [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100032|Chronicle
    Text]]/[[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100031|Chronicle
    Deck and Display]] when I want to be fancy.\r\n\r\nI am branding a construction
    company so I think a slab serif fits perfectly. I would like to start with the
    slab and base my other typefaces around it. I like mixing different styles of
    typefaces. [[http://galp.in/|Tyler Galpin's website]] is a good example of what
    I mean. His site uses the font [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection/viewfonts|United]]
    that I mentioned earlier in this thread."
