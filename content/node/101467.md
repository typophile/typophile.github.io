  body: "Thanks so much. \r\n\r\nI have just used Goudy Old Style, but the diamond
    shape of the dots of the E does not match the points found in the period. I would
    like them to match and wish not to alter the typeface manually. "

    draw. would be simple to replace the round periods if the application is limited. "

  body: "Thanks so much for your answers!\r\nI can easily draw or outline and copy
    paste and am not the lazy kind. Was just wondering if there would be typefaces
    that would have it set with evenly shaped diamonds.\r\n\r\nHave a good night!"
