  sigining in South Korea, using Hangil E-Type for the English/Latin names.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Korean_Traffic_Signs_1_4457.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Korean_Traffic_Signs_2_5483.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  pictures were taken in Seoul. I\u2019m happy to see the typeface in use.\r\nDo you
  live in South Korea and like to make some pictures of the new signage for me it
  would be great! :)\r\n\r\nPieter\r\n"

  body: "Are you sure the pictures were taken in Seoul? Wondang-daero only goes through
    Incheon and Goyang to the west of Seoul, as far as I can tell. I've been looking
    for the new road signs but haven't seen any yet here in Seoul, to my disappointment.\r\n\r\nWondang-daero
    seems to have opened fairly recently, so it makes sense that it has the new signs,
    but I guess they're not exactly in a hurry to replace all the signs on existing
    roads, which is understandable."

    signing! :)\r\n\r\nPieter"

    signs using the new typeface visible in Seoul or other places in South Korea?\r\nIf
    so, can you send me a picture of it?\r\nThanks! :)\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: "I came back to Paris from Seoul three weeks ago after spending a couple of
    months there. Unfortunately, I have to report that I failed to find any road sign
    using the new typeface. I did pay attention to the road signs everywhere I went
    (mostly around Seoul and to the south and south-east of Seoul), but I had no luck.
    I even thought about going out to look for the sign in the pictures above, but
    decided it would be too much trouble without a car.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, they
    are not going to replace existing road signs overnight. In fact, one thing I noticed
    was that you still find lots and lots of road signs that pre-date the introduction
    of the typefaces that the new ones are replacing. But I also hope to see more
    examples of the new typefaces, of both the Korean and Latin alphabets. So please
    show us pictures, if you find any."

  body: Ah, that explains why I haven't seen the new typeface anywhere. I'm probably
    not going back to Korea for a while as I've only just come back from my visit,
    but I'll eagerly await the official introduction of the new typefaces next year.
