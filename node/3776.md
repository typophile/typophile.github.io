  body: I find the concept interesting. I do not exactly understand how it will actually
    be used? <BR>Does it require the typographer/designer to change the font <BR>version
    each time there is a change in voice, etc.or is there <BR>some sort of software/technical
    interface-ie a software translation from dictation to written word. Please elaborate.
    <BR> <BR>As far as forms- They do not flow together as is. The incision <BR>on
    certain glyphs look out of place to me. These are marked in orange. What about
    upper case? <BR> <BR>&#34;VOX&#34; is a nice name. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/29193.jpg"

  body: 'In Emigre Magazine #51, Andreas Lauhoff offers an extract of his MA project
    created at Central Saint Martins in England. The project illustrates the concept
    of speech-recognizing letterforms which add oral parameters on the rather static
    notation of type. <BR>I would recommend purchasing this copy of Emigre. A very
    interesting project.'

  body: Ideally, I envision some sort of speech recognition software making the translation,
    not the typographer. I am more interested right now in the appearance than the
    programming issues that are involved, however. I plan on presenting it as a Flash
    movie where you hear different voices reading text and see a simulation of the
    letterforms appearing &#40;as if they were being typed or recognized on the fly.&#41;  <BR>
    <BR>Uppercase is in progress but the semester is closing in on me fast...  <BR>
    <BR>I really like the incised letters, perhaps I should just try to make it a
    more consistent application by introducing it to other letters like the h, n,
    etc.? <BR> <BR>Thanks for the Emigre tip, I&#39;ll check that out.

  body: The Emigre article is a must read, so I hope you can still track down an issue.
    The simulation is done with HAL the computer from Stanley Kubrick&#39;s 2001.
    The rendering &#40;type&#41; is 3D. The work is absolutely stunning. Good luck
    on the project.

  body: Hey, great stuff with the angularity axis! <BR> <BR>But I think weight isn&#39;t
    Pitch, it&#39;s Amplitude. Pitch is &#40;inverse&#41; width. <BR> <BR>BTW, if
    you&#39;re enjoying making those superb fat glyphs, then it means you&#39;re half-way
    to being cut out for type design. The other half is being bull-headed. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: The amplitude issue is something I have stuggled with. I&#39;d been thinking
    that volume would be best expressed with point size. Relating pitch to weight
    was based on the idea that a higher pitched sound would seem more fragile and/or
    piercing. By the way, the other variable I am working to develop is inflection/stress
    through the use of obliques or italics. Any thoughts?

  body: '&#62; volume would be best expressed with point size. <BR> <BR>I agree, but
    that&#39;s outside of the font itself. You could say that Amplitude is proportional
    to apparent size, and that depends on point size, yes, but also weight and x-height
    propotion - like how ITC Garamond is much &#34;louder&#34; than let&#39;s say
    Simoncini Garamond &#40;at the same point size&#41;. <BR> <BR>Inflection/stress:
    Tough one.  <BR>Italics might seem natural, but I would caution against it, since:
    <BR>1&#41; Slant introduces Speed. <BR>2&#41; Cursiveness introduces informality/friendliness.
    <BR> <BR>I think Stress might be best marked with stroke contrast. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'I think the problem with the diagram and the pitch axis is that low pitch
    ought to be on the left, and high pitch on the right &#40;low notes vs high notes,
    looking more at frequency than amplitude&#41;.  <BR> <BR>In the case of pitch
    as seen here in weight, I wonder if there should be a difference in weight stresses.
    Should the bolder ones also have a verticle emphasis, with more weight on the
    bottom? <BR> <BR>Oh, and I can attest to her being more than halfway to being
    a type designer, if the other half is bullheadedness &#40;in the most positive
    way&#41;!  <BR> <BR>Aaron '
