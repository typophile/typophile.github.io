  body: Nice nice nice! <BR>Perhaps it still some problems of legibility, but it has
    a script feeling different than <A HREF="http://9031.com" TARGET="_blank"> 9031</A>&#39;s
    <A HREF="http://9031.com/p-font/preview/1020.gif" TARGET="_blank"> Bangalore</A>,
    <BR>wich was the only well-designed bitmap script font. &#40;was...&#41; <BR>&#40;Perhaps
    reconsidering upper part of the E and the diagonal of the M ?&#41; <BR> <BR>Good
    beatnik name too. <BR> <BR>Greg.

  body: changed the &#39;E&#39; and &#39;M&#39;. i think the &#39;E&#39; is improved
    but not sure about the &#39;M&#39; - may have been better before. <BR> <BR><IMG

  body: ' I think the change to the E is great, although maybe the M still needs some
    work... <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know about that &#39;r&#39;... maybe a more &#34;handwritten&#34;
    r would work better for me. <BR> <BR>I would also look into making the &#39;k&#39;
    look less like an &#39;h&#39;.   <BR> <BR>anyway, overall I think it&#39;s beautiful
    and I would love to have it  :D '

    contact my &#42;g&#42;&#41; at the &#39;K&#39; and &#39;R&#39; on the right downstroke
    have to go under the baseline. <BR> <BR>I think also the &#39;X&#39; and &#39;x&#39;
    need some work. '

    <BR>Andrew&#39;s suggestion for the lowercase R sounds good: <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/Testdrive?id=30134&amp;s=Kerouac%3F&amp;p=72&amp;submit=Display"

  body: Revised the &#39;K&#39; and &#39;R&#39; as suggested and tried out the script-style
    &#39;r&#39; - any comments?. <BR> <BR>i tried a drop shadow too - which makes
    it look very tactile, it would be nice embossed. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2811.gif"

  body: 'Hi Joe <BR> <BR>the drop shodow looks nice. Go on with both versions. <BR>
    <BR>&#39;K&#39; and &#39;R&#39; looks better now. Maybe you should try some different
    position for the &#39;lonesome&#39; pixel. But I think it is also okay in this
    case. Maybe try to make the right stem &#40;or bowl?&#41; need also 2 pixel.  <BR>
    <BR>The &#39;j&#39; looks a little strange. Have looked twice before I regonice
    that it is the &#39;j&#39;. Maybe thats difficult in a text. <BR> <BR>Greetings
    Jens <BR>BTW: does anyone has a good site with all the terms in english?'
