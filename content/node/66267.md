  So I could really use some help here from some of the brilliant typophiles here.
  :-)\r\n\r\nWe have had several PS fonts that have become corrupt over the last year.
  They used to work fine and now in Illustrator come up at the bottom of the list
  enclosed like < font name >\r\n\r\nOur work environment changed this year and I
  suspect that is part of it. We use a server based font management system. Previously
  we were using Freehand for layout and Font Reserve for management. Now we are using
  Illustrator for layout and Universal Type Server for font management. \r\n\r\nWhen
  I was asked to look into the problem for one of our proprietary fonts I first tested
  it by bypassing the font manager. I put the font in my home library collection (Mac)
  and tested in Illustrator. The results were the same as reported. I then reopened
  the font and the thing that seemed out of place was in the font info under encoding.
  For some reason at the bottom pull down menu for encoding where it says \"Mac script
  and FOND ID\" it was switched from Roman to Arabic. I've seen a couple other times
  where this has happened even with some commercially licensed fonts. Since Alphabetically
  Arabic would be the first entry I'm wondering if the encoding went haywire and so
  Arabic came up as default. \r\n\r\nAny ideas or similar experiences?"

  body: "The FOND ID controls what writing system (\"Mac script\") the Mac OS, and
    Illustrator, think the font belongs to.\r\n\r\nBecause there is a relatively limited
    number of FOND IDs available, Mac OS can automatically re-assign FOND IDs to fonts
    in memory so as to avoid collisions. However, it shouldn't change which range
    the font is in (Latin vs Arabic).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are tools that can
    be used to manipulate or correct FOND IDs.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest first opening the
    font up and checking what the FOND ID is in the physical file. If it's in the
    Arabic range of 17920-18431, change it to something in the Latin range of 00000-16383
    (probably in the upper 3/4 of that).\r\n\r\nSee also http://www.evertype.com/software/apple/fontnums.html\r\n\r\nThanks
    for using Universal Type Server, btw.  :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thanks Thomas. Hope all is well for you there at Extensis.\r\n\r\nUTS is
    good in many ways\u2026 especially for a large studio environment. \r\n\r\nMy
    only real headache was the transition. When the Extensis rep came out here and
    did the font server migration the results became problematic. Font Reserve, our
    previous font mgr., had apparently been set up so that fonts on users end would
    not only be managed, but actually copied to the server. So there were many times
    more fonts on the server than we actually had license for. Then when she ran them
    through Font Doctor for the migration, multiple versions of font were then suitcased
    together. I had to hunt through old version on various servers and media to cobble
    together what we were licensed to use. Things are running much smoother now.\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: "Huh. So, everything there is fine as far as I can tell. If you regenerate
    the font from there, and replace it on the server (remember, UTS will keep the
    old version unless you explicitly delete it), does that solve the problem?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    before going that far, did you try clearing caches and the like? Latest FontDoctor
    (7.7) clears just about every kind of Mac font cache imaginable.\r\n\r\nStill,
    I have to admit I'm baffled as to what could cause this. Feel free to try our
    good folks in Extensis tech support as well, though I can't promise they'll think
    of anything else.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
