  categorization like fontexplorer does? by that i mean like the 'new set' feature
  in the left hand frame of font explorer. it would so nice to see the folders you
  categorize typefaces into show up in the character pallette in CS apps. especially
  when you are using a certain set of fonts for a specific client and dont feel like
  scrolling through unuesed faces. i know turning fonts off would help, but still.
  why not sets in the palette?\r\n\r\n_will"
