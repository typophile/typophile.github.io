    read Machiavelli, (The Prince), to get an understanding of the activities that
    must occupy mercenary hirelings in any peaceful society, then Sii's a lot easier
    to ignore. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    kinda missed the broadside of the analogy there SiiO0ops!\r\n\r\nYa marked a 50
    year veteran, a native pikeman of the militia, nonetheless... as a mercenary hireling?
    No wait, ya done marked his Starling pike, as a mercenary hireling. That would
    qualify you as a bad Pike Marker.  It also indicates you might not like my next
    two families, Berdana and Sarial Killer.;)\r\n\r\nIn any case, HAPPY 80th Birthday,
    MayDay Mike Parker!\r\n\r\nCheers!"
