body: since there&#39;s an f ligature for every other letter with an ascender do we
  need f_thorn and f_f_thorn? just wondering... <BR>or maybe just being silly, how
  often would anyone make a &#34;ffth&#34; sound?

  body: It can be &#40;see in Icelandic names in particular&#41;, but there is usually
    a morphological juncture there, so I don&#39;t know if a ligature is proper. I
    haven&#39;t had time yet to check this in detail, though.
