body: Here is my current project. A full branding solution for Bravo AV. <BR>Client
  needed everything from naming, type design, logo, full collateral, signage, exterior
  revamped architectural detailing, etc.. <BR>At this stage we are fine tuning the
  type design and logo. A previous client Musa Design &#40;Musadesign.net&#41; is
  doing the exterior with my collaboration.  <BR>In my first posting I am showing
  Type design. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26318.jpg"

    AV, as in audio-visual.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26321.jpg"

  body: I think in the interlocking &#34;AV&#34; one if you place the &#34;A&#34;
    a bit more to the left of the &#34;V&#34;, and figure out a way to mesh them together
    with positve/negative magic &#40;instead of the gray&#41; you&#39;ll have a big
    winner. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I thought it was worth trying Stefan Kjartansson&#39;s Armchair Modern. I
    don&#39;t have it so I did a mock-up from PDF / screenshots to see if if would
    work before buying it.  <BR>It was nice but this job had to be custom. It was
    however an inspiration for the type design I did in the posting above. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26345.jpg"

  body: Maybe Sophisto has the style of the font you want and show at first. The B
    is same <BR>check <a href="http://www.psyops.com" target="_blank">www.psyops.com</a>
    <BR> <BR>or maybe a lineto or a Alias font.

  body: Hi Alejandro, we are on the same track...I did a mock up with Sophisto. I
    did not try Lineto or Alias. I have a few of these fonts but Lineto is a bit sterile
    for the name &#34; Bravo&#34; . Alias is nice but  <BR>not all there. Fontsmiths  &#34;Sophia&#34;
    was also a consideration. but it is almost too curvacious. I spent about $90 to
    discover this, &#40;for a single weight&#41;.

    O has been rounded out a bit from older version. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26370.jpg"

  body: Don&#39;t use a circle - too much like VAIO. <BR> <BR>A square &#40;but larger&#41;
    or a more complex shape like your A/V &#34;shell&#34; might work. Try putting
    it flush on the baseline too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
