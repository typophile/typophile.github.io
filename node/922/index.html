  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I just recieved a copy of Counter Punch by Fred Smeijers. I am very excited about this book and have been ejoying reading it. <BR> <BR>I have found his type - Renard - difficult to read and was wondering if I am alone. I keep finding myself looking at the lower case 'w' and hanging on it as it appears in the text. Also, the black color of the text is distracting for some reason. The overall feel I have is that the reading is choppy. <BR> <BR>I am no type expert and am not discounting Mr. Smeijers' work. I am just wondering if others have some experience with Renard and some input. <BR> <BR>Thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although I don't have your strange experience with the &quot;w&quot;, to me Renard is indeed a bit mannered. And even though I like my text a bit dark, I think Renard goes a bit too far. That said, one could see Renard as a mild experiment of sorts, and I think it's largely a successful one, so in the overall it's a valuable font. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think &quot;ugly&quot; is a useful word here, especially when somebody is discussing a culture he has no real nativity in.

Inautheticity does two bad things: it harms a culture, and it reduces functionality. <BR> <BR>Interestingly, some people think that the Latin alphabet has an element of inauthenticity even for things like English!

Me? <BR> <BR>I also wondered about English and the Latin alphabet. I can see a strong argument for French, Italian, Spanish and Portugese to mention a few Latin-based languages. They, in my mind, should be best suited for the Latin alphabet - assuming the culture that developed the Latin alphabet did a good job of creating a symbol system that matched their language well. <BR> <BR>Anyway, Hrant, do you have any samples of Irish written with the Latin alphabet that I could look at?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">{Take this with a <i>bag</i> of salt&hellip;} <BR> <BR>From what I know, Gaelic can be written with dots (more authentic) or with &quot;h&quot;s to mark where a dot is supposed to be (more technology-friendly). For the latter you can use Chris's nice sample text. But for the former you need a special font. <BR> <BR>This is &quot;dotted&quot; Gaelic in a Times New Roman (inauthentic*) style: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14354.gif" alt="gaelic_1.gif"> <BR> <BR>While this is in the Colm Cille font: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14355.gif" alt="gaelic_2.gif"> <BR> <BR>* Gaelic has such variance that &quot;authentic&quot; is actually very hard to qualify. Except it's pretty clear that the conventional Roman model for example isn't. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Big thanks to both Chris and Hrant for providing samples. Very interesting. <BR> <BR>And, Hrant, I agree with you in that how can I actually judge it? I know that my take on it is colored (or coloured!) by my cultrual bias. <BR> <BR>I must say, to view the Gaelic set in the Colm Cille face is very satifying - even though I have no idea what it says or any cultural references. <BR> <BR>BTW, I did not think you snapped at me. Thank you for explaining your comments, though. I just wanted to make certain it was clear that I was not calling someone else's communication 'ugly'. Although, I would defend Fred's comments in that I belive they were made in the pursuit of understanding and not as a criticism of a culture &hellip;etc. <BR> <BR>OK. Enough qualifying for this evening. <BR> <BR>Thank you again for the samples.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;it looks like he got himself a life. ;-) <BR> <BR>Not so much getting a life as figting for the last 6 months to hang on to the one I've already got. Office poltics almost got the better of me. But don't worry, I've still got a job and an appartment but it was a hard struggle. <BR> <BR>Now this is an interesting thread <BR> <BR>Officially (in other words, according to our beloved government) dots and dodgy characters have been considered backwards since the 1960s and Roman <b>must</b> be used in all cases (unless of course you're trying to sell something to tourists).  <BR> <BR>For me (but I'm not the only one), there are a few problems with this. <BR> <BR>1. Does the government actually know what it's talking about ? Or did it just go along with the cheapy printers who wanted to eliminate the cost of maintaining two alphabets? And as the present government is allowing/ helping the Irish language to disappear, why should anyone listen to anything they say about typography?  <BR> <BR>2. Nobody has designed (or even customised) a Roman font with the letter frequency and general uniqueness of the Irish language in mind. It's all very well to say that Roman works but, to be honest, setting GAelic text with it can be a bloody nightmare. The very poor quality of modern gaelic typography is shameful.  <BR> <BR>Chris, h-es are just grand but you wouldn't believe how practical dots are. <BR> <BR>Check out what Vincent Morely is doing here: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fainne.org/gaelchlo/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.fainne.org/gaelchlo/">http://www.fainne.org/gaelchlo/</a></a> <BR> <BR>It's all in Irish but just click on everything in the first section and see what you think.  <BR> <BR>Matha <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>If the dots made it any easier to read, wouldn't they have been kept?</i> <BR> <BR>In a perfect world, maybe, but when it's a group of non-specialists (who have a million other things to worry about in any case) making the decision, the principle criterion is going to be saving money. <BR> <BR>When the government did away with the dots and the bizarre, backward characters that were upsetting Ireland's printers, there were no national Gaelic language newspapers. Now there are two and one of them's just gone daily. Modern Irish Gaelic is notoriously difficult to set in justified columns because of its relatively very long words. Very often, you end up with two words per line with an enormous, eye-catching space in between. With up to 5 h-es in some common words, dots are extremely useful for this sort of work. <BR> <BR>All the same, because of the high 'h' content, this particular letter does play a big part in  Gaelic's visual personality.  <BR> <BR>Matha <BR> <BR></div>
