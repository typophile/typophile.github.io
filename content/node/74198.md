  is an expansion of Mynaruse Titling. It features script capitals and widely tracked
  and smaller titling capitals. Mynaruse Royale has plenty of character and, with
  its powerful and sharp serifs that draw the eye. Mynaruse Royale is useful in settings
  that call for titling with an extra touch of elegance, such as a storefront, wedding
  program or formal invitation.\r\nMynaruse Royale contains a number of OpenType alternates,
  including alternate forms for the capitals that are large, drop cap like capitals
  instead of the calligraphic script capitals found in the default forms. Additionally
  there are non widely tracked lowercase forms that work well with the included alternate
  characters and ligatures.\r\nThe lowercase forms are 80% smaller in height than
  the Mynaruse lowercase forms, so the families are not interchangeable, but they
  can be used together. The calligraphic script capitals could also be used separately
  as drop capitals.\r\nOpenType-capable applications such as the Adobe suite or Quark
  can take full advantage of automatically replacing ligatures and alternates. This
  family also includes the glyphs to support a wide range of latin based languages.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mynaruse-Royale-poster_5583.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mynaruse-Royale-Poster-OTF_6396.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mynaruse-Royale-Poster-Text_3713.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mynaruse-Royale-Quote_5621.png]"
