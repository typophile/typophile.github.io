  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi Everybody,

since you've all been really helpful before, I have encountered a new problem that some of you might know the solution to...

A customer wanted to use one of my fonts in Microsoft's 'Word' software (don't know why, but I didn't ask) and he noticed that -while having been generated at the same time with the same settings- the Truetype version works fine, and the Opentype version does show up in the font menu, but when typing with the font it displays another (deffault?) font. 
Has anyone heard of this problem before? Or is there some setting that I might have overlooked while generating the font? Or maybe is it in the 'Word' software, which doesn't seem like a design environment?

Hope to be hearing from you soon.

Thanks for your time and best regards,
Joe</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As I remember, we had a similar problem with MS Word when trying to have Gentium as both TT and OpenType loaded in WINDOWS\fonts at the same time.

So the first thing I'd check is to see if having only one version at a time installed would help.

There are a number of people who post to the build forum who might better know what is going on, after the *bump*, maybe they'll grind out an answer</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your reply Charles, I'll be sending this tip to the person that encountered the problem. In the meantime I have learned that the Opentype version can also be problematic when used on a Mac with OS 10.4.11. Do you know something about this? And may I ask what *bump* are you referring to?

Thanks again and best regards,

When your post had remained unanswered for a while, Miss Tiffany, a Typophile Froum moderator, made a post with only the word "bump."

The purpose of that is to move the thread to the top of the stack, so people will continue to see your post & perhaps be able to give you an answer.

I guess after I made the small note above, she deleted her "bump" post, as it had served its purpose.</div>

On topic: your suggestion seems to have solved at least part of the problem, but now I get error reports that say the font doesnt properly show and/ or work:

"In Word:
The font is listed (in it's style).  When I select the font, the resulting type in the font window and the document says dear Joe 4, but looks like a standard font.  It appears that it is not reading the font file, but is automatically substituting another font.

In Photoshop:
The font name does not even appear in the list.
 
In Corel Draw:
The font name appears in the list and the font works fine."

And also:

"Testing the TrueType format of the DearJoe Four font in my Win2000 system using Publisher2000 and get an error message saying the font is not available on my system, however, when I selected 'use it anyway' I was able to continue and use the font without fault.

Using the font in a variety of alternate applications I found the font to function as expected, without fault.

~however~

Testing the font in a WinXP system in Publisher2003 I'm experiencing similar 'not available' errors, however, I'm not getting the proper font when selecting 'use it anyway'"


So obviously there's something wrong with the font...
I have genereated the font the same way as I always do and this problem has never surfaced. I just can't figure out where the problem is. Maybe it's got something to do with the fact that the font has A LOT of kerning pairs, but please, if someone would be so kind to check this font I'd be happy to send the file to them.


Thanks in advance and best regards,
Joe
