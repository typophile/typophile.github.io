  heavy unicase font with the techno, squarish, grid-based squeeze that of late seems
  part of almost every contemporary pop designs. It works as the 21st century display
  substitute to tired last-century horses like Frankfurter, VAG, or the rounded Helveticas,
  Futuras, and DINs out there.\r\n\r\nCoconut and Coconut Shadow come in all popular
  font formats, with a complete character set that is loaded with alternates. Check
  out the character map for a real techno treat."
