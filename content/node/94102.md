  has now been downloaded more than 200 times. I am eager for any feedback on this
  tool.\r\n\r\nHow is the UI? Could the generated feature code be better? Are there
  features that are not generated correctly? Any bugs? Any suggestions for improvement?\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know what you think. Thanks!\r\n"

  body: "Maybe you can extend the description a little bit more to tell people what
    this is meant for. (I havent tried it yet, since I am usually on a Mac.) But from
    \u201CWindows application to help with OpenType feature development\u201D I don't
    get the full scope of this application. \r\nWould I use that for fonts without
    OpenType features? Or to check/modify existing features? Is there a main difference
    to the OT editors of FontLab Studio, FontForge and so on? "

  body: 'Sorry. I introduced the tool back in April with a different post here: [[Any
    interest in Windows tool for editing features?]]. It is a stand-alone Windows
    application that automatically generates OpenType feature code based on font information
    it collects from an AFM file and outputs that code as a feature (FEA) file.'

  body: "I am honestly not very familiar with VOLT, but I suspect that tool is probably
    more flexible and powerful. This little editor tool is intended to speed up the
    development of OpenType features in a workflow where another tool handles other
    aspects of font development. For example, I use FontLab Studio or a combination
    of Illustrator and FL to create the glyphs and make the font. I wanted a quick
    and easy way to automatically generate OpenType features from all those small
    cap, oldstyle, alternate, ligature glyphs I already created.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    any feedback you can offer. I'm looking for reports of problems as well as suggestions
    for improvement."
