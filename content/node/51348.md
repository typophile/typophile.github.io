body: "Back in the early 90\u2019s there was a free display face called Margaline.
  I used it extensive in high school then the disk I had of it became corrupt. Bummer!
  \r\n\r\nIt had a puffy sans inside of a tear drop. (exciting I know)\r\n\r\nDo you
  know if it still exists somewhere.\r\n\r\nThere was another face that probably came
  from a 1000 fonts for $5.00 collection. Rattascat Swash- or something like that.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  feeling nostalgic for my formative years working with type.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"
