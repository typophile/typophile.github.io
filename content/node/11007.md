  body: 'There&#39;s something <i><b>really</b></i> weird with this one. It&#39;s  <BR>full
    of inconsistencies. <BR> <BR>Note the hairline stems of the &#39;N&#39; and &#39;W&#39;,
    they  <BR>appear to be way too thin in comparison with the  <BR>&#39;M&#39;. Both
    the spine of the &#39;S&#39; and the tail of the  <BR>&#39;R&#39; look cramped.
    The serifs on the &#39;C&#39; are much  <BR>thinner than on the &#39;S&#39;. The
    lower left-hand serif  <BR>of the &#39;R&#39; is too heavy, and the bracketing
    of the  <BR>serifs is all over the place: from fairly rounded  <BR>on the &#39;N&#39;
    to almost straight on the &#39;M&#39;. And the  <BR>aforementionned lower left-hand
    serif of the &#39;R&#39;  <BR>even seems to jump upwards at the edges. <BR> <BR>Could
    this be... &#42;gasp&#42;... Mary Shelley&#39;s typeface  <BR>of Frankenstein?
    Arghh... the horror!'

  body: I&#39;m with Yves. Maybe it&#39;s Wal<i>bum</i>. <BR>Where does the sample
    come from, Kyle?  <BR>That can really assist with an ID.

  body: I figured it out....it &#42;is&#42; in fact Walbaum, just a really really
    really bad redraw, as noted in your first reply. I went back a looked at an original
    logo versus the eps that was sent to me and lo and behold, Walbaum. It&#39;s been
    squished a little and it has fake small caps, but it&#39;s not as bad as that
    mess.

    design?
