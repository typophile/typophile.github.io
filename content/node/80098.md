  listing and I couldn't track it down. I know I've seen it before and is floating
  around out there but after 4 hours on various type sites I'm giving up, thought
  maybe someone might know it here.\r\n\r\n<a target='_blank' title='ImageShack -

  body: Is this all you have? The t is a bit like the upright version of LHF's Cosmic
    Cursive, which is probably what you were thinking of, but I'm not totally sure
    what the second letter is. Also, it is hard to tell if we are looking at it face
    on or if it is angled away from the camera a bit.
