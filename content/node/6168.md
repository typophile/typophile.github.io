body: Just curious if there is a file of common FontLab classes anywhere online or
  in their support stuff. If not, I thought it would be handy if someone could post
  a basic starting place for kerning and OT features. I suppose after doing a few
  fonts that utilize classes you will have a class file you draw from regularly. <BR>
  <BR>Thanks, <BR>Randy

    Fast&#34; &#40;Technical Editor Adam Twardoch&#41;. There is an entire chapter
    dedicated to &#34;Spacing, Kerning, and Hinting a Font&#34;.

  body: ' Randy, <BR> <BR>I just posted the other day the OpenType feature file for
    the next release of Minion Pro. Although glyph names can&#39;t be relied on to
    be correct &#40;with our FDK we use &#34;working&#34; names that may differ from
    the final names in the generated font&#41;, they should be clear as to what they
    refer to. I think this would be a fine reference for some common class structures
    and how features are built--indeed, that&#39;s why I posted it. <BR> <BR> <BR>
    <BR>I hope you find this helpful. <BR> <BR>Thomas W. Phinney Program Manager Fonts

  body: I haven&#39;t really used classes for spacing and kerning yet, but making
    classes for OT features in FontLab is pretty easy. I just try to make several
    classes that capture similar glyphs, make one for lc letters a-z&#43;lc accented
    lowercase, one for caps A-Z &#43; accented caps, one for smallcaps &#43; accented
    smallcaps, one for oldstyle figures 0-9, one for lining figures 0-9, one for tabular
    figures 0-9, etc. Then when you&#39;re building features it&#39;s pretty easy
    to build a smcp feature that replaces the lowercase set with the smcp set and
    the lining figures with oldstyle figures, etc. <BR>Anyhow I hope that was somewhat
    helpful at least.

  body: Tiffany, I do have Leslie&#39;s book &#40;and would recommend&#41; which is
    mostly responsible for my deeper delvings into FL. <BR>Thomas, great thanks! <BR>Paul,
    thanks for that too. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve got my head pretty much around what needs
    to get done and how to do it. My lazy butt wants to save a few mouse clicks :-&#41;
    Thanks all.

    right track to begin with. Rather than using someone else&#39;s class file i&#39;d
    feel more comfortable using my own. that way you know exactly what&#39;s in there
    from the get go. it&#39;d probably be just as tedious to go through another class
    file to figure out how all the classes were built as it would be to build your
    own. get off yer duff and just do it randy! ;^&#41;

  body: Leslie just made some $$$ off this thread. I broke down and bought both his
    books on Amazon. Now I gotta head home and study his &#34;Bible&#34;.... still
    waiting for &#34;Learn,&#34; it&#39;s backordered.
