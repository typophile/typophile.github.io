  some advice.\r\n\r\nMy client has a logo already designed using Perpetua (for the
  main logo type). I need a matching serif and sans serif font to use for the stationary
  and subsequent collaterals.... and i didn't really want to use Perpetua (i dont
  like it very much, its so stuffy and old). i know an obvious choice would be Gill
  sans, but i don't like that font very much either (something about the question
  mark annoys me)\r\n\r\nplease help! i've been wracking my brains staring at my screen
  for hours.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance "

    you see nowadays for some 20 years.\r\n\r\nBesides this, you could use something
    similar to Gill Sans, or which has been influenced by Gill\u2019s work.\r\nThompson\u2019s
    Agenda might be an idea."

    and has a lot of character\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gill-fonts_6055.png]"

    a new typeface from OurType, called Edward, which homages Edward Johston (and
    Eric Gill) and borrows a lot of forms from their work. It comes in several styles."
