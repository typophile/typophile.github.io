  Texture file @ Imageshack</a>\r\nHi,\r\n I posted this a few weeks ago, albeit with-out
  *much* response.\r\n Can someone help me A) find a *free* version of this font,
  or B) create a TTF file out of this texture?\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n(P.S. - Only focusing
  on the Latin characters.)"

    the font, and how impossible it would be to do a good job with such a small sample
    size.\r\n\r\nVjrrtd.\r\n\r\nY"

  body: I am dumbfounded by the lack of values that would even generate a request
    like this! Not once, but twice! But it is only half as bad because they only want
    the Latin side.
