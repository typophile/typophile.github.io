So for the design I wanted something that looked deep south white trash hate group design. <br> <br>One of my friends suggested that hate and hating hate were different in that one the end result is bad and the other is good.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Ben <br>I like the idea of the Victorian type -- it looks kind of like a tattoo --not sure if you were consciously trying for that, but it's an interesting direction. It seems like everything I see in magazines about hate groups, skinheads, etc. always has some version of distressed heavy manual typewriter type, so it's nice that you avoided that. <br> <br>I think the style of the type is good / appropriate but I feel like the type needs to be bolder and stronger -- it seems a little too delicate / feminine now. <br> <br>Since you already have a vaguely tattoo look happening, what about drawing the type by hand (in the same basic style) so that it's obviously hand-drawn? <br> <br>I really like the swirly barbed wire -- you have to look twice to figure out what it is... that's nice. <br> <br>Good luck! <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>BB: <br> <br>I think both the broad interlocking "H's" and the "H's" sharing a stem work really well. Both have potential to be very respectable designs for a universal design community (this is what you want, no?). If you go with a circumfrance of type, then be very articulate with the type selection and try to keep the type very small in relation to the icon/mark. It should appear as a thin solid ring, rather than a spacious airy circle of type. Add more verbage (i.e. descriptors, locations, dates, whatever), if necessary to fill the space. It's looking quite nice</div>

<div class=commentbody>"Yes its a hate group that hates hate groups." <br> <br>But then you have to hate yourself! :o) <br> <br>And not to get on a whole debate about hitler, <br>but it's hard not to admit that the swastika flag <br>is a truly remarkable piece of graphic design. <br> <br>I prefer option 5 in your previous post.

<div class=commentbody>I see a couple people don't see the strength of the concept. A favorite tactic of bigots is to claim they are being discriminated against. When you ask them to behave themselves, they say you're being intolerant of their intolerance and cry "hypocrite!"

<div class=commentbody>I see it's double-posty time, so I'll use this edit to actually give a design opinion. I prefer the very narrow aitches crossing. It is reminiscent of other hate logos but still original.

<div class=commentbody>I think your idea for an organization of designers against hate is a wonderful idea. However, this name for your organization is a terrible mistake. Let me explain why. <br> <br>It shows a misunderstanding of the psychology of hate, and will be counter-productive. <br> <br>Psychologist Alfred Adler pointed out that the first step to anti-social behavior is to divide 'us' and 'them'. The next step is that 'they' are less than human and it is ok to hate them and use violence against them. <br> <br>Recently psychologist Steven Stosney - <a href=http://compassionpower.com target=_blank>http://compassionpower.com</a> - who has been one of the most successful in treating wife beaters and road rage, has pointed out that compassion and anger are opposites - and anger is a key component of hatred. Hatred and the accompanying anger impair a person's thinking, so that they no longer think in terms of problem-solving, but only us vs them, and whether to attack, defend, or withdraw. Compassion motivates you to understand the other person and act appropriately. When you understand the other person you can act much more effectively, whether it is to cooperate or oppose them. <br> <br>This is why 'hate the hate' is a terrible idea. It falls into the trap of perpetuating the stupidity that hate causes, instead of providing the understanding that leads to its cure. <br> <br>Ecclesiastes said there is a 'time for love and a time for hate', and I do think that hatred is functional physical self defence. It blocks the compassion that would make you hesitate to harm the other person, and as a resulkt you may be killed yourself. Aside from battle, I see no benefit in real hate. <br> <br>Hrant's views on this matter are in my opinion completely wrong, and would lead to a much worse world. <br> <br>I think that your chances of being effective will be greatly if you contact and accept guidance from existing organizations fighting hate groups, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center - <a href=http://www.tolerance.org/ target=_blank>http://www.tolerance.org/</a> - and the Anti-Defamation League - <a href=http://www.adl.org/adl.asp target=_blank>http://www.adl.org/adl.asp</a> . <br> <br>These have long experience in fighting hate groups, and have had notable successes. I am not saying you should simply be a wing of one of these, but you should certainly talk to them and get benefit of their experience before going forward. <br> <br>By the way, note the logo for Tolerance.org - not great but not bad. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>William, apparently you have no idea what I'm saying (wow, that's a first). <br> <br>The trap is to make hate an Evil thing. It is human. By coming to grips with it, we can control it, and make those whose hate is out of control more human, like us. In this way of showing compassion to them, we have a better chance of converting them to a "control mode". So basically you're saying: I hate the fact that you're like that, and that makes us the same - but I'm in control of myself - you can be too. <br> <br>Your view is entirely too orthodox and rigid, and is leading the world down this path of destruction we're seeing more of every day. Because it's religious, as opposed to pragmatic and human. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

BTW, i think you have mastered the White Supremecy genre. Any would do the trick. <br> <br>Whether you should, is a subject everyone seems to have an opinion about. (including me) IMHO you'd be better off just donating your time to groups similar to the ones mentioned by William. If you want to organize to help other designers do the same, you can do it without this approach. Maybe I feel this way because I'd be a little creeped out by joining an organization with a bonafide hate emblem. <br> <br>Plus, you will cut down on calls from klansmen looking for you to design insignias for their local chapter. <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>&lt;font class="dontLookLikeCrap">Your marks certainly do look real. Too real, I think. I see those and I think "run!" not, oh what's that text say? Designers against hate? <br> <br>I feel like this mark could benefit from some more exploration into what makes it look like a fascist/supremacist symbol. This is an identity, so I could see the current symbols interacting with more contemporary typography (as opposed to the expected circle badge). I think that this would more clearly portray the concept (as I understand it) and the body of people who will presumably fall in and support it. <br> <br>And support it they will, if it's done well. True hate is a terrible thing, and never ends well. People hating sin can be just as bad for humanity as people hating minorities. "Hate the hate" to me takes advantage of today's ironic culture. I say hate on a regular basis; "I HATE it when they don't have Swiss cheese!" I'm not deeply angered and full of animosity towards the sub shop. In this case I feel like it can be a great call to action. I don't see the purpose of this as attacking groups of people violently, but reaching people in a way that both says "hating is not acceptable by your peers" and also "here's what we can do." <br> <br>I think assuming off the cuff that Ben's hate group will be burning things and hunting people is a bit hasty. I support the notion. I support the design. Make sure it's accessible and shows its self honestly. <br>And good luck. <br> <br>Aaron <br>&lt;/font></div>

<div class=commentbody>hate begets hate <br> <br>I'm with William on this one. (although we've had some past battles). <br> <br>I do understand the mockery idea and how that could take away some power from real hate groups but it smells of Adbusters - which proves to accomplish little more then self-congratulatory behavior in a pretty package of half-wit. <br> <br>I honestly don't see that a group promoting hate to hate groups would solve anything - it would only provoke more hatred from those you attack - especially by copying their brand. <br> <br>I could see how it might turn into a who's looking meaner, and more evil competition. - unless the group of designers have better plans? <br> <br>Perhaps you want to describe your business plan here. I think describing your planned actions will help everyone understand what the point is and then we can critique the logo to see if it suits. <br> <br>nice symbol though - the last one - if you were a devil worshiper looking for a hell sign</div>

<div class=commentbody>Admitting that every human harbors hate makes you more capable of dealing with it both in others and in yourself. Pragmatically, it's not a matter of stamping out hate - that's impossible - it's a matter of reducing its effects on <i>action</i>. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the classic 1985 film "legend" taught us in the first few minutes that hate and love are in a very necessary balance. But I'm not going to argue philosophy, I'm a designer. I'd rather still argue that the name "hate the hate" does not mean "GO BURN SYMBOLS IN THE YARDS OF MEMBERS OF THE KKK AND THREATEN THEIR WELLBEING!" <br> <br>That's absurd. <br> <br>We all love catchy slogans, we love controversy (obviously, see above) and we hate hate. Woops, there I went with the H word, I'm just fanning the flame of violence and terror. <br> <br>On with design! Let's see some more sketches, and I agree we could use more words on how the organization might work. <br> <br>Aaron</div>

<div class=commentbody>usually I'm with you Hrant - but I really don't see how mimicking the reasoning and look of hate groups will reduce their actions. <br> <br>If anything mimicking them (by claiming to be a hate group yourself) proves that their actions are powerful and effective, in fact they should find it flattering - AND that factor is one that needs not to be propagated by this group, rather the actions of hate groups and results of their actions should be challenged (so that they may think for a moment and formulate healthier opinions) By going it your route are you not giving applause?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I really don't know, Tanya. It's hard to predict how different people will react to such a logo. But I do think there's something to be said for taking the "inclusive" route: by bringing "haters" into the fold (through the admission that everybody hates, but it's what you [don't] do with it that counts) you might reduce the "I'm better than you" attitude that can only aggravate haters. I think a great antidote to hateful actions is to point out that we're all the same deep down. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

Its all permutataion and combination <br>I really like the Idea of having a hate that hates the haters. <br>Representing India, i actaully know and have seen what hatred means. its a small word which <br>can go to greatest heights like war etc. <br>this rough draft is what i have interpreted it as. <br>i hope you wont mind having a look at it. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32330.jpg alt='"h"'></div>

<div class=commentbody>After a long time i am visiting typophile. <br>Reading almost everyones response, i agree fully with this concept of hating the haters. <br>few thoughts to add- <br>i feel the logo or the symbol should be a mirror image of the typeface. In case of "H" it will be the same. why? because hatred is a chain reaction. when you hate someone, (with respect to humanbeings) <br>the other person hates someone too.may be the third person may hate you. Its all permutations and combinations. <br>Hailing from a third world country, India I truly understand and have seen this small word 'Hate' grow to great heights of bloodshed and war. <br>A small word but too powerful. <br>"you give this word to someone and it will come back to you" <br>here is a first draft of how i see this logo/symbol as. i hope you would not mind me just racking my brain on it <br>please feel free to send your comments. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32338.jpg alt=H> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32339.jpg alt=H1> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/32340.jpg alt=H2></div>

<div class=commentbody>I get the point that hate is a natural human emotion, but I don't find "hate the hate" a particularly interesting or productive concept.

<div class=commentbody>&lt;font class="dontLookLikeCrap">Both anger and hatred are Godly qualities. <br> <br>Paul writes: For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate. <br> <br>That is, he hates doing evil. <br> <br>And in Rev. 2: <br>`Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. <br> <br>God speaking to one of the 7 churches, commending them for their 'hatred' of wrongdoings. <br> <br>As for anger, Jesus was angry at the moneychangers he found in the temple. Rather than making it a house of prayer, it was turned into an arena for profit. <br> <br>As Hrant stated and as the Bible shows, it's a matter of how you deal with your hatred and anger. It is a righteous quality to hate what is evil. The key after that though, is to not take vengeance into your own hands, which is what most people do. Rather, "be at peace with all men, as much as it is possible." <br> <br>Two other quick notes. Hatred of a person is not the same as hating what someone has done or does. Also, because most people deal incorrectly with their anger and hatred, it makes anger and hatred seem wrong. If the anger can be used to start something good, then that is the correct kind of anger. <br> <br>But with that said, the logo &/or name itself seems too ironic for me. I think a possible problem with a logo against something that it very closely associates with is the initial confusion, and even confusion after people find out what it means. It's smart to be able to find similarities with your opposition, but maybe this is too close? Ultimately, it's your call. However, it's not a logo I would be proud of displaying, if I were in the group, no matter how well it's aesthetically designed. It has lots of baggage that you probably won't be able to overcome. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>&lt;/font></div>

<div class=commentbody>so we're comparing this organization to the actions of god? <br> <br>If God and Paul had hate then we can congregate, advertise and propel some more?! With that example then you could say that Hitler followed a righteous path or any of the groups that hatethehate would target and it becomes a mute point. But somehow I don't think that's what the holy ones had in mind when its written that they "hated" - to become hate inc. and shower it on everyone you don't like hoping that they'd smarten up. For some reason I think that maybe god or paul had a bit more power to persuade. See, if I were a religious person and god just told me he hated something we were doing I would probably freak out and do what-ever he said. Will hatethehate have that power - nah. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I wrote that hatred and anger is often misused, and Hitler would be an example of an unjust hatred, as well as hatred misused. <br> <br>I don't think the examples provided advocate spreading hate through a hate group. While it might be fine for something truly wrong to make you angry, having that anger and acting upon the anger negatively are two different things. But I do think it is possible to have a just anger and act correctly. In the case of hatethehate, the anger is just. I'm just not sure promoting more hatred is the best way to go. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Is it not all down to a matter of opinion? <br> <br>"Hitler would be an example of an unjust hatred" <br> <br>In your opinion (and I'm sure many others), but in his own mind, I'm sure Hitler believed his hatred to be wholly justified, as did many of his followers. <br> <br>Just as, in a more contemporary arena, I'm certain many millions of the followers of Islam believe their hatred for America and Western values is justified. <br> <br>I don't think it's black and white, but equally, I don't think citing examples of 'just' hatred and 'unjust' hatred does anything to further the argument. As Tanya alludes to, it merely serves to highlight the similarities between people who hate -- 'justly' or 'unjustly'. <br> <br>Jordan</div>

<div class=commentbody>the top one looks like the house of <br>fonts logo, at a glance. I like the <br>base concept mate, but can't agree <br>with the mark in all of it's incarnations, <br>bar the top ones. Make it pink and you <br>will be talking. <br> <br>kris.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ahhh, The Hate!<center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif align=left alt=application/x-shockwave-flash>Hate's True Insignia<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/poodlespining-34783.swf target=_blank><b>poodlespining.swf</b></a> (255.5 k)</td></tr></table></center> <br> <br>If one truly admires the Hate one must not dwell within the confines of established dogma - but seek new and ill-defined order within the withered contradictions of the Hate. <br> <br>Here are a few excerpts from the Hate Manifesto... <br> <br>But all in all - hating anything, be it a sibling, officer of the law, spouse, a poodle, or bananna at sea... is equated with hating ones self. No other way around it - (maybe you can jump over Hate? I don't know for sure) inflicting Hatred will eventually conflict Hatred. <br>Hate is a state of confusion, non-illuminating and muddled. Hate Hates please and sorry and other nicities. Can Hate only happen by one's self? Or does it take a person such as Hitler? I don't think so! Hate must always be capitalized. <br> <br>True Hates: or things we Love to Hate <br>Sombrero Blankets tied in bows. <br>Toucans <br>Eddie Bower Leather Interiors <br>Hate Groups that Hate Hate (true Love) <br> <br>Ways to express your Hate: <br>DON'T! <br>This is counterproductive. You must Hoard your hate. If you express it you will waste it! <br>If you have to do something, cover your bed in scabby pillows and blankets. <br> <br>Continue these activites FOREVER and eat you cherry oatmeal. <br>You can stagnate far in Hate. <br> <br>But... <br> <br>Beware! You may be leading us all into False Hates, with your emblems of Hate. <br>The False Hates: <br>Do not fool yourself into thinking you Hate when in fact your Hates are FALSE and just a reverse of the "L" word with no possibility of leading to the PAM. Below are examples of the False Hate. The list is limited in <br>scope. <br> <br>False Hates: <br>Road Rage <br>Divorce <br>Some sort of offense similar to murder but not. <br>War <br>Violence <br>Betrayal <br>Death <br> <br>I have much faith in your abilities young Sychophant - but you may be misled with the dogma stated thus far. You are fresh and wise! I sense you have much to teach us. If you have further questions please ask! For Hates knowledge is endless yet limiting. <br> <br>The following are quotes I have collected for the Hate leaflets: <br>> <br>"Hey, don't knock the self Hate. It's sexing the hate with someone I love!" <br>>Woody Allen <br> <br>"We often hate one thing and despise another, not telling the hateful truth even to the gods." <br>>Maureen Stapleton <br> <br>"Hate things as you would have them Hated instead of as they are hated." <br>>Kenny Rodgers <br> <br>and finally... <br> <br> <br> <br>Revelation # 7 <br>Even if you do not feel Hate, the Hate feels you. <br> <br> <br>Sincerely PoH#1 <br> <br></div>
