body: This is on the EL GRECO CONGRESS CENTER IN TOLEDO building, I think I've seen
  it in little big planet 2. I've looked  on-line for hours but haven't been able
  to find an exact match. I don't care if I'd have to pay for it, I just want peace
  of mind. I'm new to this so I've pressed the insert image and file attachment boxes.
  Any help is appreciated. PS if it hasn't loaded the same image is on the bottom
  of this page     http://www.lanciatrendvisions.com/en/article/el-greco-congress-center-in-toledo-designed-by-rafael-moneo
