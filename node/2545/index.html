  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi Typophiles, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm designing a logo for a downhill bicycle tour company. After much consideration, I chose Leviathan Black Italic for the typeface. Currently I'm playing around with typesetting and could use some inspiration and feedback. Still in Black&amp;White/Gray scale and have yet to introduce shape elements until thoroughly exploring type layout possibilities. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In terms of adding a brand mark &ndash; the idea that keeps coming to me is some sort of triangle (either isosceles with a wide base or equilateral) which would represent the mountain as well as the company's stability in the industry. With the possible addition of a s-like bezier which connotes the winding roads and switchbacks riders enjoy throughout the ride.Other possible elements are a bicycle and/or sun icon, but I'm leaning more toward the mountain only to keep it simple. The many iterations of the company's current logo(s) are all over designed and visually disorienting. I'm still &quot;sitting for ideas&quot; in terms of marks, but could use all your excellent opinions and ideas about the typesetting at this point. Have yet to present  roughs to client. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks everyone! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ps - sorry about the JPEG, but I don't have PDF ability. I could post a linked EPS if that would be helpful. Let me know.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of the options offered here, I'd have to go with the second from the top. I think the lowercase italics has more of a Hawaiian flavor. The word spacing needs to be tightened between the &quot;n&quot; and &quot;C&quot;. The caps also seem to be a little too bold in relationship to the lowercase letters. You might want to try lightening them up a hair. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as illustative elements go, I guess the most obvious (perhaps too obvious) relationship is between the &quot;M&quot;s and mountains. A capital &quot;M&quot; looks like two mountain peaks. I would rather see something happen with the &quot;C&quot;. It looks like an arial view of a rider</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tim: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I didn't necessarily mean to create the &quot;C-rider&quot; from the current type selections. I was just encouraging some graphic exploration. I simply meant that of type choices, I like the italics. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->At any rate, here is a possible direction implementing the &quot;C-rider&quot; using the current type selection. If you were to clean this up a and maybe explore some other elements (i.e. motion marks, angled road lines, curvy road, etc.) it might work nicely. I rotated the &quot;C&quot; upwards because it implies climbing (up a mountain). I'm sure you can come up with dozens of similar concepts, all of which would probably be better. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Can &quot;Maui&quot; be treated differently? Maybe larger and stacked above (cheated to the left rather than centered, but not necessarily left justified).

		<div class="commentbody">Here's a few directions. Have at them. I'm having trouble in general with this logo I think perhaps because the company name has SO long.

How to elegantly integrate such a complex shape still has not come to the overworked little gray cells.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Tim, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the problem with the above is that there's no interest in the type treatment and there are balance issues. There is a great design lurking in this job. I've seen the vans full of tourists dressed in blue and yellow space slickers sliding on to cruisers as the sun rises over Haleakala. Quite a sight (the sunrise that is). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here's my suggestion: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think the reason you like laviathan italic is because it has a nice *bike logo* feel. I think you might continue to push Maui and Mountain in a mountain/bikelogo direction, and contrast cruisers with a flowing hairline script. That will set up a nice contrast and provide interest. Something like this: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You'd have to work out the proportions and overlaps etc. Also, I suck at drawing scripts, but you might consider something like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SophiaScript <!-- raw HTML omitted --> from Letterhead Fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hope that kickstarts the engine. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Randy <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->PS.

Not to oversimplify, but they look the best. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've been partial to the lowercase Leviathan Black Italic (#2) letterformss from the very beginning. As Scott said earlier, they have the most &quot;Hawaiian flavor.&quot; The forms of the lowercase italics (rounded &quot;i&quot; dot, one story &quot;a&quot; and rounded tails) fit the personality of the brand and client: fun, friendly, professional yet casual. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The same is true of Fariplex Narrow Black Italic. When I saw the lowercase forms, browsing through the Emigre specimen book the other night &ndash; they hit me like a ton of bricks. They also fit the brand's personality very well ,perhaps even more so, in that they have a slightly more quirky less formal feel. Fairplex has that Hawaii &quot;Upcountry&quot; style, which is about country living and true aloha spirit with a pinch of old western flavor for good measure. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->More generally, both 1 &amp; 2 pair better with the script than the others because they provide more contrast and visual interest.

		<div class="commentbody">That was my &quot;snap judgement&quot; (my immediate reaction). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taking more time to think about it, I definitely like the italic type better than the others, but the combination of italic and serif in Fairplex seems to compete a little with the character of the script. Leviathan offers just the right amount of contrast without competing. After reading your reasoning, however, there is some justification for the Fairplex serif, as it has a little more of a country feel compared to Leviathan. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->RE: Client Empowerment - I usually work with the client to define the problem (project), then I develop the solution with as little client intervention as possible. This sends two very important messages to your client: (1) project completion is simple with you on the job because you get it done without requiring much from them, and (2) you are the expert and they can come to you for the answers, not the other way around. As always, there are numerous exceptions to this school of thought, so being that you are the only one who knows your client, you'll have to make a judgement call. My ignorant recommendation is to consider the problem as you know it, then make the font selection. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aloha! <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott - thank you for the diplomacy coaching! Sometimes it's just a confidence issue. Especially when it's the first project for a particular client and you'r not sure how &quot;difficult&quot; they are. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tiffany, you make a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->very<!-- raw HTML omitted --> valid point about the roman providing more contrast and hence allowing the script to pop more. In regards to the stacked &quot;M&quot;s, I'm going to play around with alignment and also using one large &quot;M&quot; for both words or stacked uppercase &quot;M&quot;s which are more interwoven (ala Randy's sketch - see above). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm a bit torn on this at the moment. I'm going back and forth between the italic vs. roman at the moment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd like Randy to chime in, as this direction is based on his concept &ndash; which (by the way) favors uppercase roman (i think). But then again he did suggest Fairplex Narrow Black Italic once I brought that face to the table. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tiffany's on to the heart and soul of this concept. Contrast. The roman pushes that contrast even more. I think you will also be wanting übertight kerning. Keep it simple. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Randy</div>
