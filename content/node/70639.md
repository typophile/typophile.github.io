  hence being able to move in time. Please crit me on this! '

    with it...\r\nPerhaps something a bit 'friendlier' that is in function of the
    logo & doesn't draw all the attention to itself?"

    logo being two separate components. Posting the new version. how do you attach
    a PDF along with this reply? '

    a 826 Valencia store that we made up.  I made a \"Snow Ball Supply Store\".\r\nI
    would put more of an idea of time travel in your logo.  I don't get that feel,
    perhaps research a fusion of what makes travel, travel, and what images and motfis
    are \"time\".  This has a lot of potential.  Perhaps the direction clock hands
    turn could help enforce the idea of \"time travel\""

  body: heres the Jpeg, redone with 'friendlier' type. Any suggestions on colour or
    is black & the lines becoming more opaque appropriate? (staying with the space-time
    concept) [img:sites/default/files/old-images/blacklogo3_5683.jpg]

  body: "The new font is better. I like the style of the logo, how it's clean and
    clear and not sci-fi-like\u2026 feels more timeless than trendy, which is probably
    a good thing. Strange though: I keep reading \"eartrek\" \u2013 maybe because
    the logo seems more reminiscent of sound waves (or earthquakes, actually) than
    time travel\u2026 come to think of it, frankly I don't get the logic of the concept.
    If that is a timeline, then yes you're <em>bending</em> time; but to move <em>back</em>
    in time would mean moving to the left, rather than up and down, no? \r\nMaybe
    it's just me. I might try playing more with concepts of backwards/forwards; use
    arrows?; clocks?; play with the standard left-to-right reading direction? Bend
    the time we spend reading the logo (backwards type? flipped letters? upside down?)
    Maybe you've already explored all this, but there seems to be so much to play
    with that might make the application clearer than what you have now. \r\n(Props
    to your teacher too, this seems a really fun assignment.)"
