    that is popping up here and there called Fashion Thin is similar, but it\u2019s
    not very good. I\u2019m working on something similar as well, but I never seem
    to get around to finishing it."

  body: "it was the left part of the <strong>P</strong>\r\n\r\nbut also the <strong>I</strong>
    (in QUI) that melts together with <strong>L</strong> (in MAL) that made me think
    it was handpainted..\r\n\r\ny'see..  I had a girlfriend once (yes..  it is true!!)
    who made me paint texts on T-shirts for her like this one. MENSCH! that was hard
    work..  however the bonus was when she took of the T-shirts..  so I should not
    complain."
