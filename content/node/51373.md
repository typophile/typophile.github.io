  some odd reason I thought this typeface was stripes but after closer examination
  I realize it wasn't. So any info on what typeface this is I would truly appreciate

  body: This is custom lettering. It would take a very intelligent font -- or one
    with many ligatures -- to have different connections for each of these letter
