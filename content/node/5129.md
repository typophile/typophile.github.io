body: I am looking for some feedback on this lettering. I only have about 2 hours
  max to finish this. <BR> <BR>It is for a rural farming community that needs to pass
  a bond issue to save some farming land. It will be used on a poster. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: 'I like the style, the colors, and the balancing. <BR> <BR>I would make the
    bottom serif of the &#34;C&#34; totally straight &#40;not leaning a bit forward&#41;,
    and make the tail of the first &#34;R&#34; longer. Plus maybe adjust for weight,
    if you have time: the larger the letter the more slimming it needs - or vice versa.
    <BR> <BR>And there&#39;s a bit of wobbliness in some outlines, like the inside
    bottom-right of the &#34;S&#34;, the body-shadow relationship in the &#34;C&#34;,
    etc. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Sean -- nice start ... just a few things ... <BR>might be more subjective
    than anything. <BR> <BR>&#42; the C seems a tad too big/heavy <BR>&#42; the leaf
    on the tip of the S gets obscured <BR>when you stroke it ... could it be bigger?
    <BR>&#42; actually, the O looks a little big, too. <BR> <BR>bj <BR>

  body: The shadow&#39;s distribution seems odd to me. <BR>It&#39;s too dark on the
    middle &#40;&#39;rrale&#39;&#41;. Both beginning and ending letters need a little
    more shadowing &#40;especially the &#39;C&#39;&#41;.  <BR>Overall, I think it
    looks nice, but I wonder if the flourish in &#39;S&#39; isn&#39;t too detailed.

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Thanks for the critique. I
    think all your comments are right on. I&#39;ll be making those changes. Extra
    sets of eyes are great! <BR> <BR><i>And there&#39;s a bit of wobbliness in some
    outlines, like the inside bottom-right of the &#34;S&#34;</i> <BR> <BR>&#34;S&#34;s
    are so hard for me to draw! They take me forever and I never get them quite right.
    Any suggestions to help me work through this in general? <BR> <BR>Thanks a bunch
    for the help! <BR> <BR>S.&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: Looks great, almost like a magazine masthead. <BR> <BR>Something that has
    helped me with drawing an S is &#40;this may be really obvious&#41; starting with
    facing bezier handles being the same length. Does that make sense? This makes
    for a smooth starting curve--then I noodle with the node positions and fine-tune
    the handle lengths. <BR> <BR>This helped me, but someone more experienced may
    have better advice. <BR> <BR>-Addison

  body: '&#62; &#34;S&#34;s are so hard for me to draw! They take me forever and I
    never get them quite right. <BR> <BR>In 1979, Don Knuth wrote an article in the
    Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in which he described the computer
    typesetting system that he was in the process of developing: <BR><blockquote><hr
    size=0><!-quote-!><b>quote:</b><p>The most difficult symbol by far, at least for
    me, was the letter S; in fact I spent three days and nights without sleep, trying
    to make the S look right, before I got it. At one point I even felt it would be
    easier to rewrite all my books without using any S&#39;s! After the first day
    of discouraging trials, I showed the meager results I had to my wife, and she
    said &#34;Why don&#39;t you make it S-shaped?&#34;.<!-/quote-!><hr size=0></blockquote>'

  body: Robin, <BR> <BR>That is a great quote.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have to confess
    that the flourish on the &#34;S&#34; is a result of getting overly frustrated
    with how it was going. I thought I could just make it something other than an
    &#34;S&#34;. Funny. <BR> <BR>S.
