  body: "The line weight and bracketing are different on Avant Garde (namely, Avant
    Garde has it and your sample does not.)\r\n\r\nLooks a lot like Century Gothic
    (or upon closer inspection, the [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/gothic/|URW++
    version]], given the f), modified so that the e is similar to the slant on [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-kabel/|Kabel]]."
