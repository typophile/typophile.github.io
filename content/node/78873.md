body: I know I've seen "No." (as in "number") in some font or other, retro style,
  maybe a wood type font? Can't locate it (it's difficult to google for). Anyone?

  body: "\u2116 sign is used in French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese and means
    \"number\" (it has the same function that # in English). It is an old sign with
    decreasing use nowadays, but still widely found in many serialized itens (receipts,
    periodicals, numbered options). It's also usual in ads to indicate the \"best\"
    product or choice (\"the N\xBA 1\").\r\n\r\nNumeric indication is very common
    in Portuguese (as \"this is the rule n\xB0 4\"), but in this context numero sign
    is usually not used. Instead of it, is simply typed n followed by masculine ordinal,
    a better form to continuous text as \u2116 is usually made with uppercase N and
    may have a slight ornated design. I believe the same occurs in Spanish. Not sure
    about French and Italian.\r\n\r\n\u2116 is available in many fonts and some even
    offer the variation N\xBA/n\xBA to be used in upper/lowercase context. Rarely
    there is also a small caps variant.\r\n\r\nNumero sign is build with a N/n, a
    lowercase o and a dot or horizontal bar. Note the o abbreviates the word (numer<strong>o</strong>)
    so it must not be replaced by zero.\r\n\r\nFor Portuguese and Spanish typographic
    style, proper design of numero sign must use a superscript o underlined or with
    a dot below. If a bar is used, it must be positioned near the o and not at the
    baseline. But if a dot is used, it must be aligned to baseline because it is actually
    abbreviating the word (like n.).\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to build it with N+\xBA+dot
    with negative kerning or N+underlined \xBA.\r\n\r\nSome fonts with well-designed
    \u2116 sign: Candara, Georgia, Linux Libertine (free), Monotype Corsiva, Times
    NR, Verdana, Brioni, Greta, Fedra, Novel Pro, Minion, Myriad, DIN Text, Beau,
    Centro, Arno and all Parachute fonts. An especially good one is the numero sign
    of <em>Girando Pro</em>.\r\n\r\nOther common fonts with \u2116 sign, although
    not using the best design for it: Arial, Calibri, Cambria, Century Schoolbook,
    Corbel, Consolas, Courier, Doulos, DejaVu, Droid, Liberation, Lucida, Palatino
    and Trebuchet.\r\n\r\nThe sign is lacking is Utopia, Freight, Charter, Barmeno,
    Evo and in all fonts from exlijbris and CheapPro."
