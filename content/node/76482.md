    grey area there that you are likely to be measuring opinion rather than fact.
    Revivals are easy since they claim to be copies. \"Inspired by\" gets a bit stickier
    but they still at least knowingly point towards a source. There are also many
    unconscious or subconscious designs which have probably been influenced by prior
    work without intending to. Then there is the \"Great Minds Think Alike\" theory
    which postulates that if one person can logically arrive at a certain solution,
    the odds are a like-minded soul somewhere else has already done so. There certainly
    are plenty of type designers who look at a lot of type and study historic examples
    in their training. There are a sizable number of fonts that you might deem as
    original \"enough\" if you just accept the designer has at least attempted to
    make his own design.  The truth is, nobody is trying to reinvent the alphabet
    yet they must stay close enough to what has been done to be acceptable in the
    marketplace. \r\nAlso, being original is not always the same as being good. The
    first example of say Curlz may be said to be original but perhaps not universally
    thought of as \"good design\"."

    extent to which you can claim to be original, the alphabet remaining the same.\r\nHowever,
    isn't there any type design that is truly path-breaking or not built on past models?
    Can we define that safely as originality?\r\nTo my eyes, script fonts (Mistral
    for instance) seem to have more 'originality', each script being as unique as
    the person writing it. \r\nIs there a first slab-serif, they being very innovative
    in their times? \r\nBeing the first to squarely address the issue of on-screen
    readability isn't Verdana original?"

  body: "Alphabet not built on past models sounds oxymoronic.\r\nBut in other hand,
    alphabet is an evolutionary domain with all these genetic algorythms that check
    all possible directions. Some of the movements create new local maximas* of the
    function, so probably it's possible to foresee a future trend sometime, and go
    there.\r\nBut it's not originality - it's evolutionary adjustment. Originality
    is creating a different species (mutation?).\r\n\r\n*) Let's say it was Bodoni
    on a local top of some function. As there couldn't be anything \"better\" there,
    you have something \"worse\" a bit downhill - Walbaum. When to add a bit of different
    DNA, another hill grows in neighbourhood - with Akzidenz Grotesk climbing up,
    Helvetica on the top, and Arial in the next valley (not to be continued, incest
    danger).\r\n\r\nFor me, originality is asking delicate questions of things we
    have got used to. It is looking for a hole in the whole, undermining doubtfull
    aspects that seem sure in glory of tradition. Probably slab-serif was a kind of
    such act.\r\nScript fonts pretend to be highly original, but damn, what's less
    original than a font based on someone's handwritting? Probably FF Pitu has some
    level of originality on this field..."

    definition, it is a copy of handwriting.  Like everything, some are good and some
    are bad. There are so many handwriting fonts made today that they just seem to
    melt into a stew.\r\n\r\nI also don't think the idea of putting slab serifs on
    a type is very original.  What can be original is to do it very well right off
    the bat and have it work for its audience.\r\nPersonally, I don't see much value
    in chasing that dog around the tree.  People end up recategorizing and arguing
    over minutia and no purpose is served.  It would make much more sense for you
    to design an original font yourself.  After a few hundred hours of work, you will
    have discovered how difficult it is to reinvent the wheel in such a way that it
    still rolls perfectly the same as the others but you somehow know it is different
    than the rest."

    monowidth\r\n\r\nBodoni Egyptian: Bodoni, slabbified, without the high contrast.
    \r\nI wouldn't say that applying an anachronistic genre is a completely original
    idea. Legacy, for instance, is \"Jenson Sans\", and Chapparal is a \"slabbed-up
    Antiqua\".\r\nNonetheless, I do feel that Bodoni Egyptian is a reasonably original
    idea, not least because I didn't get the idea from those two faces, but by observing
    that the serifs of digital Berthold Bodoni (very much a text face) looked like
    slab serifs at display size.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    just so tired about this one, or that one, pointing out how similar a font is
    to this or that.\r\n\r\nAs long as the information was not reversed engineered,
    or stolen, what's the big deal that a new font shares some characteristics with
    another font (or fonts). We have all been influenced but the designs of others.
    We have all taken, bits and pieces of other peoples ideas (or designs) and incorporated
    or blended, melded, them into our own work, in one form or another.\r\n\r\nThere
    is no denying that!\r\n\r\nIf you want, I would be happy to list hundreds, thousands
    of fonts (in the last 20 years) and show where the creative influence came from.
    But that would be a big project in itself, and I do not have the time for such
    things.\r\n\r\nBut, who cares anyway. Again I repeat... as long as something is

    things.\r\n\r\nWe all realize that digitization and technology has made it easier
    to copy information in many different forms.\r\n\r\nIn the past, someone could
    scan or make a copy of your letter forms, with tracing paper overlays, and adjust
    the shapes with pencil in hand to alter the shapes and create new letter forms
    or derivatives of your work. Someone else with more skill could simply look at
    what you have done, and quickly sketch new ideas on paper or go direct to digital
    form and render a design similar to yours, with enough variations to render the
    work an original.\r\n\r\nToday, someone can open your font outlines in FontLab
    and peek at your kerning data, or analyze your outlines, or take bits and pieces
    of your digital data, and construct a relatively new font design.\r\n\r\nSomeone
    in the near future, with \"atom manipulating\" technology will be able to reproduce
    the \"Mona Lisa\" painting, molecule by molecule, undistinguishable from the original.
    Or, he/she may add a mustache and convert the charismatic smile to a frown and
    call it \"Mona Lisa ala Pop Art\".\r\n\r\nCan any of us really stop any of this
    technology from coming to pass, or stop anyone from using this technology as I've
    described.\r\n\r\nI think not. Society will have to adopt to all these technological
    changes. But, human beings will continue to do what they do best. Create and improve
    on the things of the past. Every one of us tinkers, experiments and regurgitates
    their experiences in their own unique way. Sometimes, if we tinker well, we make
    an improvement.\r\n\r\nFord engineers, peek under the hood of foreign car manufactures
    and adopt or improve on the technology to make a better or more competitive American
    automobile. I could give you hundreds of other such examples.\r\n\r\nNone of this
    stops the creative process or hinders originality in any way or form. In fact,
    we are going through an originality explosion and revolution exponentially. New
    ideas and products are coming to be, faster and faster then ever before.\r\n\r\nThe
    same is true of type design and the explosion of new font designs and ideas that
    we have witnessed in the last 20 years.\r\n\r\nThis is all great stuff! Embrace
    it.\r\n\r\nTechnology is just a tool to enable us all to experiment and create
    new products. And better font products. Faster than ever before.\r\n\r\n\"Toto,
    I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. We must be over the rainbow!\" :)\r\n"
