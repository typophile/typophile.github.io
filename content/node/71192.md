body: "Gah, I've never done this before and debated promoting the typeface here at
  all, but since you all give me inspiration and happiness with your new releases,
  it would be selfish of me not to share with you all. So sheepishly, here it is.\r\n\r\nThe
  other day I release Ne10, a new stencil typeface I designed, through YWFT. This
  stencil font takes its inspiration from a neon sign at my local pizzeria without
  being blatant in its reference. I found myself staring at the sign too often, so
  I decided to try to work it out digitally. While sketching it up I realized that
  this could work rather nicely as a stencil font, instead of a faux 3D neon looking
  thing. So although the inspiration is neon, the result is more modern looking. Hopefully
  some of you will like it. \r\n\r\nI don't understand the linking system here, so
  here is the link \u2014 http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0668\r\n\r\nThe
  inspiration: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/cerveza_4341.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe result:

  body: "N,\r\n\r\nI tried to understand it, but it doesn't conform to any of the
    standards that I know. *sheepishly* And I was being a little lazy. \r\nI did edit
    the image to fix the scroll bar issue, thank you.\r\n\r\nI think the problem with
    rendering it realistically is that you get stumped by either the physical 3D quality
    of the tubes, or you get it when you realize part of what makes it look correct
    is that it emits light. Well, probably it's both of those things. Which is pretty
    difficult to realize fully given the limitations of what a typeface is (or at
    least what a typeface is right now, maybe in a future iteration)."

  body: "By \"accurate\" I mean that the font letters correspond to functional neon
    lettering, i.e. without strict geometricality and impossible overlaps and sharp
    corners, and with appropriate lengths of \"tube\" (not too stencilly).\r\n\r\nIt
    wouldn't necessarily make for a good typeface, I'm just observing that there is
    nothing that \"real\" in the way of fonts."
