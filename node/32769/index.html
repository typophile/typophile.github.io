Haven't we already got that right here on typophile?
i suggest someone starts to write reviews on typophile! the reviews could be sorted under their own folder in the forum. I suggest two solutions:
1) the reviews are "official" typophile reviews. The reviewers are nominated (is that an english word?) by the editors (whoever they are). Only these reviewers are allowed to start review threads, but everyone is welcome to comment/discuss. This solution would ignite much debate over who is allowed to review, whether the editors are biased, and so on. That is, of course, a good thing. One problem is whether the odd "what do you think about my new font" is considered a review when people start answering. then , essentially everyone gets to write reviews.
2) Everyone gets to review, just make a new category under the forums folder. Pro: more democracy. Con: Everyone gets to write reviews, which would lead to a lot af debate about the quality of the reviews, the objectivity of the writers and so on.
i vote for number 1.

<div class=commentbody>alex, ideally, this type of info could be housed in the wiki area. there are already several threads for individual [[typefaces]], these could be expanded by anyone who cares to include reviews of these faces. in fact, i believe that the article on [[Mrs Eaves]] has some discussion about the pros and cons of that particular typeface. This could be improved upon, of course, perhaps wiki contributors could start adding a section entitled "Review" to articles on typefaces.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Alex's first idea sounds like a great idea.
I will have to look at Paul Shaw's column in <strong>Print</strong> more closely because my impression of it so far is that he kind of introduces new typefaces that are interesing but not that he is really reviewing them.
Idealy what I would love to find would be something like <a href=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/>Pitchfork</a> for type.
Thank you everyone for your answers. I'm going to have a lot of fun checking them all out.

well i guess it all depends on what you mean by "review." i was thinking of some kind of formalistic analysis of typefaces in question, but i guess that doesn't always make for the best reading. i like when there are reviews on typographer.org or typographica, but i realize stephen and yves are too busy to post such things on a regular basis.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>i like when there are reviews on typographer.org or typographica
I agree with you Paul about how interesting these are. And if Typophile could foster them, and maybe collect references to outside reviews--typographica, John Berry, typographer.org, etc.--it would be great.
I think you are onto something in thinking that a wiki-like structure would be good. That is, you have the name of the typeface as the title, and then people can add comments. But for this kind of thing, because it is a review, it might be best to have them added as signed entries, rather than combined into one.
It is really a lot of work to do a typeface review responsibly, as Yves did with his Fleishmann revival extravaganza. This is because it involves testing the typeface in its intended context. But it would be great encourage this kind of effort, and to build a repository of comments pro and con on a face, saying how people like to use it, where they find it problematic, and so on. This would be enlightening to both graphic designers and types designers, I think.
Ah--just thought of a model: the reviews at Amazon.com. Here others can also rate how useful they find the review, which is nice also. </div>

<div class=commentbody>>> The interactive, public resource for fonts, news and reviews
> Haven’t we already got that right here on typophile?
No, I would not say so. I'd say that this is a place where people usually discuss type in general. This includes currently just about every aspect but reviews. I don't think that Typophile holds discussions constantly about type and humor, technical specs, software and hardware, type fashion, teaching, new releases and just about everything under the sun EXCEPT reviews. I suspect there is a reason.
"Official" reviews here might create a tension that would impede the Type Collaboration motto that fuels this hangout. This is somewhat of an Elysium for people in the industry, alongside other roles.
Nevertheless, I enjoy type reviews a great bit when I find them. As a designer of fonts, I like to learn what people appreciate or despise in others' work. As a type fanboy, I like to read the history, trivia and bios and enjoy contemplating a talented critic's opinions. As a shopper, I would part with my money much more happily (read: more often) if I felt more informed beforehand. So there should be something offering this service.
Duncan says he is looking for something like Pitchfork for type. I glanced at the home page and thought, "yeah. That." I proposed the Typosium project because the solution he wants doesn't seem to exist yet. Could something else become that? Probably, but that doesnt mean it is now. I imagined content that is a type-oriented crossing of Consumer Reports and Spin magazines, and even refer to Typosium as a 'zine at times.
<a href=http://typophile.com/node/30882>This thread</a> gives some background on the idea, and why it isn't doing what Typophile could probably do better. The <a href="http://typosium.org/deptofplanning/index.php?topic=2.0">Manifesto</a> explains things best, as that actually got such luxuries as a drafts and revisions. Right now I am preparing for a major product release, and there are several questions on the table for anyone interested in developing Typosium more. My attention will return to it shortly.</div>
