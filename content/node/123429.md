body: "Can any French typesetters (or of course English typesetters with extensive
  experience of French typesetting) give me the rules for which spaces should appear
  before and after the different punctuation marks?\r\n\r\nI found this excerpt courtesy
  of Microsoft:\r\n<blockquote> Note: When traditionally typesetting the French language
  a word space is inserted before or after several punctuation characters. These characters
  are colon, semi colon, question, exclamation, right guillemets, and left guillemets.
  Commonly the preferred word space used is a thin space of 1/8 the em. Some French
  typographers prefer to use a larger space character of 1/4 the em with the colon
  and some other punctuation characters. OpenType supports character substitution
  and language dependant variants.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nbut wanted to know if indeed
  it's a regular space (and also if it\u2019s fixed space or variable) or whether
  different width spaces are used for different punctuation. I seem to recall reading
  a French site with the help of google translate which seem to indicate that different
  widths are used depending on the punctuation.\r\n\r\nI'm about to typeset an important
  book in French (and next month the book will be in German so I will be back again
  asking questions :-) ), but for now I want to make sure I\u2019m doing the French
  correctly."
