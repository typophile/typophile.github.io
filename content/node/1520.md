  body: Very close &#40;but off a bit on at least a couple of characters&#41; is <a
    href="http://www.leuthard.ch/fonts/M.htm" target="_blank"> Miele</a>. <BR> <BR>The
    fact that this font contains no copyright info makes me suspicious, but it&#39;s
    been around as a freeware font for many years and I&#39;ve not seen a typeface
    yet that Miele is a knockoff of. <BR> <BR>One page I visited referred to Miele
    as a typeface seen &#34;on those coffee places in Vienna&#34;. This means nothing
    to me &#40;in the USA&#41;, but perhaps is a clue? <BR><br>

  body: Thanks for the replies. <BR> <BR>I contacted the designer of the graphic and
    she told me it&#39;s a font called Jellybean. Searches for a Jellybean font turned
    up a host of other fonts, but not the one above. The designer said she didn&#39;t
    remember where she got it or who made it, but that it&#39;s &#34;an old one.&#34;

    such as Trademarker from FontFont...? <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/"

    that. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your help.

    Xara &#40;the graphics programs company&#41;. The <BR>$2 fonts are supposedly
    old Fontbank fonts that they <BR>claim to be licensed to sell. <BR> <BR>It was
    Mike Yanega &#40;who <i>deserves</i> to be <BR>called good ... no make that <i>really</i>
    good&#41; who pointed <BR>out the Fontbank connection. <BR><br>

  body: For one more bit of trivia about &#39;Jellybean&#39; from the FontBank collection.
    My notes say the true typeface this is based on is called &#39;Jumbo&#39; designed
    by Gustav Jaeger for Berthold in 1978.

    the thrill of the hunt for the ID.  <BR>I learn. Almost every single day. <BR>
    <BR>No sign of Jaeger&#39;s original Jumbo anywhere online,  <BR>unfortunately.
