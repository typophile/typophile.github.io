<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
One difficulty in persuasion is overcoming the confirmation bias, where people selectively seek evidence that is consistent with their prior beliefs and expectations. This biased search for information allows people to analyze new information in an efficient, but shallow way. The present research discusses how experienced difficultly in processing (disfluency) can reduce the confirmation bias by promoting careful, analytic processing. In two studies, participants with prior attitudes on an issue became less extreme after reading an argument on the issues in a disfluent format. The change occurred for both naturally occurring attitudes (i.e. political ideology) and experimentally assigned attitudes (i.e. positivity toward a court defendant). Importantly, disfluency did not reduce confirmation biases when participants were under cognitive load, suggesting that cognitive resources are necessary to overcome these biases. Overall, these results suggest that changing the style of an argument&rsquo;s presentation can lead to attitude change by promoting more comprehensive consideration of opposing views.</p>

I think that to say &ldquo;In other words, novelty can be persuasive&rdquo; is not accurate to the point of the article. It is not that novelty is persuasive, but that familiarity allows this confirmation bias, and therefore novelty allows more play to the rational intelligence. It is not the novelty itself is being persuasive, but allowing a good argument a better chance of sinking in.</p>
<p>Novelty in advertising has a related effect, catching attention, and therefor creating a better chance for the punter to read the message.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, you might have provided a link to the version available at no cost on line: 
<a href="http://www.uofisocialcognitionlab.x10.mx/Papers/Hernandez_Preston_2012.pdf">http://www.uofisocialcognitionlab.x10.mx/Papers/Hernandez_Preston_2012.pdf</a>
The paper references or extends work reported in the 
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/94174">http://typophile.com/node/94174</a> thread I noted above.</p>
<p>The idea of disfluency leading to positive effects is not new. It seems to be implicit in the early 20th-century notion of ostranenie (literally: <em>making strange</em>) or defamiliarization associated with the Russian literary critic Viktor Borisovich Shklovsky. See: 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamiliarization">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamiliarization</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Shklovsky">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Shklovsky</a></p>
<p>I would have some questions about the use of ‘[dis]fluent’ in these studies. For example, is it meant in roughly the same sense as by the authors of the paper featured in this thread:

<p>That&rsquo;s the argument made by the researchers. But the summary provided supports Nick&rsquo;s take just as well as theirs. Theirs has an interesting theoretical basis.</p>
<p>Now, one could design an experiment specifically to distinguish the two hypotheses. For example, what if the question at hand is one for which the subjects have no preconception whatsoever?</p>
<p>I suspect Nick is right, in part based on the recent study involving remembering information about imaginary alien species.</p>

<p>Sorry, but that notion is preposterous. Perception—in the natural order of reception, perception, conception—occurs at the pre-rational level; in other words, information from the five senses is processed <em>before</em> the Sixth Sense—the Sense of Self—enters into the picture.</p>
