  my company logo. He has come up with the following, and I was interested in other
  opinions.  For what it is worth, my web-designer who does not know the graphic designer,
  hates the new logo, my company name, and my old logo!\r\nYou may also need to know
  that we design houses, shop & restaurant interiors, small buildings, etc.  Architectural
  design. See www.katipodesign.co.nz (the old website)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. Mat\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/files/Katipo_Logo_sm.jpg"

    it's the only poisonous native animal or insect. \r\n\r\nHowever, I agree with
    everyone else. Ditch the spider and try to communicate your company's values and
    strengths instead. "

  body: "Thank you all for your comments.\r\n\r\nThe spider is my idea, not the graphics
    designer.  I have had the spider logo since 2004, and I am still OK with it.  Partly
    my argumentative nature I guess, because everyone says \"most people are scared
    of spiders, so don't use it\", just makes me want to use it more LOL.  \r\nMay
    I point out that Alfa Romeo has a snake, Lacoste has a croc. Scorpion sports moto-x
    gear, Balmain tigers, etc etc, so the scared of spiders argument doesn't convince
    me.    \r\nThere is a definite \"viral\" advantage to the spider - the ladies
    who work at the various Council Offices we deal with all remember the spider,
    so when I need help they often know me by name, likewise with many of the sales
    reps, Engineers etc, all of whom we require to complete a job.\r\n\r\nSo seriously,
    how offputting to the typical civilian is a spider name/logo? "

  body: I think the issue is less with the fear of spiders per se and more with the
    feeling of dislike or yuckiness/disgust they evoke. Something that is not an issue
    with either a snake or a crocodile.

  body: "People are not disgusted by spiders - they are afraid of them, but they respect
    them too. They admire their fastidious, diligent nature, not to mention their
    beautiful but incredibly strong webs. Tarantulas might be visually unappealing,
    but something like a Black Widow is incredibly elegant. I myself have no problem
    squashing a cockroach, but I will do my darndest to avoid killing a spider.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER:\r\n1)
    It should definitely be a representational, not a realistic rendering.\r\nAnd
    maybe something faceted, like this: http://typophile.com/node/64559\r\n2) No gradients,
    please. One or two solid colors.\r\n3) That font has to go.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I am genuinely appreciative of all the comments, so my counter-arguments
    are for enlightenment, not enflamement :) (sic).\r\n\r\nWell people don't find
    Spiderman yucky....girls love him I believe, at least black Spiderman in 3.\r\n\r\nOne
    of my local competitors has the name \"Fat Hippo Design Group\", www.fathippo.org/
    which seems to me no better than \"Katipo Design\", in fact sillier. At least
    occasionally I have a client who is interested in Spiders (actually only one client
    ever).\r\n\r\nThere is another large firm in NZ called IGNITE Architecture, www.ignitearchitects.com/
    and I bet every person they canvassed about their name said \"sounds like your
    buildings burn down\". \r\n\r\nNZ's biggest architecture firm has the name JASMAX
    www.jasmax.com/ (innovative website BTW) which as a name has nothing to do with
    architecture, or the values of the company.\r\n\r\nSounds like I am trying to
    defend my choice of spider as brand identity without any consideration of my clients......\r\n\r\nWhat
    comments have you all?\r\n"

    negative, and there is an argument for continuity.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I think Hrant
    sums it up perfectly"

    should go in. \r\n\r\n\"I have had the spider logo since 2004, and I am still
    OK with it. Partly my argumentative nature\"\r\n\r\nPoisonous spiders and argumentative
    nature seem to be the last two things you'd want to communicate about your business.
    \r\n\r\nNow, that said, Katipo is a great word. Looking at your work, you appear
    to design sleek modern houses. I think the logo should reflect that aesthetic.\r\n\r\nFocus
    on simplicity, stability, geometry. If the name of the company is 'katipo' there's
    no real reason to have a literal spider be a part of the logo. That's overkill.
    \r\n\r\nNow, don't take this the wrong way, but, in general I've found architects
    to be wannabe graphic designers and graphic designers to be wannabe architects.
    While there is definite overlap, I don't think the skillsets are interchangeable.
    I'd love to design my own house some day but know that an architect would do a
    much better job than I would. "

  body: "Reading up on the spider, I'd consider going a bit more abstract if you really
    want to have a image based logo:\r\n\r\n - The common name, katipo, is a M\u0101ori
    name \r\n - is only found near the seashore living among sand dunes\r\n - Spiders
    inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass
    tufts\r\n - Spin an irregular tangled web \r\n\r\nHowever, I'd also consider explorer
    type only solutions. For an architect, your brand image is really more about your
    portfolio than the logo itself. "

  body: "This looks to me like a pest control logo. I think you can use a spider,
    but play it down a little, use something abstract. Make the spider more approachable.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/images-1_5440.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/images-2_4580.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/images-3_4649.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/images_4653.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spider-logo-678DA347E0-seeklogo_6261.com.gif]\r\n\r\nThese
    are probably all wrong for what you are going for, but the tone is more approachable.
    And think of the Spiderman logo, it is an abstraction. That is where I would go.\r\n\r\n<a
