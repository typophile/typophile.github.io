    FontBook Dingbats section and the closest I could find was <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=GF.100270.0.3\">Oak
    Simblz</a>, that has a couple of very stylized mandala designs that you might
    stretch to call a dandelion seed or flower head.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    why i was asking in here ;)\r\n\r\nthank you for your suggest mike - i think i
    ll be drawing by myself. :(\r\nstill seems to be more efficient than searching
    for ages or modifying something that just can not be tuned to perfect.\r\n\r\n"
