  body: Almost all TrueType or OpenType text fonts are Unicode encoded &#40;ie contain
    a Unicode character map&#41;, so I suppose you&#39;re really asking for a font
    that covers all or most of the Unicode standard &#40;currently version 4.0&#41;.
    Unfortunately TrueType and OpenType fonts have a limit of 64K glyphs and as Unicode
    contains many more than this you&#39;re out of luck.   <BR> <BR>Are there specific
    languages you&#39;re looking to support? Is there any reason why you need all
    of these languages supported in a single font? <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si
