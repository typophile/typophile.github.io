  body: Its part of a massive crackdown by the US government on .ca domain names registered
    to a sleeper cell of typographic insurgents located in the US and Sweden. Actually
    I think Stephen mentioned somewhere that the issue was with the .ca domain.

  body: the .ca name expired and canada needs an ID to prove the owner is canadian
    &#40;or something like that&#41;. Last I heard, they&#39;re faxing the stuff in.

  body: CIRA, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority, took acceptation to the
    declared ownership of the typographi.ca domain, which they have the right to do
    according to their charter and rules. The domain wasn&#39;t exprired, per se,
    but suspended - and the name server entries deleted from the domain record. Without
    those entries, your browser can&#39;t locate the server. Regardless of the rational
    behind the situation, the way that CIRA deals with these issues is extremely heavy-handed.
