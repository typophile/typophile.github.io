  a blog article about the typographic and composition improvements I made to my resume.
  \   [[http://zgrossbart.blogspot.com/2008/10/resume-tale-of-desire-intrigue-and.html|Resume:
  A Tale of Desire, Intrigue, and Formatting]] is an outline of the process I used
  to improve my resume with a little help from The Elements of Typographic Style and
  FF Scala.  I hope this will help other engineers with very little understanding
  of typography make their resumes better.\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful to get some
  feedback from more experienced designers.  Did the resumes actually get better?
  \ Is the final resume any good?  Is the advice I give good advice?  What do you
  think of the overall concept?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\n[[http://zgrossbart.blogspot.com/2008/10/resume-tale-of-desire-intrigue-and.html]]\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nZack\r\n"

    thing I would suggest is that the line length on your blog is far too long. :^)"

    appalling resumes use highlighter pen to mark up the points to pay attention to.\r\n\r\nSeeing
    you're a Python scripter, do you also do PHP? We're looking for someone to revamp
    some things under Typophile's Drupal (PHP/MySQL) hood."

  body: "Hello Joe,\r\n\r\nI guess being offered a job is the ultimate positive review
    of a resume.  Thank you very much.  Unfortunately I already have a full-time job
    and I'm writing a book on the side.  You should consider posting your job opportunity
    to [[http://jobs.sourceforge.net/]].  They have a lot of PHP programmers looking
    at their job listings.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nZack\r\n"

  body: "I guess my first comment was kind of knee-jerk. I hope I can redeem myself.\r\n\r\nOverall
    it is very good. Organized. Clear. The only three things I might re-consider are
    point-size (Scala always looks so tight to me), leading (if point-size doesn't
    give enough air), and full-justification.\r\n\r\nI guess of those three the justification
    is the thing I'd do if nothing else. One reason is to avoid spots in the text
    or rivers. Under \"project administrator\", the last sentence which begins GOTD,
    it looks as if you have a double space when it is really a result of the justification.
    You'd not justified the first two paragraphs, and I don't think I'd justify the
    rest. \r\n\r\nI'd also take the last line, the references line, and align it with
    the rest of the paragraphs on the left. You've not centered anything else so there
    is little reason to start.\r\n\r\nSorry I see one more thing. This is a fault
    of the typeface and not you. The bold appears smaller than the roman. I don't
    recall of this is a fault of the hinting or if it appears in the printing as well.
    But I might scale the bold type up .5 pt or so.\r\n\r\nOk this is the last. You
    \ might consider sizing the all caps (small caps?) lines down a bit and letter
    spacing them a bit more. "

  body: ">begins GOTD, it looks as if you have a double space when it is really a
    result of the justification\r\n\r\nThere actually is a double space.\r\n\r\nThe
    title (your name) is rather overpowering, as you acknowledge in your blog it is
    the vital part of the cv, however I would look at reducing it to the measure of
    the main text block, possibly aligning the baseline with the baseline of the url,
    preserving the lefthand column for navigation.\r\n\r\nThe list of Technical Skills
    needs some way of differentiating between lines, although most employers would
    be used to picking out the initials (because they would be looking for them) it
    doesn\u2019t hurt to assist them. You could add a half line space after each topic;
    a tab after each colon; or bold the topic title \u2013 I wouldn't use all of these
    options.\r\n\r\nThe heading Experience is aligned with the first line of the description,
    you could try positioning it above the text block so that the job title aligns
    with the first line of the description.\r\n\r\nThe last line is left awkwardly
    floating, you could align it to the left under the headings or the text block.\r\n\r\nSome
    of these suggestions will interfere with your vertical space but I think it will
    just work. Regarding Tiffany\u2019s suggestion about the measure, the last lines
    of each experience paragraph has got enough space to reduce the measure without
    adding another line to the depth. By reducing the measure and shifting it to the
    right by the amount of reduction, you might be able to get happier line breaks
    in the job titles, although you might have to settle for abbreviations for months.\r\n\r\nTim"
