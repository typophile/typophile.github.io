  No 2 is a sans family designed for display settings. Narrow letters, tight spacing,
  and a low x-height make Lorimer \u2116 2 better suited to display settings than
  fonts adjusted to work in text settings. Packaging, identities, and headlines are
  ideal applications for Lorimer No 2.\r\n\r\nDesigner James Puckett developed Lorimer
  No. 2 as the result of researching nineteenth century memorial inscriptions. A condensed
  sans serif inscription on a Manhattan burial vault prompted research and experimentation.
  Research turned up similar letters in American wood type, memorials in an Indian
  cathedral, and enameled tiles in the New York City subway. Puckett developed his
  experiments into a type family with two widths, five weights, and matching italics.\r\n\r\n<a
