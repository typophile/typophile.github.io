body: "I'm making a big multilingual sans serif and by default, the \"a\" and the
  \"g\" are double storey. I do include the single story versions available by \"salt\"
  because this feature works virtually everywhere, where there is Opentype). \r\n\r\nHowever,
  I've heard that the Germans mostly use the single story <em>g</em>. I've searched
  pictures of various street signs in Germany and Austria and I haven't found any
  double story g's. \r\n\r\nWould it be ok to include 'locl' feature for German language
  to substitute only the g (while leaving the \"a\" double story)? I do understand
  that the single story g has its roots in Fraktur. And is it a German-only preference
  or the neighbour languages like Dutch, Danish, Swedish, etc. look more natural with
  a single storey g?\r\n\r\nIn the attachment, there's an example with single and
  double storey g's. To my eyes, the combination of single story g and double story
  a looks more \"natural\" in a German text. Don't look at the kerning, I didn't start
  polishing it yet."

    (one-storey).\r\nTwo German types from the 1920s: Kabel (two-storey) and Futura
    (one-storey).\r\nI would say it\u2019s up to the type designer.\r\n\r\nWith regards
    to the Germanization of Gill Sans, that would appear to be another special case.
    Perhaps this pandered to the stereotype of European modernism. Or perhaps, soon
    after WWII (which is when I believe it was manufactured, not before), there was
    a feeling that Gill Sans was too \uFB01rmly associated with England, and this
    would have negative connotations in Germany. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GillGerman_4324.jpg]\r\n\r\nFrom

    that you\u2019re putting a single-story g as an alternate, but I\u2019d see no
    reason to make it a locl.\r\n\r\nSamples like that Gill, I would see that rather
    in a historical than a geographic context (\u201Cpandered to the stereotype of
    European modernism\u201D sounds right; weren\u2019t there lots of faces that suddenly
    came up with Futura-esque alternates\u2026).\r\nDurchschu\xDF means leading, FWIW."
