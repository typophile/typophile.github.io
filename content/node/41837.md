body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nWe've recently been commissioned to produce a brochure
  for a new client, although their previous marketing department were reluctant to
  provide artwork for their brand. After continual trial & error, I'm requesting whether
  one of you might be able to identify the typeface utilised in their brand.\r\n\r\nIf
  the attachment doesn't work (it rarely does for some reason) I've hosted it <a href=\"http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/4674/jebbpf8.jpg\">here</a>\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your consideration,\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n\r\n"
