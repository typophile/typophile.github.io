  unfortunately I cannot remember the name of the thread's originator (although I
  know they were from Ankara), the only other post was from Prakash Nair, I got the
  \"page not found\" page and now I cannot find the thread.\r\nAnyway, my apologies
  if I inadvertently killed off your thread, it really wasn't that bad.\r\nTim"
