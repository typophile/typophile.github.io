  body: "Hello all.\r\n\r\nI am the creator of the logo in question, simple as it
    may be.  The font I used is called Timpani; bold for IntelliCom, bold-italic for
    Analytics.  Taking a quick look at ITC Tiffany, I'd say they are the same font.\r\n\r\nMy
    father-in-law works for IntelliCom, which is how I got to do to logo, and just
    pointed this thread out to me.  I guess he was Googling at work again. q-:"

    I googled the \"Timpani\" font and sadly it appears to be a straight-forward knock
    off of ITC Tiffany that's free."

    body: "Heh.  That seems to be the case quite often, unfortunately.  I believe
      my copy came from one of those \"more fonts than any human could possibly use
      in their lifetime\" disks that I stole from my mom a while back.  Every time
      I build a new machine I backup my fonts folder and copy it over to the new one,
      so I can't for the life of me remember where some of them come from.\r\n\r\nWhat
      made finding people playing \"name that font\" with the IntelliCom logo was
      particularly funny for me because of all the times my online friends and I have
      done the same thing with logos and numbers when trying to create/re-create paint
      schemes for race cars to go into various racing games.\r\n\r\nNifty forum ya'll
      got here.  Think I may just stick around. "
