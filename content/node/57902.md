body: "I'm working on a new volume in a book series typeset in TimesBasis. At least,
  that's what Acrobat comes up with (TimesBasis and TimesBasisIt, Type 1). Unfortunately,
  Google cannot find any reference to this font. I've checked a number of Times cuts
  (Monotype, Linotype and the standard Windows Times New Roman), and I get confused.
  The closest match is the Windows TNR and the Linotype cut. But still some differences
  remain.\r\n\r\nCan anybody here point me in the right direction?"
