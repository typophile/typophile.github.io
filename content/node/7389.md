  body: <i>Has it been around long?</i> <BR>MIke Abbink at Wolff Olins did the finishing
    work on the typeface, earlier this summer. Not a bad attempt for a corporate font,
    albeit in line with Wolff Olins

  body: Erik, <BR> <BR>It&#39;s always great to see a real pro chiming in here from
    time to time! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a sucker for the rounded terminals, although I
    wonder if it&#39;s almost too cute at times. We&#39;ll have to see what the eventual
    shelf life of it is.  <BR> <BR>Great work, as usual, on the Bosch typface...

  body: 'I don&#39;t care for rounded terminals at all. And I find the GE-font rather
    too &#34;artsy&#34; and fashionable. Reading longer texts in smaller sizes will
    make you feel that you need to visit an optician. <BR>On the other hand, I think
    Mr Spiekerman&#39;s new creation is an an excellent take on the classic Grotesk.
    I&#39;d use it in a whif instead of the poor digitizations of Franklin and Akzidenz
    that are commonly available. <BR>BTW: the imagination3 site is wonderful!'
