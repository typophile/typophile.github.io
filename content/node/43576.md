  it is even worth it to continue on this project.  I'm not too experienced with typography.
  \ This is somewhat the first time I have even attempted something like this.\r\n\r\nAnother
  thing, I used two fonts for this, and I don't even remember the second one.  The
  first is Times.  If you can identify the other, that would be amazing![img:sites/default/files/old-images/MikleBanks_3883.jpg]"

  body: As a concept it could work but there are some problems with the letterforms
    in shape spacing & so on. If you keep going I would reconsider making the top
    of the i under the dot take the same shape as the l and/or I would let the letter
    be less tall. The k needs to be redrawn with the weight distributed more like
    Times. Part of the trouble is that you have an italic weight distribution for
    your loop but the letter is upright. Some tweaks you made are distracting like
    the way the bowl joins the upright on the a. The logo has to be unified. This
    pulls in too many directions. I can't tell you if you should keep going. You could
    explain the context more fully...

  body: Wow, the x-height on this is EXTREME. If the shapes were more classic, this
    might be a good screen font.

  body: "I wanted to see if this could work as a full typeface.  There are so many
    things I cannot see that are wrong here.  I love these suggestions.  I seriously
    do not think I could make this work as a full typeface with the little knowledge
    I have about this stuff.\r\n\r\nI may just have to use it as a logo with the suggestions
    that were given.  Let me revise this.  If you want I can upload the ai file.  I
    am trying to figure out some of Ebens suggestions.\r\n\r\nThis is more overwhelming
    than I thought hah!\r\n\r\nThank you though!"

  body: With the tall x-height and swashy k it kinda reminds me of lettering done
    for romance novels. The caps seem a bit out of sync but it does have a hand drawn
    type sort of flavor.

  body: I do not really know whether it is good or not. I would just say, I do not
    really like it because the proportion is not "balanced" as if very thin elves.
    They are a little too narrow. I do not mind the huge x-height, but it does not
    help with the legibility. I do not know. They just feel weird to me. My suggestion
    is, pick an existing typeface that is similar to your goal, and then basing on
    that typeface you innovate a new one. By doing that, getting the "correct" proportion
    should be no problem.
