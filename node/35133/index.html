<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm a typophile. Yes, a true addict. I will freely (and guiltily) admit to having in my possession several hundreds of free and commercial, legally and illegally-acquired fonts that I will probably never, ever use -- from large foundaries and small. Fonts in TrueType, PostScript Type 1, and OpenType formats.
But there are some that I'm absolutely in love with. I use the Scala Sans font family in my resume. This family is so much easier to read than TrueType Arial and its forced variations. I know this one is commercial, and I will buy them all as soon as it's financially feasible.
I also use some of the fonts in documents I create for the D&D game.  I have not distributed any of my work (aside from my resume), but even privately I like to make the documents look as much as if they had been downloaded from the Wizards of the Coast website as I can. These fonts are no secret to those interested in the typography and design of the D&D product line.

Eventually, I would like to release some of my work on the Internet. And this would actually require specific fonts, which are variations of the commercial fonts I have already used. These variations are not available, freely (as in legally free) or commercially, anywhere. For instance, the font Celestia Antiqua Medium, used in countless PDFs on the Wizards of the Coast website and in their books, is not available for sale. Dactyl, also, is conspicuously missing. And while Celestia Antiqua Regular and Ptera suit for private use, they aren't the same.
My question, then, is "What would be the best methods to legitimately acquire those fonts I can't get through normal channels?" Remember, I want to own and be able to use these fonts in my work, and even though they will likely never be used for profit of any sort, I'd like to keep that option open. Still, I want the quality of the actual fonts (not ripped from PDF or PS files - I have <em>some</em> dignity, as well as a decent eye for aesthetics).
Edit for spelling at 2:46 Central time.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe try contacting the designer:

<div class=commentbody>I think the only legitimate way to access un-released proprietary fonts for personal use might be through journalism. Write about fonts, get good at it, get published and only then will people possibly trust you with their unreleased work. Based on this a request to use these fonts for D&D work may be considered strange - but hell, there are stranger people in the font world.
Cheers, Si</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yep. My long-running unscientific test is to say to which ever font person I'm talking to "You know (insert the name of the person I'm talking to), you and me are the only sane people in this business" and from the look on their face you can tell exactly where on the chart they place themselves. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Sii has never performed that (un)scientific test on me, but if he did, it would make for quite the ludicrous moment.
To the topic, I think asking in person and seeming reasonable is likely to work well. Especially, I think if you let the designer know that you appreciate and value their work and are not just looking for something for nothing, it's easy to imagine them being flexible.
