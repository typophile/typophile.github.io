  The \"O\" and \"R\" throw me off a bit; maybe I'm just not seeing it right. \r\n\r\nAny

  body: Looks like a good fit but feels different. Maybe it's me. I have DIN Pro and
    I tried DIN bold and medium, but something about the width seems a tad off. Going
    to look closer, thanks!

  body: I tried this with two flavours of DIN Medium weight, and it's a near perfect
    match. Only the /W/ appears slightly slimmer.

  body: Thanks for the replies, it's highly appreciated. I also tried the DIN Medium
    and it's hitting very close and I also see the /W/ is a tad slimmer. I can live
    with that one for now. Thanks again!
