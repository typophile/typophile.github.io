body: "Dear all,\r\n\r\nI would like to identify a typewriter font.\r\n\r\nMy research
  on Identifont allowed me to come close the solution, but few details prevented me
  from identifying the font.\r\n\r\nThe closest font is the \"FF Trixie\", but \"8\"
  and \"D\" do not correspond.\r\n\r\nI used the \"Fonts by similarity\" option (www.identifont.com)
  and went on the website of the \"FF Trixie\" publisher (http://www.fontfont.com),
  to find similar fonts. Again I came close the design I am faced with. The font was
  named \"FF Elementa Rough\". But once again, some details did not match (\"3\").\r\n\r\nIn
  both cases, the \"1\" did not match, but we can imagine that the typer used the
  \"I\" to do the \"1\". So, this difference doesn't have the same importance.\r\n\r\nI
  also used the 'WhatTheFont' search engine and it didn't work.\r\n\r\nAnd the problem
  is that I'm not looking for a digital font that simulates a traditional worn mechanical
  typewriter, but a font produced by a real mechanical typewriter. \r\n\r\nI send
  you a sample of the questioned document as an attachment. If someone knows... It
  could really help me!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nEmmanuelle Sciacca.\r\n"
