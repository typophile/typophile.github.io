    in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fine-Print-Type-Magazine-Typography/dp/096072902X\"
    target=\"new\"><em>Fine Print</em></a> magazine, January 1979.\r\n\r\nOf particular
    note, it was [[Mike Parker]], then director of typographic development for Mergenthaler,
    who made an extensive study of punches and matrices of [[Robert Granjon]]'s (1513--89)
    types found at the <a href=\"http://museum.antwerpen.be/plantin_Moretus/index_eng.html\"
    target=\"new\">Plantin-Moretus Museum</a>.\r\n\r\nTogether, Parker and [[Matthew
    Carter|Carter]] sought the \"best\" of Granjon's faces suitable for contemporary
    typography, making Galliard more of an anthology than a revival of any particular
    type family."

  body: "This is working off the top of my head, so some of the early stuff could
    be in error. The later information is likely correct, as I was a bit involved.\r\n\r\nMatthew
    Carter cut the original Galliard while still at Linotype. I imagine the font was
    licensed to ITC through Linotype. When he & Mike Parker started Bitstream, it
    was likely re-licensed back from ITC (Something similar happened to Sumner Stone
    with the \"Stone clan\"). Or maybe Carter held onto some rights.\r\n\r\nThere
    was a third incarnation when Carter started Carter & Cone. though the Carter &
    Cone fonts are not called \"ITC.\" At some point, a \"Swedish\" version was made,
    which had a slightly different \"f\" so as to fit with vowels with an umlaut better.
    A bit later, Richard Eckersley & I got with Carter to work out tabular old-style
    figures, and I believe a few other glyphs.\r\n\r\nWhile too much a gentleman to
    say so, I believe Matthew is a bit tired of working on Galliard. It's sparkle
    comes from the contrast of the letters; the relation of the fine strokes with
    the heavier ones. Galliard fared better when printed repro-negative-plate than
    direct-to-plate. To date, there has been no reissue of Galliard. I did make a
    slighter more robust version in OpenType --with some extra characters such as
    f-vowel-grave ligatures, and put the nut fractions into a stylistic set. This
    was for our own use, but I did send a copy of the font files to Matthew Carter.
    (We were on a panel at some meeting, & he tacitly agreed that direct-to-plate
    printing was a little hard on the font.) Never did hear back from him on this
    one though, so maybe he disapproved of the changes.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the
    Type 1 Carter & Cone Galliard is to be the final form. For the heavier weights,
    the Bitstream was the final form (to date).\r\n\r\nHope this helps,\r\n\r\nCharles"

  body: "Just an addition of little know information about the development of Galliard--\r\n\r\nThe
    <em>drawing</em> and refinement of the Galliard family was no small task, but
    it is interesting to note that the [[Ikarus]] System was used to interpolate the
    Roman Bold weight, and the Ultra was extrapolated from the Roman and Black weights.
    \r\n\r\nThe italics, on the other hand, were drawn by hand and were based primarily
    on Granjon's Ascendonica Cursive, cut for Plantin in 1570.\r\n(<em>Reference--
    article by Chuck Bigelow on Galliard mentioned in my post above.</em>)"

  body: As far as I know, only the Carter&Cone version has all the alts. I would contact
    ITC to be sure. Unfortunately there isn't really an ITC anymore, so you'll be
    contacting Monotype.

    feature full character maps\u2014but I found this one at Linotype: <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/16783100/itcgalliardproitalic-charactermap.html\">ITC
    Galliard\u2122 Pro Italic</a> (should be the same font, no?), so I took a closer
    look.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can judge from that, you\u2019re perfectly right. Just
    for the record: Most ligatures and swash alternatives were incorporated in the
    OT Pro version, others are missing (among them: alternative ampersand, 2-storey
    g, long-tailed Q, fj/fr/us/as/is-Lig, end swash forms for d, m, e) or look different
    (ij-Lig). Ornaments also only with ITC Galliard CC, I suppose.\r\nThen, with ITC
    Galliard Pro you\u2019d get <em>one</em> font with all the extra stuff comfortably
    accessible, not to mention all the foreign language diacritics.\r\nGrrr, how I
    hate those decisions \u2026"

  body: This is an odd case because I believe Carter added the undigitized extra glyphs
    to his own version after the ITC was released. That's why only the C&C is different.
