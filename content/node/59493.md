  body: "There is a G somewhat like that it an old film type called Weiss Initials
    II, shown on P 123 of the Solotype Catalog, published by Dover. The typeface is
    also shown in the Phil's Photo \"Homage to the Alphabet\". Unfortunately, it is
    only similar, as the serifs are not nearly as prominent (these are more like Bernhard
    Modern), and the letterforms are generally quite different. I think that G made
    me think I had seen this before, but this certainly isn't the same typeface. \r\n\r\nI
    also looked in the Photo-Lettering Catalogs I have, but missed seeing anything
    very similar. Noticing that the proportions of the R in \"LOHENGRIN\" and in \"WAGNER\"
    are not the same, I think that reinforces the hand-lettered idea.\r\n\r\nI think
    this album was from 1960, certainly before digital type, although film (photo)
    lettering was a possibility.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    you are right about that.\r\n\r\nThanks for your input, I'm guessing I'm going
    to have to accept that its hand drawn after all."
