body: "First it was an only Persian / Arabic color font. I have created it with Fontself
  and then 2 other styles with TransType. A lot of colors and a random-shaped font
  for all those Persian glyphs. This was the very first Persian / Arabic font created
  by Fontself too. I did a little trick to do that. Because at the moment (and yet)
  there is no option to add initial, medial, isolated and final glyphs in Fontself.
  It was a fun thing to do actually.\r\n\r\nSo a few days ago, I have released the
  Latin versions too! Now I think it is the first Latin / Persian / Arabic color font
  :)\r\nI hope you like the colors. Lots of colors they have. \r\n\r\nMy Behance and
  Dribbble profiles: @si47ash\r\nWebsites: https://shahabsiavash.com & https://sfonts.ir\r\nAnd
  if you want these fonts I've created a bundle of 8 color fonts here: https://sellfy.com/p/wVaO/\r\n\r\n"
