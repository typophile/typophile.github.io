  to be sister-in-law is excited to have the elaborate swashes in the monogram. Let
  me know what you think of the forms. Thanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DHM7_5616.png]

  body: "It looks like it was poorly live-traced in illustrator. Are you going for
    a more organic letter-form feeling?\r\n\r\nFor me, the forms are too broken up
    by the swashes and don't really look well crafted or well integrated. I'd suggest
    coming up with more variations on this that use different letter placements. For
    examples on swashes and similar letter-forms, I'd suggest looking at the [[http://www.sudtipos.com/home|sudtipos]]
    type foundry. They have a lot of great script fonts with lots of open type options.
    \r\n\r\nAlso, it looks more like D&MH, not D&HM.\r\n\r\npenn"

    the M is overbearing and does make it look like D&MH."

  body: "There is no coherency. It is too much.\r\nIt is more of an illustation. Not
    a well one, I'm afraid.\r\nVery cluttered. Sorry."

  body: "wow, this monogram is a bit hard to read as is.\r\nsize it down to 25% and
    have someone who has never seen it and does not know the couple read it.\r\n\r\nif
    they cannot decipher the letters, you then should reconsider a simpler route."
