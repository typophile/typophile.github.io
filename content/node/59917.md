  from the late 1960s or early 1970s in which the characters were, well, \"characters.\"
  That is, they were letters and numbers who spoke, and the joke was that they were
  puns about themselves. There was no continuity from day to day, just a different
  pun about the characters depicted.\r\n\r\nA couple that I recall:\r\n\r\nThere are
  two capital letters, and the one on the right (a <strong>G</strong>, I believe)
  has a subscript <strong>2</strong> next to it. The letter on the left says, \"Hey,
  George. Who's the cute little number?\"\r\n\r\nA lower-case <strong>e</strong> is
  speaking to an <strong>\xEA</strong> with a circumflex, wearing it like a hat. The
  <strong>e</strong> says to <strong>\xEA</strong>, \"I like it. It's got a certain
  <em>je ne sais quois</em>.\"\r\n\r\nAm I imagining this, or does anyone else remember
  this cartoon? I would love to find examples of it."

  body: "I found it! It was called <em>PIXies</em>, drawn by cartoonist Jack Wohl.
    It was a daily single-panel strip, with Sunday being a series of several single
    panels. [[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2008/02/obscurity-of-day-pixies.html|This
    article]] tells about it. When I was very young, I thought it was hilarious. I
    guess that meant I would grow up to have an appreciation for type.\r\n\r\nSome
    sample Sunday strips I found:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pixies1_6433.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pixies2_6416.jpg]\r\n\r\nApparently
    the strip was popular enough to warrant the creation of bubble gum cards:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pixiescard1_4247.jpg]
    \ [img:sites/default/files/old-images/pixiescard2_6043.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. Wohl
    also collected some of his work into a book back in the '60s. (It sold for $1
    back then. Amazon.com has used copies now for $5.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pixiesbook_4748.jpg]"
