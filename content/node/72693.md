  in FontLab.\r\n\r\nthank you"

  body: Have you tried the "Mark problems" macro available from the Font window? Just
    right-click in any of the glyphs (to get the contextual menu) and select Macro
    > Mark problems. Don't know what each color means.

  body: "As far as I know, the Mark Problems macro doesn\u2019t mark any overlapping
    contours, but rather the problems considered as such by Font Audit, i. e., Empty
    lines and curves, Vector on closepaths, Flat curves, Collinear vectors, Inflection
    on curves, Weak extremum points, Normal extremum points, Incorrect smooth connection,
    Cusp and self-intersecting curves, Semi-horizontal and vertical vectors, Contour
    is not closed & Object is too short.\r\n\r\nAs for the colors, they indicate how
    big are the problems and/or how many problems the glyph has. Red means a big problem
    or many minor things to fix, pale yellow means \u201Cdon\u2019t worry too much\u201D."

  body: I don't know how to that in FontLab but if you generate a font and open it
    in FontForge, it will give a warning for every glyph with overlaps. You could
    than mark those glyphs in FL. I agree it is not the best and most easy way...
