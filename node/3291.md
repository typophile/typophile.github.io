    border=0> <BR> <BR>Looks like a poor man&#39;s version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/latin/mt-condensed/testdrive.html?s=KINDERGARTEN&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank"> Latin Elongated</a> or  <BR>something like that. The N is completely
    out of balance <BR>for example.

  body: I&#39;m afraid this will be impossible to find, free or otherwise. <BR>Can&#39;t
    you draw the kiddies on an existing typeface? Pick  <BR>one of the 3736 free ones
    at <a href="http://www.dafont.com/" target="_blank"> Dafont</a>.

  body: Adam, <BR>Do you need specifically this font? If, rather, it&#39;s just the
    kids theme you&#39;re after, <BR>check <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/skyscraper/dos/1232/page06achildren.html"
