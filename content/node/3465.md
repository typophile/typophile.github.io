  body: The magazine talks about how to live life in a simple way, with gardening,
    catering and dressing tips. It has a very clean design, with lots o white. There
    for the type to be used needs to be very light and thin. There is no budget in
    mind....yet :-&#41;  <BR> <BR>

  body: Alex did you by any chance look at any Font Bureau fonts like Hermes. They
    make very good publication fonts. The other Foundry to check out is Terminal Design,
    their Giacomo and Clearview are beauties.
