    lettering on the replica on Gizmodo is pretty close, but not identical. In both
    cases the lettering is just crudely drawn, not any typeface I've ever seen. It's
    sort of similar to Korinna, but it's hard to tell if that was on purpose. \r\n\r\nI
    would recommend tracing from the video frame. Short of getting hold of the prop,
    that's about as close as you're going to get."

    ended up using Korinna for the base and tweaked it from there...\r\n\r\nHere's
    how it looks, sending off to get a vinyl printed now :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Top_3417.jpg]"
