<div class=commentbody> Joe, Mrs Eaves has some great ligs, but don't make the same mistake of going overboard: avoid monstrosities like that italic "py" at all costs... <br> <br>Classica is a supreme example of how to do it, and I'd also mention Carter's Mantinia. <br> <br>BTW, when directed properly, the design/use of ligs can also improve functionality, not just aesthetics. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> About the "functionality" bit: You might consider letter pairs/sequences which are frequent, not just ligation-candidates based on looks/structure. <br> <br>The 30 most frequent letter pairs in English are: <br>th he an in er re es on ea ti <br>at st en nd or to nt ed is ar <br>ou te of it ha se et al ri ng <br> <br>The 20 in German: <br>en er ch de ge ei ei in ne nd <br>be el te un st di no ue se au <br> <br>etc. <br> <br>hhp </div>

<div class=commentbody> There are some letter combinations that are more common in the swedish language, like: <br> <br>sk <br>sch <br>ch <br>sj <br>fj <br>ck <br>tj <br>tt <br>gg <br>ll <br>nn <br>tt <br>pp <br>mm <br> <br>and probably more... <br> <br>also I would imagine in <br>finnish = kk <br>dutch = oo <br> <br> <br>Is there similar combinations in other languages <br>that never or seldom appear in "english/american" ligature sets? <br> <br>/peter </div>

<div class=commentbody> That's interesting Hrant, <br>do you know any url where one <br>could find more letter pairs for <br>other languages? <br> <br>I guess if one would make a different ligature set <br>for different languages then English, German, Spanish and French would be the first choices? <br> <br> <br>/peter </div>

<div class=commentbody>Peter and Hrant, those character <br>combinations are a valuable bit of information. <br>Thanks. <br> <br>Mrs Eaves and Classica seem to take two <br>different approaches. Mrs Eaves tends to <br>connect characters while Classica likes to <br>share strokes... (I'm speaking in broad <br>generalities). Does the sharing of strokes <br>help or hinder readability? That lowercase "ir" <br>combo seems like a stretch. <br> <br>Mrs Eaves <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/522.gif alt="Mrs Eaves ligature"> <br> <br>Classica <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/523.gif alt=Classica> <br> <br> <br>//joe</div>

<div class=commentbody> Peter, is that list off the top of your head? If so, it's still helpful, thanks, but could you possibly find something official/methodical for Swedish? That would be great. And even more important than pairs would be word frequencies. All my own data comes from cryptographic and linguistic analysis, which I have access to thanks to UCLA. Except for the Polish data which I can thank Adam Twardoch for. I've been wanting to put it all up on my site, but... <br> <br>BTW, here's an idea: Could we have some kind of repository here on Typophile, where people submit frequency lists (with info about the source)? That would be killer. I'd contribute whatever I had (as long as I find the time to type it in... Or maybe I can do OCR). <br> <br>Ligature Style: <br>The difference comes from the fact that Thierry is an accomplished calligrapher. And although I'm not a big fan of calligraphy in type design, if tempered it results in some great ligatures, that's for sure. Yeah, some of them are pretty crazy, but remember that you never *have* to use a given ligature, but in any case each one is aesthetically superb. If you look at the "AA" in Mrs Eaves, for example, you can see it doesn't really "sit" very well. In terms of functionality, however, we could argue about which is better: constructed or painted ligatures. And of course that applies to type in general. I happen to think paint is for walls. <br> <br>Linguistic Hierarchy: <br>In terms of Latinate writing systems, the main ones would be, in ~order: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Italian, and after that I wouldn't try to guess. But note that you might consider this order to be somewhat moot, because, for example: there's less piracy in Germany than in general; on the web Dutch has a disproportionate presence; and other factors. <br> <br>BTW, concerning "customizing" for languages, more important than ligatures would be spacing/kerning: it can have a very large effect on setting. For example, round-round shape-pairs have a very different frequency in English and French. And in English the word "the" is more common than fully *half* the letters of the alphabet, whereas since it's not as common in Spanish, you might sacrifice its spacing in favor of the "ate" string, for example. <br> <br>hhp </div>
