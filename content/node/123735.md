  several years ago. I'm hoping somebody can help us identify the font. It looks familiar
  to me, like a default font that would have installed on a Mac or PC in the past,
  but I cannot find it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help.\r\nKen\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wls-website-font_4069.jpg]"

    perhaps?:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/peignot/\r\n\r\nMight also
    be Inegale:\r\nhttp://www.psyops.com/shop/inegale/inegale-set/"

    I\u2019m not seeing a gap between the stem and bowl of the |R| on your sample,
    as in Peignot, that may just be a function of the type size and anti-aliasing."

  body: "Hmm, I think you're right. I'm going to go with that, and adjust the letter
    height, spacing and faux bold in Photoshop to match what we currently have.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again! So glad to have found this site.\r\n\r\nKen"
