body: "I am making a font for a chinese music instrument's tablature. It's a CJK ideograph
  based font. First of all, there are glyph that are out of the unicode prescribed
  glyph, but I have to code them in some fashion. Therefore, many of those glyph is
  in the private use range. Second, it seems like the script named <hani> does not
  support features like <calt> and so on. But i desperately need that. Third, I dont
  know what script am I suppose to use when the font falls mainly into the private
  use range. So, is there a way to code at least half of my glyph (which has a total
  of 1800) and still able to use feature like <calt> ? Thanks in advance. A sample
  of what is happening is attached, but all coded in the CJK range NOT the private
  use range YET.\r\n\r\nI have posted in VOLT MSNgroup but no one reply. Thankx in
  advance."

    different text engines approach script identification in different ways.

  body: mkmk, mark, calt and ccmp is all I needed for now. calt is a large part of
    the font. I would like to use it in wordpad and other uniscribe-able application
    in Windows environment. P.S. I am sorry that I didn't know I can't put anything
    inside "<>"s
