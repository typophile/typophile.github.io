    frustrated by computers! <BR> <BR>I know you have heard about M&amp;H Type &#40;Arion
    Press&#41;. They are very good, and have a large selection of both US and UK Monotype
    faces. They cast from 6 point to 72 point, using Monotype composition casters,
    Orphan Annies, Thompsons and Giant Casters. <BR> <BR>Some of the type, including
    all 6 to 12 points and in some cases, 14 to 24 pt, are cast in a softer Monotype
    metal.   <BR> <BR>To be sure, this is not true foundry type, but will serve well
    if not overimpressed on a soft packing. <BR> <BR>All of the Thompson Caster and
    Giant Caster type is done in hard metal, and is very good indeed. Their catalogue
    is coded to let you know what is &#34;foundry cast&#34; and what is softer composition-cast
    type. <BR> <BR>You could look up Michael and Winnifred Bixler in the Eastern US.
    They are casting many UK Monotype faces, including those of Gill, Van Krimpen,
    and Mardersteig etc. <BR>They will tell you what their metal alloy is made up
    of. <BR> <BR>The Rehak of the Dale Guild is casting in hard metal, using Barth
    Casters which he aquired from American Type Founders at their liquidation. In
    addition he has some of their legendary Benton pantographs, and has recut a handful
    of Goudy&#39;s Textura faces; Mediaeval, Franciscan, and Deepdene Text. His work
    is superb, and the castings are the best in the world. <BR> <BR>My selection of
    faces s a very small one, geared to what I need at my press for the books I print.
    I have cut a handful of my own private faces, in single sizes, and have made them
    available in the past. At present I am in the midst of setting a very large text,
    and have no time to cast, so I think your best bet is the names I have given you.
    <BR> <BR>Be cautious about buying used type. Some of it is can be short of certain
    characters, and in some cases it can be worn and beaten up. Buying new is the
    wisest step. <BR> <BR>You will find M&amp;H and Dale Guild on the internet. <BR>

  body: "Hrant:\r\n\r\n[[Theo Rehak]] of the Dale Guild is the man to speak to about
    the disposition of the ATF equipment. The sad news is that the junkmen were standing
    by at the auction a few years ago, and the largest part of the battery of fifty
    or so Barth casters and the hand and steam pivotal (Bruce-like machines) were
    trucked off for scrap. A part of the holding of matrices met the same fate. The
    scope of the machinery (weight) was just too overwhelming for the average person
    to cart away. Barth casters went for about twenty-five dollars. Benton pantographs
    for a few hundred dollars. Most of the six Bentons were saved and trucked off
    by people who are, fortunately, using them.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that about
    twenty or so Barth casters were saved and are being used by enthusiasts. A large
    part of the matrices were also saved by several individuals.\r\n\r\n[[Rich Hopkins]]
    of the Hill and Dale Letter Foundry in Terra Alta WV has rescued a lot of them.
    Some he has cast in recent years.\r\n\r\n[[Greg Walters]] of Piqua, Ohio has a
    few of the Barth Casters from the sale, and I believe a small selection of the
    Matrices.\r\n\r\n[[Dan Carr]], who operates the Golgonooza (this is a real name)
    Letter Foundery in Ashuelot, NH has a Large point size Kustermann caster that
    had been used by Theo for a few years. He passed it on the Dan, who by the way,
    is a hand punchcutter, and has done a lovely 16 point roman book face.\r\n\r\nAnother
    man who can give you lots of information is [[Stan Nelson]], who is a printing
    historian/technician at the Smithsonian Museum of Modern History, and is also
    a punchcutter. He has been archiving a few tons of the ATF matrices which were
    given to the Smithsonian in, I think, the mid-seventies. These mats are from the
    ATF \"housecleaning\" of afew decades ago. Apparently they were presented to the
    Smithsonian as a dumped pile, which was loaded with snow shovels to take away.
    The story is that they suffered little damage by this treatment.\r\n\r\n[[Paul
    Duensing]] in Watkinsville GA is truly the dean of avocational typefounding in
    the world. He has so much knowledge of the status of the matrix holdings of the
    great foundries of Europe. About 15 years ago he cut a 30 pt Civilite for Hermann
    Zapf. Harold Berliner, Nevada City, CA made me a gift of a font for lending them
    one of my home-made matrix holders so that they could cast a subscription of 30
    fonts. Paul is also a close friend of Schumaker Gebler (forgive my spelling of
    his name) who has a boggling matrix collection from Stempel, Enschede and other
    foundries, along with a large functioning battery of foundry casters. Last month
    I received a gorgeous little brochure from Germany and since I speak no German,
    I could only sort of guess that it was announcing the final opening of the big
    Foundry Museum in Germany. I will dig it up . . . in the foundry somewhere.\r\n\r\nOne
    parting item: [[Chris Stern]] of Grey Spider Press in Sedro Wooley, WA came up
    to visit me yersterday for the purpose of cutting hanging figs to go with Futura.
    We got all the patterns cut, and the two rough cuts on all of the matrices. Next
    week we will do the final finish cut. Chris, incidentally, has five or six Monotype
    caster, about half of them recondiitoned and operating. He casts type for the
    School of Visual Concepts in Seattle. They have a very lively program.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are interested in contacting any of these people, give me your Email address,
    and I will get you contact info on these folks. You have your work cut out for
    you in tracking the ATF material. The good part is that any of it that exists
    is in the hand of some known person, you just have to pull it all together.\r\n\r\nThis
    got a little wordy, but there is a lot going on in metal foundry these days.\r\n\r\nJim

  body: Another person who was at the ATF auction and may have information is David
    Pankow at the Carey Collection at RIT. He gave an interesting and at times moving
    lecture about the rise and fall of ATF at the 1994 ATypI conference in San Francisco,
    culminating in his description of the auction. The scrap dealers were indeed standing
    by, and seem to have carried of the bulk of the stuff, including many matrices.
    Pankow himself was able to save a few designs for the Carey Collection, I believe.

  body: 'I can&#39;t quite recall whether Rich Hopkins got the ATF matrices for Garamond
    or Baskerville, but I seem to remember that he has one series of the other. You
    might want to check it out. <BR> <BR>Other happenings: I have recently completed
    the cutting of Matrices for Carl Dair&#39;s Cartier Roman. I have had the patterns
    which I made for both the Roman and Italic just sitting around the foundry for
    a few years. Just didn&#39;t have the time to get to cutting punches, which was
    my original intent. <BR> <BR>In May of this year I was slated to make a presentation
    to the Type Club of Toronto, and shamed myself into getting back on the Cartier.
    Not enough time to cut punches, so I made another &#40;intaglio&#41; set of patterns
    at a 12-1 scale and cut direct mats. I&#39;ll get around to cutting the French
    accents after October. Since the mats were angraved directly, it is necessary
    to hand dress all the letters as they come off the caster. Poo! <BR> <BR>If you
    are into  little type news: I took a graduating Graphic Design student from Emily
    Carr Inst. on for a semester of Mondays. He wanted to further his type knowledge.
    I dropped him in at the deep end of the pool, and suggested that he engrave a
    small type project. <BR> <BR>He selected Victor Hammer&#39;s American Uncial.
    We came to the conclusion that if he did only the lowercase and a cap I, along
    with the punctuation and figs, that he could complete the project. <BR> <BR>I
    taught him the bare-bones basics of Fontographer, and he made his outlines with
    it. Using FWG&#39;s method, he cut bristol board patterns, which were then engraved
    at 2-1 into lead plate. These were used to cut the 14 point mats. <BR> <BR>In
    the end, he took away his patterns, the mats and a case of type. The last two
    days were used up in his setting and printing a limited edition broadsheet with
    the type. This bright young man&#39;s name is Dale Davies. Following his project,
    another student came for five weeks to do the same thing. I felt the time was
    too tight, so we settled on her cutting a glyph of her name Kan. In this case
    she freehanded the drawing from an existing Chinese glyph, and following the same
    steps cut a mat in 18 point. I steered her into recutting another pattern flopped
    so that she could print it on her broadseet as a faint grey image, along with
    the 18 point type. <BR> <BR>Both students were very tweeked about carrying on
    at a later date on their own. This is very possible since the machines for cutting
    type are dirt cheap. <BR> <BR>The purpose of my writing this here is to mention
    that I would like to have, at least one year,  two or three interetsed people
    come and spend two days with me to learn the basics of the process. I think the
    most logical thing would be to have them design and cut a dingbat/leaf, or the
    like, in 18 point. This could easily be done over two days. <BR> <BR>There would
    be no charge, and there is affordable B&amp;B spots in the neighborhood. <BR>
    <BR>Somebody ought to take me up on this, becasue I am not getting younger, and
    I would dearly like to see the craft carry on. In the final analysis, the knowledge
    that one picks up is not geared solely to letterpress; at least that&#39;s the
    way I see it. <BR> <BR>Sorry for the crazy digression. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer <BR>

    in establishing a date, based upon you being able to get here&#41; and another
    in the Spring of 2004. This would be about late April or early May. Again this
    will need to be worked out with potential attendees. Probably the best thing would

  body: Gerald, <BR> <BR>Nothing wrong with Coquitlam. I have a brother out there.
    I would be without a car. Do you live there? <BR> <BR>Maybe we could link up.
    I just hadn&#39;t thought about going that way. Usually I stay on Commercial Drive
    with one of my sons, or Squamish with the other.  <BR> <BR>Gee, they cut the ivy
    down. <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR> <BR> <BR>
