body: "After hearing for so many years how much better Fontographer's change weight
  feature was than FontLab's emboldening, I downloaded the new Fontographer 5 demo
  to try it out. Clearly, the outline transformation algorithm used by Fontographer
  is superior in that there is much less distortion and a much cleaner result, but
  still... this is a weight change feature programmed by someone who has never designed
  a typeface and knows nothing about letterforms. Any weight change function that
  is only capable of adding the same amount of weight in both the x and y direction
  is completely useless. Any weight change feature that only offers the options to
  preserve existing height and/or width is similarly useless.\r\n\r\nThe interface
  for Karsten Luecke's Glyph Tweaker script for FontLab Studio shows what a real weight
  change feature should provide:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kltxgt_6580.png]\r\n.\r\nFirst,
  there are independent controls of height and width that not only allow one to fix
  those, if one wishes, but more importantly enable one to intelligently adjust them
  as part of the outline transformation. The height control is particularly clever,
  because it enables one to identify a particular outline feature height and adjust
  everything else relative to this. So, for instance, you might adjust or fix the
  x-height, and not run into the silly situation produced by the Fontographer weight
  change feature in which, if overall height is fixed, the x-height of glyphs that
  start as the same end up different:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/foggybold_6149.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  ability to independently change the x and y stem weight, rather than adding/subtracting
  a global amount obviously makes much more sense given that type is very seldom truly
  monolinear.\r\n\r\nNow, the KLTF Glyph Tweaker is not perfect, in large part because
  it relies on some FontLab Studio outline tranformation functions that sometimes
  results in outline kinks that require a lot of manual cleanup. But if something
  like Karsten's tweak UI could be married to Fontographer's cleaner outline transformation
  algorithm, then perhaps we'd be approaching a real weight change feature.\r\n\r\nI
  say approaching, because ultimately a weight change feature should also understand
  diagonals and be informable about design topology, e.g. by enabling the user to
  identify typical hairline or bowl-to-stem weight thicknesses and have these independently
  adjusted too, regardless of whether they are horizontal, vertical or diagonal features."

    as Fontographer.

    is partly untrue. The weight change function of Fontographer is extremely useful,
    if a font prints too light. In many typefaces the contrast is too high in my opinion.
    So it absolutely doesn\u2019t matter, that the function reduces the contrast,
    if you make a font bolder. But you cannot simply create a bold weight with it,
    that\u2019s true."

    very much like emboldening in FontLab. But FontForge also has a \"Change Glyph\"
    tool, which provides the same features as the Glyph Tweaker script (as far as
    I can conlude from John's screenshot) and a bit more. In particular, it is possible
    to manipulate alignment zones, thus changing vertical glyph proportions. There
    is also a diagonal width control. Of course the result should always be corrected

  body: "Mark >It is possible to transform glyphs before making a weight change, and

    problem with all the transformations, including change weight when the point structures
    are not compromised, is that they don't \"know\" the difference between one x
    thing and the next, the difference between one y thing and the next, much less
    the connecting things between the things, (going by Stone's terminology of letter
    parts). \r\n\r\nI just finished 10 of these boldenings, boldening for web text
    boldness which is more than most. They all followed a similar pattern of; scale,
    (slant some), and then grab the right subset of the contour points, from a ball
    terminal, up to the whole x-ht, scale them tiny amounts, tweak multitudes of points
    2-5 units to complete the gross coordinates, before micro-tweak for shape.\r\n\r\nWe
    also recently did 4 other boldenings using lost-in-the-mist technology and these
    were different. There is a moment to select values for the axes while thinking
    about going to the beach, and then a moment to process while mixing ice cocoa,
    and then it's right to micro-tweaking shapes. Yes, you have to make the decisions
    up front on Ultra and Thin, (telling the software about the extreme whereabouts
    of all the x and y and other things), but then you can go to the beach and phone
    in your weights.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"
