  a fair few that come close, but not perfect.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a name/link
  to where I can get this from?\r\n\r\nMassive thanks in advance."

    unless special substitutions are made. Handwriting comes right out of a hand and
    a pen. That''s what this is. If you need a handwriting font, search for "handwriting"
    on your favorite font sites. '

  body: "It's definitely not actually handwritten.\r\n\r\nAt work earlier I had access
    to several other pictures with various other things written on them using the
    same font and they were all consistently shaped. There is definitely a font out
    there the same as this."

  body: Can you show us the other samples? More words would be helpful in both identifying
    the 'font' and convincing the skeptics.

  body: Hmmm, we'll need some serious convincing indeed, because this <em>definitely</em>
    looks handwritten.

  body: Just to state the obvious, part of the reason there's so much skepticism is
    due to the connector positions. This would have to be a very involved OpenType
    font to simulate the "random" connectors found in your sample. For example, the
    "on" combination connects up top, the "su" a bit lower, the "an" quite tight and
    lower still, and the "co" and "cy" connections are also at different levels. When
    drawing a script type the connectors are always drawn to a grid, at the same level,
    so that any character combination will "fit." Some OpenType fonts will have substitutions
    to create the illustion of randomness, but this sample is just too random to believe
    that it's a font. It has nothing to do with how "casual" the characters look,
    it's how they fit together that leads to the conclusion that this is actually
    handwriting.

  body: Isn't it possible that the other samples you came across were handwritten
    by the same person, hence the consistency?

  body: "I agree with all the assertions that this is probably handwritten, but the
    point should be do we know of a font that looks like this. I think it looks an
    awful lot like a font called <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script09Pg3.html\"
