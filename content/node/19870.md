body: "Ok ABC networks, what kind of font game are you playing?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/10800_5925.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor
  those who have been tracking <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/17398\" target=\"new\">typefaces
  and icons on the ABC tv series LOST</a>, we now have a new entity to decipher: <a
  href=\"http://www.hansorg.com/\" target=\"new\">The Hanso Foundation</a>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lost-hansofoundation_3930.jpg]\r\n\r\nSeems
  that a series of seemingly inoccuous short tv spots running lately delivering somewhat
  half \"New Age\" healthy spirit and beneficial corporate foundation will help the
  word messages, pointing you to a phone number where no one answers... is just part
  of ABC's marketing scheme to build greater interest in the show LOST!\r\n\r\nNot
  only are they playing with the general tv viewers, but they're playing with nerdy
  typophiles like you and me!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hansologo2_5888.jpg]\r\nWhy
  mix weights of Helvetica with Helvetica Condensed and Futura all in the same logo?
  To confuse and intrigue us into watching more episodes of LOST!\r\n\r\nPlease correct
  me if I'm wrong about the typefaces (that's why you're reading this in the Type
  ID section).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dharmasmall_4742.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "I think you've got the fonts identified.\r\n\r\nMaybe the designers wanted
    to use Helvetica for the Hanso foundation logo to set it apart from the Futura
    normally associated with Lost. However, the 'O' in \"HANSO\" could not be Helvetica
    because Helvetica's oval-shaped 'O' wouldn't work with the yin-yang-style circular
    logo, so they reverted back to Futura. Since \"FOUNDATION\" has two 'O's in it,
    they may have wanted to use Futura so the 'O's wouldn't look out of place.\r\n\r\nWhy
    is the 'S' heavier than the rest? Only the polar bears know...\r\n\r\n - Lex\r\n\r\n<cite>EDIT:
    I just noticed the 'H' is in Futura as well... this makes it H, AN, S, O in different
    weights/fonts. What does it mean?</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>EDIT 2: FOUNDation - for
    a show called LOST - coincidence?</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>EDIT 3: If you re-arrange
    the letters in HANSO it spells OSHAN which sounds like ocean - which is where
    the island is... spooky.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>EDIT 4: I need to get some sleep.</cite>"
