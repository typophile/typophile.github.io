body: "I\u2019m looking for a lily ornament, in the same style as [[http://www.briarpress.org/978|this
  rose]] from Briar Press. Ornament might be the wrong term, as this is more real
  looking than most ornaments. It doesn\u2019t have to be free, but it wouldn\u2019t
  hurt either. I\u2019m doing some wedding programmes for a friend for no charge,
  and I\u2019ve already spent way to much time on them. I had my eyes set on that
  rose, but they decide they wanted a lily in the last minute.\r\n\r\nA link to someone
  skilled in drawing these kind of ornaments would also be appreciated."

    a few of the stock sites that are usually known/used for photos also have illustrations.
    I find they can be worth checking for such cases. iStockphoto has quite a bunch
    of lilies (make sure to only check \xABIllustrations\xBB in the dropdown next
    to the \xABSearch\xBB button if you do a search)."

  body: "I agree with the iStockPhoto suggestion; it's probably the quickest and easiest
    solution. \r\n\r\nBut if they don't have what you want, another approach would
    be to check out the stock art books by Dover Publications (http://store.doverpublications.com/).
    They have several books of flower illustrations which are copyright free, and
    many libraries and bookstores have their books. Some of their clip art is also
    sold on CDs."

  body: Thanks, guys. The top right one looks promising, Mili. Any legalities I should
    consider?

  body: The text in the book says that the pictures can be used free of charge for
    various decorating purposes. As I own this book, surely I can let you borrow one
    picture? I can try to send you a bigger version by email.
