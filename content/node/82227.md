  body: "The italics look like Jaeger's <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/daily-news-pro/\">Daily
    News</a>, but the HARRY GOW lettering is only similar to that font. It's either
    something else, or it's been customized a lot, because the R and W are not like
    Daily News.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
