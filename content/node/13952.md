body: "PageMaker was the first major desktop publishing application for personal computers,
  first released in 1985 by [[Aldus]]. With the advent of [[PostScript]], users were
  able to create their own multi-page documents that combined text and graphics. Though
  PageMaker was overtaken by [[QuarkXPress]] in the early 1990s as the industry standard,
  [[Adobe Type|Adobe]] took over PageMaker when it bought Aldus in 1995. Though Adobe's
  primary page-layout application is now [[Adobe InDesign|InDesign]], PageMaker is
  still part of Adobe's product line.\r\n\r\nURL: <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/pagemaker/main.html\">http://www.adobe.com/products/pagemaker/</a>"
