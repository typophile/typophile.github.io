<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm looking for some advice for dealing with a difficult client!
There's this dry brochure we're doing that contains tons and tons of text. In an effort to mix things up, we've done some funky titles, using the three or four words of the title at different sizes. These are short and very obvious titles. (I've attached one.)
Anyway, one of staff for the client always cites "legibility" concerns (mostly when I think he really just doesn't like something). And in a presentation, I'm suddenly left facing a group of non-design-savvy people who respond, "oh, do you think this will be legible?"
I guess I feel like any design suggestions I'm making are getting trumped by this legibility card.
(In one example, the block of very bold text was crossed by a light grey hairline. It was incredibly clear what the text said, but there it was again -- "do you think that line over the text makes it hard to read? Is it legible?" Honestly...!)
Basically, if the text isn't level, the same size, or being read directly from upper left to lower right, I can be certain that someone will cite "legibility" concerns. I'd rather not throw in the towel and just create a boring, conservative piece, because it's not right for the overall brand. Any suggestions on how I can counter-argue the legibility stonewall?
I've considered pulling out my old David Carson books and saying "No, THIS is hard to read. What I' doing is easy..." Help!</div>

<div class=commentbody>>There’s this dry brochure we’re doing that contains tons and tons of text.
Why do you wanna be "funky" here? Does the impression you get from the layout really needs something like a "magazine headline" or can you solve it in another way - what else did you try? Can you show some "dry textlayout" for comparision?
In my taste, i would dislike All-Versal-in different sizes as an "attention-getter", too.

<div class=commentbody>A better way of phrasing the question back is, "Which words can't you read?" The responsent will typically read the words aloud making it clear that he read them just fine. A better tact is showing them the bottom line advantage in better product recognition or some sales advantage that comes with your treatment of the text.
The truth is, you just may have a client who is too conservative for anything but the most basic design. Often times, it is not worth the extra time it takes to show numerous revisions to an unwilling client. Some people just like their Pizza plain.

<div class=commentbody>I don't think this is a 'legibility' issue, since the characters display at a large enough size to be legible and the colour, though muted, still offers good contrast with the page.
I think this is a 'readability' issue, since the thought of the phrase is broken over four lines. But, still, I read it quite easily. I would even say *very* easily.
And I further think your treatment offers a good counterpoint to a <em> dry brochure with tons and tons of text.</em>
'Legibility" IS a trump card, and if raised, needs to be addressed. In this case, I would second darrel's comment.
And don't show Carson to your client. If they're having trouble with your design treatment, they'll freak over Carson.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't know if I'm going to answer the question. I also don't mean to offend anyone.
But...
In an instance where the client sites any kind of issue related to the design of his information you need to see it as a challenge to come back with something that answers both your desire to make the blah more interesting and make their test more readable.
I wouldn't site any research. The client might become insulted.
So I guess I'm saying that you shouldn't give up on adding some visual interest, but that you haven't found the right solution yet.</div>

Yes, avoid actual content at all costs. Ideally, use the Uniglyph writing system:

<div class=commentbody>In your example (spring shoes) my beef is that you emphasize BRAND over NEW - maybe that's what the client is objecting to. I'd think NEW should jump way out.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I can see how someone might have concerns about this specific example, at least. The placement of 'new' is ambiguous: when I first looked at it, I read it as 'new brand', and had to stop and wonder what it meant before I realised that I'd misread it. So while it's clearly not <em>il</em>legible, there's certainly a sense in which it could be <em>more</em> legible.
One possible approach might be to use your funky titles decoratively while ensuring that there is also something less funky that conveys the same information. Then legibility ceases to be a valid concern at all.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Furthermore, you're always going to have to deal with clients who have some pretty strict idee-fixe's about design. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. My experience is that it's never easy to talk them out of their ideas (see this thread too: http://typophile.com/node/28056) but best to embrace the challenge of trying to make something attractive and effective within the limitations they impose.</div>

<div class=commentbody>same thing happened to me as with haelenth,
for some reason the 1st word i read was the "new", making the sentence read "new brand spring shoes"
im guessing its the "new"`s contrast in weight that makes it look optically lighter, sort of a highlight if you may.
i think its legible,
just isnt streamlined...
sometimes for me,text that is a bit quirky to read makes it that much more interesting to try and read and in the end, it packs extra punch to leave an impression.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If you use hackneyed typefaces you will run into this kind of trouble. In order to put the stamp of creativity onto the work, you are obliged to come up with some fancy treatment - dropshadow being the most egregious, but here it's a Patrick Mitchell 1998 (Fast Company) thing -- this is where the designer adds value. An alternative would be to put the interest in a more discriminating choice of typeface (after all, there are 100,000 available) perhaps even, dare it be said, something contemporary? If Futura is the mandated corporate face, that's sad. It was, as Herr Renner noted, the typeface of his time. But perhaps 2007 spring shoes are gonna be retro 1927...
<em>sometimes for me,text that is a bit quirky to read makes it that much more interesting to try and read and in the end, it packs extra punch to leave an impression.</em>
That's a great argument. Legibility is more a text thing, but for heads, which are more left brain than right, you want to create just enough "difficultas" to catch the readers' attention, slow them down, and interest them in the content.</div>

Yep, I was thinking the same, throw some visual perception theory back at your clients. I'm sure there are some good examples you can show them, stuff that contains some little tiny imperfections that make the head so much more interesting and most importantly: it makes the text stay longer in your memory.
In any case: it's not worth crucifying yourself. I don't want to say that all clients are idiots and that they need to be educated and blah blah blah but once I went through a horrible crisis and felt really bad about myself because of a similar situation. I'm sure it happens to everyone.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks everyone for the feedback. This has been, and will continue to be, an ongoing problem with this client.
It's mostly frustrating to deal with someone who views design as superfluous ornament to the "very important text" and not as an essential part of the project. (Insert the standard "cry me a river" that designers are not valued in some clients' eyes.)
I think Nick and Lore provided me with the most helpful points about the value in including some "difficultas" to draw attention, and discussing the value of varried pace. Thanks again to everyone who took the time to post.
ps. I must confess that the "Spring Shoes" example wasn't from the actual project (since it's embargoed) -- I just quickly whipped up to demonstrate the point. The real work is much nicer, and not Futura. :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I wish all of you had read my post of about three months ago about legibility stansarda for corporate communicatins in the design forum. If you have time please take a look.
My eyes (one doesn't work at all) need help. I read annual reports that are monuments to the designers ego rathere than a help to communication. I need a set of standards, actual examples of good work tht can be read with ease by 95 % of the adult population, so that I can send it with a copy of the chairman's statement back to him as a minimun standard of legibility. Does such a standard exist?
Theory doesn't help the man buying the printing. Concrete examples in increasing legibility are needed with which to compare the work proposed. Is any body working on such standards?
I'l talk to anybody at any hour who can help in this. 212-222-8751
A related question. What is the best font for statistical material? Which font has the most legible digits?
