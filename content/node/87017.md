  body: "Millenium will probably take the position that he is suing the wrong company.
    Millenium didn't hire him, they hired Technicolor. He was a contract worker being
    paid by Technicolor.\r\n\r\nSo he may end up having to sue Technicolor, but since
    they did pay him a fee and he had no written contract which specified he get paid
    more if his concept is picked, he may be out of luck. I guess the lesson is to
    always get it in writing."
