  the characters in the lower case properly, but when generated into a font some of
  the characters display in a rather distorted way, dependant on character size displaying.\r\nIt
  usually happens to the lower r, n, h. sometimes the a or the s.\r\n\r\nLarger displayed
  sized the problem goes away, but it also seemt to happen in documents.\r\nEven though
  my explanation is confusing, does anyone have an idea what is wrong. \r\n\r\nI have
  attached an image someone has supplied me with to illustrate the problem"

  body: It looks like a [[hinting]] problem. Are you using FontLab? Did you try Auto
    Hinting?

    there. Was going to attach the font itself, but this doesnt seem possible (zip
    file)\r\n\r\nHave sent a demo of the font to alt.binaries font  (NOTE : this is
    NOT alt.binaries fonts, this newsgroup is not used by anyone other than junk posts)
    if anyone wants to see the problem firsthand\r\n"

    problem, but funnily the autohint in Fontlab didnt correct it, but the autohint
    in Fontographer did. Weird.\r\n"

    all glyphs, (2) Automatically calculate alignment zones in Font Info, (3) Automatically
    calculate standard stems in Font Info. Just autohinting won't correct the problem.

  body: "Postscript Autohinting is far away from perfect. If you take a look at some
    other fonts you notice that these kind of problems are almost always there, more
    or less anyway.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve experimented a lot with this lately and found
    out that if you only autohint the vertical stems, it can sometimes can work very
    good \u2013 you get sharper appearance on screen but this typical horizontal distorsion
    is not there (when letters jump up and down).\r\n\r\nTake a look at this thread
    for more hinting stuff.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/31448\r\n\r\n/ G\xF6ran\r\n\r\nPS.
    <cite>Just to give you more examples:</cite> I also spotted the same issue on
    another thread lately that don\u2019t really speaks about hints, but as an example
    \u2013 look at the \"t\", \"u\" and \"e\" on Freight Micro Bold on this thread:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/31816"

  body: "Mr Twardoch\r\nThanks for your observations and suggestions. I got home and
    went to fix up the original font file here with your suggestions, and got absolutely
    nowhere. I followed your steps four times and the problem persisted every time.\r\nWhipped
    out Fontographer and autohinted. Problem still slightly there so started over
    with Fontographer. 1. automated vert align zones then 2 . Autohinted. Problem
    cleared up. Could be just this font of mine, but confused an out of date program
    fixed the problem while Fontlab seems to stutter on it.\r\n\r\nOut of pure stubborness,
    took the corrected font and in Fontlab, followed your steps again. It recreated
    all the visual problems in the corrected font.\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
