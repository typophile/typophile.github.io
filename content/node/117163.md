body: "This is some lettering for a church sign. It was installed many years ago,
  and over time, they lost some of the letters. They replaced them with a different
  font, but decided they wanted to revert back to this one. However, nobody knows
  what font it is. \r\nI\u2019m having trouble finding a font that matches the \u201CR\u201D
  and the numbers.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nIn the second
  picture, it's the serif font, not the sans serif numbers on the right. "
