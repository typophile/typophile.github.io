  body: "SiFR takes the ASCII text on the page as it's source. AFAIK, there wouldn't
    be a practical way to specify the ligatures in that manner.\r\n\r\nNow, perhaps
    this is an OpenType issue that Flash may or may not have support built in for...that'd
    be a question that one of the OpenType experts would have to address..."

  body: "Flash does not support OpenType advanced typographic features (ligature substitutions)
    at all.\r\n\r\nBasic ligatures (ff fi fl ffi ffl) have their own Unicode entries,
    but less conventional ligatures are either mapped to the PUA or <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/05/eliminate_priva.html\">left
    unencoded</a>.\r\n\r\nIn practice, this means:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Flash can not use
    unencoded glyphs.</li>\r\n<li>It can use PUA-mapped glyphs (I think), but the
    original HTML page would render unreadable without the sIFR intervention.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n--
