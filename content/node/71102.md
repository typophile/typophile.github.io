  looks like Aachen Bold but there are some differences. The 'S' has additional serif
  marks and the 'i' is square versus round.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is just a simple modification,
  but I want to check to see if perhaps there is an alt to Aachen with these character
  sets.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.seeklogo.com/swift-premium-logo-134610.html"

    Extra Bold</a> seems to be almost exact. All you need to do is extend the top
    of the 't'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
