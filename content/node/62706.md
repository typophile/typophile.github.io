  body: "It looks like some of the widths could be evened out a bit. AEHLST look a
    bit narrow. Check your stroke widths too \u2014 the hairlines on F and K are quite
    different weights. The descender on J is quite weak. The spine of S could be more
    smooth and sloped. "

  body: "Thank you Ben, for your feedback.\r\n\r\nI have adressed the widths and altered
    the spine of the S, added some bulk to the tail of the J and made some changes
    to the weights of some diagonal strokes.\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/untitledroman2.pdf|new
    pdf]]\r\n\r\nJust to add; the feeling I'm going for is more classic than contemporary."

    following changes:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>S terminals more like that of C and G</li>\r\n<li>Lightened
    the top of the A</li>\r\n<li>Removed serif from right leg of the R, like on K</li>\r\n<li>Made

  body: The S and G feel unbalanced to me; the top terminals need to be moved slightly
    to the left.  The top terminal of the C might benefit from a tiny leftward nudge,
    too.  The A feels a bit narrow to me, but maybe others would disagree.

  body: "I like it!\r\n\r\nOne small comment: the top of the C and G look like they
    have a flattened region.  Compare with the top of the O and Q which look nicely
    rounded.\r\n"

  body: Thanks! Yes you're right about the C & G, it may have been caused by the adjustments
    of the terminals I did, thank you for pointing it out.

  body: Good work. To me the bowl of the R is too big, too similar to the P. It could
    be a bit smaller, between the B and the P. Also the stem of the U does'nt seems
    vertical and the curve could be a bit wider. Also, I think the A should be wider.
    Keep going.

  body: "G needs more refinement The upper serif isn't flowing nicely from the stem\r\nshould
    it be more like the S. But looking better and better"
