    come up with hard proof of that \"inspiration source\". I for one have trouble
    believing that and think it's a not so kosher copy. That's why I removed the link
    in your post."

  body: Furthermore I once compared the Curtis version with our license of Eclat,
    and the quality is pretty poor.
