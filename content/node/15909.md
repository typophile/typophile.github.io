body: "I found this in a book called \"Early Advertising Art\" by Dover, I was thinking
  of digitizing it for more practice making fonts. But curious on any history of it?
  Has it been already digitized? (didn't see anything close on whatthefont.com). If
  it did make it into a font, i'd most likely give it away.\r\n\r\nthanks"

    likely done by [[manfred klein]]. i''d browse though his stuff and see if he''s
    done it. '

  body: "Can you let us know if you find a digitization of this?\r\n\r\nMaybe someone
    would be willing to do one if it hasn't been done yet?\r\n\r\nHave you checked
    on MyFonts.com to see if Dan Solo made a version yet? He produced many of the
    Dover type books, and have converted a bunch of the images into digital fonts."

  body: "History? I wish I knew. The Solotype Catalog calls this Music Hall Text and
    <a href=\"http://moorstation.org/fontennium/blackheav/fsheav1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>
    you'll find one digital version as Music Hall.\r\n\r\nThe font is copyrighted
    by WSI - one of those companies that produced almost solely clones of existing
    fonts, renamed. However, if you look at <a href=\"Thhttp://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/WSI-FontList.txt\"
    target=\"_blank\">this list of WSI font descriptions</a> by Robert Long of WSI
    (1997), you'll find that almost all of the fonts state that they are \"similar
    in appearance to ...\". Music Hall, however, states that, \"WSI is the first commercial
    collection to produce and offer such a clean digitization ...\". So, just maybe
    this was a rare legitimate WSI digitization.\r\n\r\nThe other digitization I'm
    aware of is Scriptorium's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=rheingold\"
    target=\"_blank\">Rheingold</a>."
