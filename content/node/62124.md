  it might not look futuristic, but it is. This is a early draft version of a geeky
  new font-in-progress.\r\n\r\nThis is what I imagine my future robot's handwriting
  will look like. I imagine a robot would be nice enough to bestow upon me post-it's
  once in a while, so he'll need some kind of handwriting. I'd prefer it look like
  this. Most importantly is it's a monospaced, fixed width font, meaning every character
  has exactly the same width. Makes it easier to type out tables when you don't have
  any tabs available. Geeky and helpful to programmers and robots.\r\n\r\nMore important,
  this is a creative, charming and lively handwritten style that has a blunt quirkiness
  but also a bit of sketchbook free-flowing lilt. This font is dedicated to my friend
  lolife (www.lolife.com) who specifically requested a new monospaced font from me
  years ago. But this font is also for my friend Brian who requested a sarcastic font.
  I was able to kill two custom-font problems with this one font. Ta da!\r\n\r\nI
  wrestled with the monospace problem for years, because I know programmers are frustrated
  by the fact that they only get about 10 good fixed-width fonts to choose from. Earlier
  monospace-font renderings by me were ugly failures, that solved the technical problem
  but looked awful. I trashed 'em and never showed anybody. It wasn't until I mixed
  in the font's \"sarcastic\" feature that I was able to really kick it up a notch
  and make something truly unique and special.\r\n\r\nThere's still a bit of refinement
  to be done, but I'm really proud of how it looks so far. The big acheivement is
  that if you weren't told, you might not even know it's monospace. Just looks like
  some jazzy handwriting.\r\n\r\nHope to get it up at the website, but I thought y'all
  might enjoy a blog entry from me once in a while...\r\n\r\n-chank\r\n\r\n"
