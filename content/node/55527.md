  up quite an image collection. Here is a series of typographic work that I wanted
  to share with you.\r\n\r\nI hope you like them. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MM_staircase_5335.jpg]<!--break-->[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typography_5936.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yazigi1_3747.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yazigi2_6250.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yazigi3_3942.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Yazigi4_5244.jpg]\r\n\r\nWe
  are currently working on a similar project in my Graphic Design II class: incorporating
  text into two New Orleans photographs (one audio, one visual). I will post my project
  when we have completed them."

  body: I love how people do this...I know I did my ekphrasis on the computer but
    I'd love to try doing one by hand like these one day

  body: I agree. This artist is really amazing. All of the detail that goes into these
    looks beautiful and I could imagine that it was a painstaking task. The hand done
    aspect is what makes it so amazing. I'm sure that I wouldn't be as impressed with
    this if it was done on the computer.

    These are really intricate.
