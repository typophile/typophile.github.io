body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kriterion_5573.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  for the font used in the Movie Theater Logo Kriterion \r\nhttp://www.kriterion.nl/\r\n\r\nMy
  guess is it's customized?\r\nI tried under the keyword 'art deco' on several font
  vendors websites,\r\nhowever I couldn't find it, so I thought there's only one solution,
  consult the experts ;^) \r\n\r\nSo thank you all in advance! D.\r\n\r\n"
