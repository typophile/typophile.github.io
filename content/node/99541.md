  you can see the overlapping sections are visible but this only happens on some characters,
  this didn't happen on Fontlab, everything renders correctly there.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: Thanks Frode, I've thought about that too, tried using an action to set the
    contour direction to PostScript on the whole font but the problem seems to persist,
    am I missing something? How can I check the direction of each glyph to make sure
    they're all on the same boat?

  body: "Something weird is also happening, when I change the values of the tracking
    manually on the software (in this case, Illustrator), let's say, changing the
    'O' tracking from 0 to -1, making the 'M' move, the overlap problem is gone, even
    if I change the tracking back to 0 again.\r\n\r\nBut if I delete the text and
    type it again with the default tracking the overlap renders visible."

  body: "While overlaps should be avoided within a single glyph, two separate glyphs
    overlapping shouldn't cause an issue like this. But if there are any overlaps
    within the affected glyphs, make sure to remove them before generating.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>How
    can I check the direction of each glyph</blockquote>\r\nIn the FontLab's Preferences
    under <code>Glyph Window > Outline drawing</code>, make sure <code>Show contour
    direction</code> is checked. A small blue arrow at the first point of each contour
    indicates path direction."

  body: "Have you tried adding more contrast? Just kidding.\r\n\r\nIn addition to
    turning on the path direction indicators, perhaps also make sure that you're not
    running an automatic path direction action as a last step before exporting the
    OT font. It looks like you have a pretty complex set of outlines, and I've seen
    rare cases where FontLab gets the path direction wrong. Admittedly, this is usually
    (always?) before removing overlaps, but it wouldn't hurt to manually check it
    and then make sure it stays that way."

  body: If changing the tracking and then reversing the change fixes the problem,
    that suggests it is an application issue. Does the problem appear when you print?

  body: "Nope, when printed everything was fine indeed.\r\n\r\nEventually I fixed
    this issue by copying the glyphs from Fontlab to Illustrator, deleting the original
    ones and pasting them again from Illustrator to Fontlab, it's weird but it fixed
    the problem."
