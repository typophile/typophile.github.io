  country identity within type, and will be focusing on french typography. I want
  to show that different countries do have an identity with type and show that a country
  can be reflected with type. \r\n\r\ni think its hoopefully going to be about 6000-8000
  words long. \r\n\r\ni am finding resources quite scarce though and was wondering
  if anyone knows of any good books i should check out aimed at this general topic,
  any articles in magazines... ANYTHING that would help me to write a good research
  paper on french typography and identity. \r\n\r\ni have just got back from paris!.
  i took myself there so that i could get a good look first hand and french typography,
  but yea i do understand that the rest of france might be quite different but yea
  i got a taste for it at least!. \r\n\r\nanyways so any help would be much appreciated
  ok CHEERS!\r\nfrom\r\nMark"

    <em>History of Graphic Design,</em> he discusses \"the New Advertising\"--but
    not the old. \r\nRight away we see that the ads in question must be \"creative\"
    to be considered worthy of history.\r\nAre the majority of ads, which are \"non-creative\"
    not more typically American?\r\nFor instance, as is de rigueur, mention is made
    of the famous award-winning Helmut Krone VW ads, which have come to typify American
    print advertising of the 1960s.\r\nBut consider that those were one-page black
    and white ads, and far more representative of the era, statistically, would be
    the double-page, full-colour, car-porn spreads from GM, Chrysler, Ford, and AMC.
    \r\nOf course, both kinds of advertising were American, but don't you think that
    ignoring the mainstream paints a misleading picture? Surely Detroit=America, not
    Volkswagen!\r\nIf you go with material from the books Mark, you will be discussing
    country identity in pre-defined terms, i.e. by what those authors have chosen.
    \r\n\r\nFor comparison, how would you write a history of Hollywood movies?\r\nWould
    the films you discuss be taken from a list of Oscar winners?\r\nFrom a list of
    Golden Globe winners?\r\nFrom a list of the top-grossing movies of each year?\r\nOr
    the most watched movies, taking into account TV re-runs?\r\nOr the most written-about

    agree. At the risk of stating the obvious, <em>any</em> history, research paper,
    etc., is going to be subjective, because its author has to make choices about
    what to show and what to leave out, among other things. And then there is the
    author's stance, the paper's thesis, etc. (I'm saying such obvious things that
    it hurts. Sorry.)\r\n\r\n<em>Right away we see that the ads in question must be
    \u201Ccreative\u201D to be considered worthy of history.</em>\r\n\r\nOr, perhaps
    it's just that Krone's ads broke away from what was typical. That's what I was
    taught, at least. They are in the history books because they focused on the VW's
    supposed disadvantage (smallness) rather than an advantage -- unheard of back
    then! And because they represented a major shift in how things were done (think
    of that scene in <em>Helvetica</em> where Michael Bierut compares the 1950s and
    1960s ads in \"Life\" magazine). But I see your point, Nick: the other ads were
    representative of American advertising, too -- up until then.\r\n\r\n<em>If you
    go with material from the books Mark, you will be discussing country identity

    the 1960s. Design history focuses on the atypical, the award-winning stuff that
    appeals to the art directors and graphic designers who buy design history books.

    Martin L\u2019Allier surveyed the top corporations (listed by net worth) in Quebec
    and determined what their corporate typefaces were. I believe that was a student
    thesis. The same approach could be applied to advertising or periodical design.

    earlier comment, I do see your point now, Nick.  :-)\r\n\r\n<em>Design history
    focuses on the atypical, the award-winning stuff that appeals to the art directors
    and graphic designers who buy design history books.</em>\r\n\r\nBut doesn't a
    history of anything -- civilization, say -- have to focus on the outstanding stuff
    -- the events, people and inventions that moved things forward? (Just finished
    reading Gombrich's <em>A Little History of the World</em> -- so that particular
    history has been on my mind.)\r\n\r\nAnd you make it sound like the only kind
    of art director and graphic designer who would buy a design history book is blinded
    by \"the award-winning stuff.\" Some designers buy design history books to learn
    what came before, ya know.  :-)\r\n\r\n<em>What best represents national identity:
    the mainstream of design as it exists in the mass media, or the minority tastes
    of the design community?</em>\r\n\r\nI think it's more complicated than that...
    For instance, look at what Gerald said: \"One could certainly say that the history
    of the development of typography certainly had nationalistic tendencies right
    up to about mid-twentieth century.\" So you also have to take historical changes
    into account.\r\n\r\nYou would probably need to tackle this question from many
    angles to get an ample view of the [insert country name here] identity in type."

    yup i have to admit i always forget to check them!! so will be making sure i do
    that...\r\n\r\nidentity to me is an interesting subject, and typography as they
    are closely linked in my mind as each typeface has its own identity, and gives
    off its own feelings to people, which is why i chose to do this dissertation.
    as far as people go and identity i have always found it interesting how predictable
    groups of people can be, and how they follow trends to try and be normal, then
    you get groups of radicals, that say they want to be different and how the \"normals\"
    ridicule them for being different, when really the \"radicals\" are not soo different,
    as they are amongst a group of there own too, but just view themselves in a different
    light. \r\n\r\ncountries and cultures in the past have been ever soo different
    as communication, was not so good, but what with native people becoming less and
    less, and people moving all around the world over the last few hundred years (in
    a major way), identities are becoming merged, people are taking on other countries
    ways of thinking. The western world is becoming a popular lifestyle choice. Things
    in some ways, from a diverse style point of view, seem to be merging. well thats
    how i see things in my mind anyways. \r\n\r\nnow from a typographical point of
    view i think i will talk about the whole modern type and try and see if there
    is any information out there, about what people think style holds for future typefaces,
    what with the whole Eu seemingly trying to become one, will this mean the \"brand\"
    of Eu, and cross over of styles, means that a national identity for a said country
    will be lost... these are just all my own thoughts i figured i would write how
    my mind thinks on the topic, its not an introduction to the essey or anything
    just be blabbling.. haha madness!! ahhh\r\n\r\ni need to do a lot more research
    to clearly understand what take im going for in the essey, so yea i will be doing
    a lot more research,, this stage of finding me resources before i start really
    looking at stuff has prooved really great though... and yea much appreciate everyones

    say contentious because local type designers have been annoyed, and some have
    campaigned against, the use of foreign types in their countries to the detriment
    of local creatives. I don't think this so much of an issue now, what with the
    spread of independent foundries to so many countries, and the international market

    I'm afraid.\r\n\r\nI am french, and I think that you can't seriously link type
    with national identity. In all these years, cultures always interpenetrated each
    other, and economical aspects also contributed in the fast propagation of specific
    styles - Didot and Walbaum making copies of the super successful Bodoni for example,
    thus bringing a very italian style in France and Germany. If you show a Bodoni-like
    typeface to some french guy now, He'll say it looks very french. and He will be
    right: Didot, Bodoni and Walbaum have been extensively used over here, thanks
    to Balzac, Voltaire, Knapp or Appeloig. Show it to some american ladies and they
    will recognize it as extremely north american, thanks to the logo of Harper's
    Bazaar. The Roman inspired Trajan reminds instantly of Hollywood Blockbusters
    today. The use or overuse of a typeface contributes to its unconscious gegraphical
    identity, not its actual point of origin on earth. Thanks to Apple, Garamond looks
    american when condensed, though it can also be considered very french. Frakturs
    always look somewhat german, until you show them to some Harvard or Cambridge
    student. And today's types, especially modern humanistic lineales, are just, thanks
    to Internet, completely \"apatrides\": they belong to the whole planet. Of course
    come typefaces just seem to stick to a specific country, like Mistral... But these
    are really very few.\r\n\r\nYou are lucky I am not in the jury when you show off

    of particular interest to me. (I'm currently assembling an <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/36998\">exhibition
    on national identity and modern type design</a>.) From my perspective, a typeface
    isn't necessarily \"French\" because it was designed in France or by somebody
    with French ancestry, or used more than others in France - I'm more interested
    in why types have been associated with France in historical discussions. To put
    it in a different (and perhaps only more confusing) way, I'm interested in \"French\"
    types, not French types. (So I guess I'd defend a link of type design and national
    identity, but by pointing to what David R just called \"its unconscious geographical
    identity, not its actual point of origin on earth.\")\r\n\r\nI believe that what
    needs to be recognized is that national identity is a cultural construction -
    but is no less real or important for that. I think this is the way identity works.
    I might liken it to discussions of race: as I understand it, \"race\" doesn't
    really exist, genetically speaking, and yet it would be hard to say \"race doesn't
    matter\" socially.\r\n\r\nAnother example: when I moved to the Twin Cities, I
    looked for housing in both western Minneapolis and eastern St. Paul (separated
    by the Mississippi). While I was househunting, locals seemed to always ask in
    which city my search was happening - as if it would be weird to look in both,
    rather than \"declaring my allegiance\" to becoming a Minneapolitan or a St. Paulite
    first. This struck me as ridiculous at first - could it really make a difference
    whether I was on one side of the river or not? - but I have come to realize that
    the fiction of difference between the two cities, because it is held by a good
    number of residents, actually does shape the culture of each. It isn't an \"objective\"
    difference, but there is a cultural difference.\r\n\r\nOh, and this\r\n<em>Writers
    and speakers who embrace both the existence, provisionality and provenance of

    I think you are letting the idea of severing our ideas from myth become too absolute.
    I think that the complete avoidance of engagement Myth or perhaps better put 'story

    and theory come from. Insights can be pounded into a theory which can be pounded
    on with evidence. But plain data without interpretation is essentially unusable.
    \r\n\r\nBut all this discussion of intellectual frameworks may not be the deal
    way of pushing foreward on it's own. Maybe it would be better to suggest a model
    of study that you would like to see done. \r\n\r\nFor instance I would be semi-interested
    to know what fonts feel 'french' and by what degree to people broken out by font,
    and by specific city/region and in multiple countries with lots of datapoints.
    Likewise it would be interesting to take discreet features of a single typeface
    say serifs maybe and see if they are seen as more or less 'french' in association
    as the feature changes. I suspect that what would be chased in both cases is a
    false phatasm. But... Sorry these are just examples and don't reflect a serious

  body: "Sorry guys for joining this discussion so late, but I am heavily stuck in
    this topic. I am the guy Florian Hardwig introduced and I spent quite some time
    on such a french topic. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the very first thing is to seperate
    form from usage. What I found out was, that there is a pretty distinctive french
    way of contributing certain roles or functions to different sorts of letterforms
    (Caps, minuscules, scripts). It is rather the uage (connected to cultural ideas
    of beauty and appropriateness) than the shapes of the letters that makes the french
    twist in daily life signage. And that's the very important next point: please
    consider the difference between type as lead typography and lettering. In my opinon,
    the national identity thing rather relates to lettering than to type in the narrower
    sense. \r\n\r\nI disagree with the statistical approach though. The fonts most
    used in Germany today are Times New Roman, Arial and Comic Sans. I would make
    a bet that you'd get similar results for northern America, France and, say, Andorra.
    What does this tell about national identity ? Nothing. Would you choose these
    to design something, say, andorrian ? No. \r\n\r\nTake a look on french packaging
    of the 19th century and compare it to contemporary products. You will find consistencies
    and differences in layout principles, ornament and lettering and you will find
    that some sorts of products are closer to the graphical tradition than others.
    Wine bottles will want to refer to it, medical products won't. \r\n\r\nThe best-selling
    charts of contemporary foundries won't give you a clue either, as these are extremely
    influenced by the 500 biggest enterprises of Europe and the USA who will for the
    biggest part have adopted a sans serif type that is \"neat\", \"clean\" and \"neutral\"
    in a way not to refer to a specific country. Most of them will have a mid-tone
    or dark blue somewhere in their corporate design...\r\n\r\nThe question, wether
    culture is a construct (myth) or not seems meaningless to me as it is real in
    a way that people like to believe in it and by education make sure that this believing
    is transported from one generation to the next. Never the less it is possible
    to accept and appreciate culture and still regard it with some sort of scientific,
    cool distance. Humanities is a discipline of discussing and rediscussing constructs
    over the centuries without ever coming to the point of having a clear, reliable
    result. It tells as much about us than about our ancestry and future generations
    will enjoy to get a picture of us when they will read what we thought about, let's
    say Andorra in the 17th century. \r\n\r\nIt was already mentioned before, and
    I agree that the nationality of specific designers is less important. I think
    what is important is to find out who were their teachers, what school of spirit
    the adhered to and what general spirit ruled the period they worked in. French
    designers arround Maximilien Vox thought of Helvetica gestaltung as a major threat
    for the french graphic culture. German designers of the same 50s/60s period thought
    of it as liberation from the nationalistic and mystical traps Germans had been
    running into. The same typeface has a very different meaning. By the way: the
    swiss school was very influential in post-war France too, so you will always have
    to consider wether the designer was on the \"swiss\" side or the \"french\" side.\r\n\r\nThis
    whole subject is far to big to be handled in an online forum. It's great to have
    it going, I enjoy reading all the different opinions. Maybe there should be a
    congress on that soon ! \r\n\r\n"

    in Germany today are Times New Roman, Arial and Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nHow can you
    know what is most used without measuring usage?<cite>\r\n\r\nIt is a pre-installed
    default on 90% of the world\u2019s personal computers. It is ubiquitous in my
    daily life. I see it everywhere, every day. Of course I did not measure it. Why
    should I spend my time in measuring what is obvious ? -- I don't want to convince
    anybody. But I feel that it is more interesting to read and learn about cultural
    concepts as  those on typographic beauty or beauty in general than to count endless
    examples. The quantity-analysis seems difficult to me also because there is no
    statistically reliable data from the past centuries. Do you measure cultural and
    social values ? How do you ? Is culture about quantity or quality ? Do I need
    to know how many of my compatriots wash their hands after using toilet to think
    about the cultural technique of hygiene ? Or to quantify how many men sit down
    on toilet to think about the social virtue of politeness in the relatonship between
    genders ? For sure it would be great and maybe stunning too, to have data on this.
    But I don't really need it to reflect sentences like this one:\r\n\r\n\u201CSimple
    was its noble architecture; / Every ornament fixed at its place / Seemed to have
    been put there by necessity\u200A: / Art hid behind the looks of nature, / The
    satisfied eye embraced its structure, / Never surprised and always enchanted.\"\r\n\r\n\xAB\u2009Simple
    en \xE9tait la noble architecture\u2009; / Chaque ornement \xE0 sa place arr\xEAt\xE9
    / Y semblait mis par la n\xE9cessit\xE9\u2009: / L\u2019art se cachait sous l\u2019air
    de la nature, / L\u2019\u0153il satisfait embrassait sa structure, / Jamais surpris
    et toujours enchant\xE9.\u2009\xBB\r\n[Voltaire\u200A: Temple du Go\xFBt, 1733]

    are circulation figures for the most-read magazines and newspapers.\r\nCopies
    of these publications survive.\r\nTherefore it is possible to determine which
    were the most-read typefaces in editorial and advertising use, for text and display.\r\n\r\nMy
    discontent with design history stems from collecting such publications. I look
    at, for instance, the popular magazines of the 1920s, and what I see is nothing
    like what's in the history books.\r\n\r\nI can imagine a similar situation arising
    concerning today, if design historians of the future continue to base their elitist
    narratives on \"quality\" (award-winning work) rather than \"quantity.\" The pre-installed,
    ubiquitous faces you mention, Times, Arial, Comic Sans, will vanish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I am misstaken. IN any event, at the risk of butchering what he said ( Sorry JFP!

    almost tastes like camembert! Then there's their unique style of OS numerals.
    Fuzzy? Of course. Entirely subjective? Escapist claptrap.\r\n\r\nAlso, Ladislas

    of cultural reference: a font with an large (nominally anti-French) x-height can
    still have other features that make it French*; and a font with a small x-height
    can still have not many other things that make it French.\r\n\r\n* Like being
    olive-shaped, as Erik S might quip.\r\n\r\nThe important thing to remember is
    that we're dealing with fuzzy push-and-pull impressions (that furthermore vary
    over time and among people) not some clear-cut features that put a design on either
    side of some threshold of being French or not.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I'll let you now what I think in a year. I think I am interested in some French
    style for my Reading face. Practically speaking I have no idea yet what that might
    mean. Just a poetic vibe in my soul. I think some french funk may be especially
    tasty with CALTs in text. The main reason I think this is that "French types"
    ( sometimes made by Frenchfolk abroad in the Netherlands... ) seem to have a bit
    more odd stylist & idiosyncratic features. That could be bunk of course but it's
    the sense I have today. Feel free to correct that idea if you think it needs it.

    I once borrowed it from the UCLA library, and copied the best parts of it; in
    fact Eben I have a whole fat folder labeled \"French\"! Another thing along these
