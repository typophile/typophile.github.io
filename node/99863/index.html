  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of articles on kerning and I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about type designers and their meticulous ways.</p>
<p>I was wondering,
If these are the same (type of ) anal people who come up with the built in kerning info / pairs, why do we still need manual kerning?</p>
<p>Is this mainly personal taste?</p>
</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Each pair can only be defined once for an assumed average context, which really only does the basic minimum for you, and is fine for body text. But now let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re designing a logotype or book cover. The overall context of any specific setting can change how letters ought to be kerned so that the whole word looks consistently spaced. If your design calls for really tight letterspacing, every letter may best be kerned from scratch.</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;ve done a bold logotype for a company called INNERHIM. Nice straight sides you can shove together like books on a shelf, and the extra space made by the R&rsquo;s tail is acceptable because it falls at a semantic division (You would probably go for an overlap if the same RH were in, say, MINIRHINO). Now the company says it wants the same look but its name has been changed to OVERLACKY. Can you at least leave ER the way it was? No, because there is so much necessary space between all the other letters, ER will look too cramped if it is not loosened to match. This is an extreme example for the sake of explanation, but smaller decisions of a similar kind have to be made all the time.</p>

However, the style of (headline) kerning which requires least deliberation is “Tight But Not Touching”.</p>

<p>@Cor: <em>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a good / easy starting point then and take it from there using tracking to loosen things up if you&rsquo;re not looking for tight?</em></p>
<p>Not necessarily, because it’s a totally different spacing system, for headlines—as opposed to Tracy’s method, which is for body text and book faces.</p>
<p>However, I have used the method you suggested, for instance in Figgins Sans:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Smooth_4737.png]
Here, I applied positive kerning to round-round combinations to get the effect, which doesn’t appear to detract from body text settings.</p>
<p>Quark XPress enables editing of tracking according to size, and also custom kerning of fonts. However, it does not enable varying kerning according to size.</p>

<p>Kerning from scratch&hellip;
I always stay uncertain when doing this, never know when to stop or where to rely on. I get stuck comparing spaces over and over making futile changes even when it looks pretty decent.
At the moment I use the character spacing rule of thumb as described in &lsquo;Letters of credit&rsquo; but I guess I&rsquo;m looking for THE method / system.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>Lately I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot of articles on kerning and I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot about <strong>type designers</strong> and their meticulous ways.</cite></p>
<p>By the way, if you go back to the Dark Ages &ndash; before, say, 1992, programmatic kerning was done by compositors. For years, Linotype gave as one of their reasons for sticking with the 18-unit em for kerning &amp; I believe tracking values was their customers wouldn&rsquo;t want to change their kerning programs. Their customers, of course, were all typesetting shops. As if we couldn&rsquo;t multiply by 3&hellip; (Yup, the new em was a 54-unit em. Don&rsquo;t remember the year - late 1970s? &ndash; Nick Shinn would probably know.)</p>
<p>To this day, except for Matthew Carter&rsquo;s fonts, if a font&rsquo;s primary use in our shop  is to be for setting text, the first thing I do is throw out the foundry kerning. Matthew&rsquo;s kerning is almost always to my taste, just not quite extensive enough, esp. with punctuation.</p>
<p>There is a point to this nostalgia. There is pretty much no way a type designer can get all the needed kerning, and absolutely no way they can accommodate all legitimate differences of taste on &ldquo;proper&rdquo; kerning. Don&rsquo;t blame them if things aren&rsquo;t to your taste.</p>
<p>Typesetters are not people who only know what the &ldquo;place&rdquo; command is, and can fill out paragraph styles. They have other responsibilities. In the end, proper kerning is the user&rsquo;s job.</p>

They&rsquo;re about equally [in]frequent: Ypres and Yqem (AFAIK the most frequent words exhibiting those pairs) are both relatively obscure Western European localities. The former is losing relevance as WWI history becomes more boring; the latter is gaining relevance as wine becomes more interesting. My Mana series of <em>bitmap</em> fonts has both those kerned. I average ~8 kerns per glyph, all hand-made - no kerning classes (most recently for a reputable medium-sized foundry that paid me handsomely). Caveat: I have yet to deal with very large charsets.</p>
<p>What makes you think I consider Adobe fonts the ne plus ultra of spacing (or anything else)? But they&rsquo;re still <em>so</em> much better than 99% of the open/free/libre stuff. Because somebody paid somebody good money. AND Adobe allows modification, so precious to you and me.</p>
