  not entirely sure what to expect, but I'm hoping some of you might be able to help.
  \r\n\r\nI'm trying to find a nice and genuine feeling handwritten font to use for
  a project. Nothing too scripty nor too scrawly \u2013 just human, natural and legible.\r\n\r\nI'm
  attaching the best example I've seen. (Please see Viktor & Rolf packaging box) Is
  this a font? \u2013 or do I have to go old-school and resort to my own handwriting
  endevours \u2013 please say it ain't so.\r\n\r\nFirst one gets a prize!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nM"

    some commercial, some good and lots bad.\r\n\r\nThe handwriting in the sample
    you've attached is just that - handwriting, not a font. Personally I prefer not
    to use handwriting-style type as I believe the result will never be as idiosyncratic,
    authentic or satisfying as using your own. However, I appreciate that that's not
    always possible or convenient. My recommendation is that if you CAN use your own
    hand, DO. Failing that, here's a point towards some interesting handwritten fonts.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sparkytype/panhandler/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typefetish/reverend-jim/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/mayfield/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/federico/\r\n\r\nHave
    a look through the Handwritten section on DaFont as well.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=603\r\n\r\n-NJ"

  body: "Thanks NJ,\r\n\r\nYou're right and I totally agree, but facing the prospect
    of writing and scanning 50+ testimonials leads me down the horrible handwritten
    font path. Thanks for the suggestions \u2013 I've actually gone through most of
    the listing on MyFonts \u2013 there are thousands!\r\n\r\nThis was my best find...\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/dear+joe+4/fonts/\r\n"
