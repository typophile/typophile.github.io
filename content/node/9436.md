  body: L., there are probably quite a few fonts that could be considered &#34;variations
    of Papyrus,&#34; unfortunately... could you possibly post a sample of what you&#39;re
    trying to identify?

  body: Papyrus has alternate Initials which are larger. Are you sure that is not
    what you have seen?

  body: Linda, The only other variation of Papyrus-like font is one by Rick Mueller
    called Parchment. You can find it <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/mueller/g_q.htm"
    target="_blank">here</a>. I cannot say for sure if it is the same as what you
    want, but I recall it was not identical to Papyrus.
