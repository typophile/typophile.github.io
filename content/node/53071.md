    U of Minnesota Press, 2008\r\n\r\nIf the topic is not cited by one of the authors
    in this collection, contact Carrie Noland directly as I imagine she would be interested
    in this specifically.  See her work on Georges Bataille's writing about the choreography
    of the cave paintings in Lascaux, France."
