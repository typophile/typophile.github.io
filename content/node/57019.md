body: "When I type (copy/paste) same text in CorelDraw (x4), Illustrator (CS4) and
  MS Word (2007) in font I created in FontLab, every program shows me different kerning.\r\n\r\n-
  Illustrator shows everything alright... kerning and leading, it's like in FL.\r\n-
  CorelDraw shows unlogical kerning... space between glyphs are more wider then in
  FL or Illustrator. Some glyphs are overlapping too...\r\n- Word shows no text, just
  glyph for \".notdef\" for every letter typed!\r\n\r\nI've read [[http://typophile.com/node/15458|this
  topic]], and I've tried to add autohinting to font just to see will it make any
  difference, but everything remained the same. \r\n\r\nAny suggestion/solution?\r\n\r\n"
