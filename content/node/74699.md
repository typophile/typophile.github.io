  typography 1 course; one of our assignments is to find print examples of typefaces
  from a list composed by my instructor. I've found nearly all of them (14/18) but
  I'm having trouble finding these last 4. I just  bought the latest editions of In
  Style, Details, Cosmopolitan, and Glamour to try and find adverts with these typefaces
  but I'm not really having any luck training my eye up. I've spent the last two days
  combing through newspaper adverts, yellow pages adverts, and these magazines and
  it hasn't jumped out at me. So here are the typefaces I'm looking for:\r\n\r\nOptima\r\nDIN\r\nTimes
  New Roman\r\nBembo\r\n\r\nand I could do with a better example of Eurostile but
  it isn't necessary... Thanks to anyone that could help me out."

    for type faces might be wired magazine... Its like a Designers bible and they
    often experiment with such type faces. "

  body: "Thanks oldnick, I need to try and find print copies of everything. I'm going
    to call the LA Times and ask what typeface they use in their newspaper, but sadly
    I don't think it's Times New Roman because the serifs on the capital S are on
    an a bit more of an axis than they should be.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I've got an older issue
    of Wired sitting upstairs that I'll pour through. I'm at my grandfather's so the
    house is full of print media from the 50's and 60's. "

  body: "I'll contact them about receiving some information, thanks! Still no sight
    of Optima, though I think I've found DIN in Glamour, which I must have overlooked.
    Times New Roman is so common yet so obscure to find. \r\n\r\nThanks for everyone's
    input! Let me know anyone knows of any other companies that use that. Or perhaps
    even Caslon."

  body: A good way of recognizing Bembo is to look for the caps A and R. The A has
    quite a thick crossbar and the leg of the R sticks out a fair bit.

    for example the PDF of an editorial available from [[http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jgm/journal/v7/n1/abs/jgm200943a.html|here]]
