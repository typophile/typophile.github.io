This time it&rsquo;s a logo for myself. I&rsquo;m starting a small web design business to earn extra money for school.</p>
<p>The logo will accompany a new design for <a href="http://www.gurrydesign.com" title="Gurry Design">my website</a> which I want to have a gardening theme. The idea is that I can help people &ldquo;grow&rdquo; their business with a well-designed website (sounds korny, I know, but it should be good when it all comes together).</p>
<p>So here are my two variations of the logo.<!--break--> Your thoughts and comments are much appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think that you may be treating the logo a little to litteral a manner here. You probably shouldn&rsquo;t be creating some frankenstein hybrid of a kind of platonic ideas/icons of &lsquo;business&rsquo; &amp; of &lsquo;growth&rsquo;. Like a tendril making a dollar sign&hellip; god forbid. That might be okay for a spot illustration in some ham handed business journal- but not a logo.</p>
<p>The purpose of your logo aught to be to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Be Different</strong> I know I sound like an advert but it&rsquo;s true all the same. I1f your doesn&rsquo;t do this - especially as a designer - a basic tentpole is missing. Who are you competing with? Look at them &amp; be different. Being yourself may well be enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be memorable.</strong> This is different than being Different. Really. This is the graphic equivalent of a catchy song hook. You want something that you look at &amp; you find yourself looking again. It&rsquo;s not a trick - it&rsquo;s a behaivior of the eye you want &amp; then of the brain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be yourself.</strong> This is tricky &amp; very subjective. You want to have a logo that you don&rsquo;t feel is false, a fake or feels like a sham. For instance, if you were a small neiborhood florist you might not want a chilly multinational corprate style logo. You would want something warmer, friendlier, and maybe more classic classy or fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be fast.</strong> A logo that takes too long to communicate or be understood is a deadly logo.  This is one of the reasons that a hybrid is out. It takes too long to understand &amp; an impatient eye moves on. If the logo doesn&rsquo;t do it&rsquo;s basic job in the short time it takes to glance at it- it&rsquo;s not that great. I&rsquo;m not saying it should be a pleasure too look at for longer - just that it needs communicate it&rsquo;s basic message <strong>very</strong> quickly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t key that an idea as such is imbeded in a logo. Especially for a service industry. Look at the most successful logos - Mercedes, Apple, DKNY - pick your own. You won&rsquo;t find an idea in almost any really successful logo. You will find they evoke a feeling in you. That feeling is enough. And a treatment of Type is often enough to create that feeling.</p>
<p>In terms of process I would make a list of words or phrases that describe the kind of assumptions that you want your logo to create in a viewer. Take stock of your target.
Make sure it&rsquo;s the target you really want.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Peter, asking a web design business to grow business might be a little of an over promise, unless you are tied into marketing people and writers. I think the best you can do is offer website design as a tool to help grow a business. Even then you&rsquo;d need statistics showing growth and percentages vs other kinds of sales promotion and marketing. I think I&rsquo;d approach your web design business differently, something along the lines of &ldquo;personal touch&rdquo; or &ldquo;one on one&rdquo; design. Imply your designs aren&rsquo;t cookie cutters but solve a businesses particular problem. Just some thoughts</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dan, that is a good point and I was thinking myself that to say my web designs can grow a business is a bit too ambitious. Although, I do offer eBay template design which really can contribute directly to more sales. That service is one I want to feature much more prominently with my new design. In any case, I really do want to set myself apart from other web design businesses by being personable. Being a one man show gives me some advantages over the competition, particularly that I can give more attention to my clients. That&rsquo;s something I do want to highlight on my new site and even in my logo. Perhaps it would be best to go for a wordmark rather than using some kind of symbol. What do you guys think?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It seems like a prudent way to go.</p>
<p>And the wordmark&rsquo;s style can be such that it&rsquo;s clear that it isn&rsquo;t a rubber stamp sort of operation. What flavor of anti-generic are you? Caligraphy or Hnadwritting might be one way to go. Personal &amp; unique each time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If I go the way of the wordmark it really is key that it stand out from the crowd. I&rsquo;m thinking something friendly and personal yet still professional. Possibly a script, though a stylized sans-serif could work as well. One other requirement: it has to be cheap as this is all to <em>earn</em> money for school. Suggestions?</p>
<p>Here are some I like:
<a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000147">Chocolate</a>: though too expensive.
<a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000141">Bello</a>: still too expensive.
<a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000143">Koziupack</a>: Similar to Chocolate above, and maybe a bit too fancy

		<div class="commentbody">You could also take an font you have &amp; alter the letterforms. That&rsquo;s how the microsoft logo was made. It&rsquo;s a franklin gothic modified &amp; with a bit cut out. That would be cheap. You could also work on a job &amp; use some of the funds from that for the font later&hellip;. Having a logo in no way guarantees work. And taking your time wioth an identity is usually a good idea if you can swing it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Peter check out Font Diner. Last year Oscar Meyer used a Font Diner font for their summer campaign. Their fonts are display fonts and inexpensive. I think you could take one and modify it like Eben has suggested and you&rsquo;d have a winner.</div>
