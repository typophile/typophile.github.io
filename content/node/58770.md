body: "The attached draft is based on a 1957 poster for \"Invasion of the Saucer Men.\"
  \ Please check it out and give me your feedback!  This is the first vintage remake
  (and full typeface for that matter) that I've undertaken and I know it could use
  some tweeking, but would love feedback at this early stage, both overall and also
  any specifics.  \r\n\r\nHere's a link to the original poster: http://www.idave.com/INVASIONSAUCER.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your comments!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Start by making similar characters consistent (not identical, just consistent).
    Look at the counters (negative spaces): <strong>G</strong> has a much wider counter
    than <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>B</strong> has much wider counters than <strong>D</strong>.
    The counters in <strong>Y</strong>, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>U</strong>, and
    <strong>V</strong> are all different widths. The bottom counters on <strong>K</strong>,
    <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>X</strong> all have rounded tops, but the bottom
    counter on <strong>A</strong> is flat on top. <strong>H</strong> looks like it's
    from a different alphabet because the vertical strokes are so thin and the counters
    are so wide.  \r\nLowercase <strong>m</strong> and <strong>n</strong> are rounded,
    but lowercase <strong>h</strong> isn't. The descender on <strong>g</strong> is
    completely different from that on <strong>y</strong>. \r\nAssemble these characters
    into some words and phrases. If you make the word <strong>CHOOSE</strong>, you'll
    see the problem with <strong>H</strong> right away, and when you compare <strong>C</strong>
    and <strong>O</strong>, you'll get a start on making your stroke weights consistent. "

  body: Though still unpolished, this is a significant improvement over your first
    version. The spine of your cap "S" needs to be smoothed out and made parallel.
    That's the most obvious tweak I can see need for. I'll let the more articulate
    folks help with the rest.
