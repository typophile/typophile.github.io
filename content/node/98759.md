body: "Can anyone recommend good serif and sans serif text faces to use with Felix
  Titling?\r\n\r\nThis is an identity project for an historical society & museum.
  It looks like Felix Titling will be used at display in the mark. I have tried to
  find a similar face that would work at both display and text sizes-- I've looked
  at  H&FJ Requiem and  also Throhand, but their serifs are too fussy at display size.
  I've also looked at Bembo, but the caps are too heavy at display size.\r\n\r\nI'll
  also need a sans serif, and am looking at H&FJ Verlag--I think this will work well
  but am open to other suggestions.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"

    all versions are free, a generous donation is recommended: Pablo's gotta eat,

    donated $50.00 to Pablo because I thought his effort was worth at least that much,
