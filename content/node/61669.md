  my personal identity as well as my website + portfolio.\r\n\r\nFor the past 2 years
  I've been using Vista Sans (Alternate + Regular) as the typeface for my identity
  and promotion materials, and although I still quite like it, I would like to see
  if you guys have any suggestions in terms of similar typefaces to Vista that I could
  possibly use.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind: I'm looking for something that's presentable
  in both print and web mediums.\r\n\r\nAny/all suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot for your help!\r\n\r\n-Ayda"

    it doesn't seem to make sense to switch to something <em>similar</em>. If you're
    switching, it's typically better to switch to something completely different.
    What do you want your font to convey about your firm?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hi Hrant,\r\n\r\nI agree with your comment in reference to switching to something
    different, although my intension is to first see what else is out there (that
    I might not be aware of)\r\nI may or may not make a switch, but I do think it
    is good to scope out some other options.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what the font should
    convey about my work I'd like something that says \"modern, elegant, simple, clean,
    smart\" with a subtle touch of femininity.\r\n\r\nOn that same note, if you visit
    my website you'll see that I have a somewhat feminine logomark, which is the most
    prominent part of my identity. So, the typeface should mainly accommodate this
    mark both on my website and the stationery materials that carry it.\r\n\r\nHope
    this explains what I'm looking for a bit better..\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have
    any thoughts/feedback!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n.A"

    to switch? Can you describe what it is about Vista that you're not quite happy
    with? \r\nThat should make it easier to suggest alternatives.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"&lsquo;modern,
    elegant, simple, clean, smart' with a subtle touch of femininity\"</cite>\r\nYou

    to stick to your current choice or take a closer look at Helvetica, Arial, Lucida
    Grande and Geneva. By choosing one of these websafe fonts you will definitely
    be out of deep waters.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to have a serif font I'd suggest Georgia
    or Times.\r\n\r\n"

    need to replace the Vista Sans...however if you want something more feminine/elegant,
    I would go with what Altaira suggested, its perfect for what youre looking for.\r\n\r\nTake
    a look at <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brevia/\">Brevia</a>
    or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typonine/tempera-rose-pro/\">Tempera
    Rose Pro</a> too.\r\n\r\nYou can also checkout Informa, Alber, Effra and Ronnia.\r\n\r\nJeo."

  body: "Ayda, although your logo has some feminine traits (it's \"wispy\", and\r\nmysterious)
    it also has some masculine ones (symmetry, rigidity of line).\r\nSo the first
    thing that popped into my mind was Kursivschrift:\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/samples/linotype/KursivschriftStehend.gif\r\n\r\nI
    like some of Jonathan's suggestions too (although I couldn't find Effra).\r\n\r\nBTW,
    concerning what Stefan said, of course for any text on your site that\r\nis actual
    text, you should choose a font that matches your identity. But\r\nusing a web
    font for all parts of your identity is unnecessarily restrictive.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
