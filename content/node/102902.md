body: I've just released my first paid font family via MyFonts, and I'm having trouble
  getting the word out about it. What's the best way to approach this? Send images
  to blogs? I posted it in the release section here and didn't get much feedback,
  any ideas?

    body: Yep, that's the one. Is the secret to marketing fonts letting others do
      it for you?

  body: "Will. To be perfectly honest, I think your typeface is horrible. That is,
    some of the effects are very nice, but it seems to me it\u2019s <em>all</em> effect
    and <em>nada</em> substance. I can\u2019t believe you are actually selling this!
    Or, actually: I have no doubt you <em>can</em> sell it (you know, people are horses),
    but how on earth you are going to <em>live with yourself</em> afterwards beats
    me.\r\n\r\nLooking at your website, I was thoroughly impressed by your reimagination
    of the InDesign font menu. You\u2019ve clearly been thinking a lot about how it
    could be improved. Why not devote the same attention to your type design? Read
    stuff! Study the masters! Don\u2019t churn out whatever. Do the best you possibly
    can, and spend the years it takes to get there. Anything else is just a waste
    of time.\r\n\r\n(Maybe I\u2019m just misunderstanding a faux na\xEFve thing \u2026)"

  body: "To be a bit more specific: Your letters lack (some) basic optical corrections
    (like for example thinning of joints), but appears to have others (like overshot).
    Your curves are poorly drawn (look at transitions from straight line to curve;
    uneven edges where they should be smooth) and especially your circular shapes
    suffer. Most internal shapes appears to follow the external shapes closely (or
    vice versa) which makes me believe you started with a skeleton and applied a stroke,
    leading to problems like the strongly ellipse shaped counter in \u2018o\u2019
    (this needs to be more squarish) and a sagging right edge of \u2018n\u2019 etc.
    And then there\u2019s \u2018s\u2019, with thinning, a fairly good spine \u2014
    the odd one out. The letters themselves are poorly balanced, and the spacing is
    uneven and I don\u2019t understand the point in providing a bold when it is so
    close in weight to the regular. \r\n\r\nEven after that long tirade, there\u2019s
    still nothing in here that is particularly exciting or new. It seems to be a common
    misconception that making something \u201Cneutral\u201D is easy. On the contrary.\r\n"

    cool feature, so that can be played up. Some of the imagery reminds me nicely
    of Native American art.\r\n\r\nSee this thread and all its links: http://typophile.com/node/96694\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    still a lot of work to be done, and I'm constantly tweaking these fonts.

  body: "Will, I seldom post here \u2014 I'm still a beginner, so I mostly read what
    others more advanced have to share \u2014 but your last reply that says \"I know
    there's still a lot of work to be done, and I'm constantly tweaking these fonts\"
    makes me wonder what's in some peoples' head (and also how young and immature
    are you):\r\n\r\nYes, fonts have a version number, like software programs, so
    they can be updated with small corrections (correctly aligning a misaligned diacritical
    mark, for example, 'cause everybody makes small mistakes), but what do you mean
    \"constantly tweaking these fonts\"?!? Like \"the shape of the letters of the
    fonts I already put on sale on MyFonts.com will change with time, when I get more
    professional with this font design thing\"?   I can't believe some people think
    like that!\r\n\r\n(Also\u2026 what Frode said 110%)."

  body: It would also be more beneficial for the users if you were to cover a complete
    Euro-Latin character set (at least). For instance, a polish user can do next to
    nothing with this typeface. A restriction to the basic Western repertoire seems
    fairly outdated, i.m.h.o.
