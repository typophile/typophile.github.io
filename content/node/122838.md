body: "Hi\r\nI adjusted the mark positioning lookup for my Arabic opentype font in
  VOLT. The shipped font works correctly in most applications in Mac, PC and ioS8
  . However I discovered a case where problems occur:  When exporting from Word 2013
  to PDF the  vertical mark positions are not adjusted at all, and they stay in their
  default positions. This does not occur in a font like Arial, as seen to the bottom
  of the illustration.\r\nAny suggestions to solve this welcome\r\nvladimir"

  body: Good idea thanks! One expects every software to obey the OT features... but
    we have to accept some cases like this I guess. Even the best software, like InDesign
    changes the harakat positions where it pleases.
