  body: This is a hand-painted destination "roll" sign. These were used on buses and
    subways. Very cool. A few options are [[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/refrigeratordeluxe.html|Refrigerator]],
    [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/AgencyFB|Agency]] or [[http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/solanogothic/pk_solanogothic.htm|Solano
