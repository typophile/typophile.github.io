body: "I'm reading John Irving's novel, <i>Last Night in Twisted River</i> and enjoying
  it quite a bit. The Canadian cover is beautiful, thanks largely to the photo by
  Irving's son, Everett Iriving.\r\n\r\nThe type appears to be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/sackers-light-classic-roman/sackers-light-classic-roman/|Sackers
  Light Classic Roman]]. And the thing that my eye keeps going to is the space after
  the R in \"IRVING\" \u2013 is it kerned oddly? Is that because of the metrics that
  Monotype assigned, or did a designer kern it that way for a good reason? I keep
  staring at it, trying to see the rationale.\r\n\r\nPerhaps folks here, many of whom
  have extensive knowledge of kerning, would like to comment?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/twisted_5900.jpg]"

    way. It must be the \u201Cwarm tones elicit warm responses\u201D phenomenon. Or
    maybe it\u2019s the typography.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tr_4771.jpg]"

  body: "It definitely draws the eye. Fonts are rarely that badly kerned and I can't
    imagine anyone doing that on purpose. \r\n\r\nKerning all caps presents many challenges
    and especially with a font that has such variation in widths. If I had the font,
    I'd love to re-kern this and see what could be done to improve the kerning throughout.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a very evocative design. Too bad about the type."

  body: "Interesting how different the covers feel even though the central motif is
    the same. \r\nI'm curious, how warm/cold is the novel, or: which cover matches
    its tone better?\r\n\r\nAnd while I don't think I count as having \xABextensive
    knowledge\xBB of kerning: Yes that \"RV\" combination does not look very good.
    I don't have the font so can't comment if that's the original kerning\u2026 but
    I'd have brought them closer together. BTW the kerning in the title looks uh,
    suboptimal to my eyes too, or maybe I should say T W IS T ED. :-\\\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"or
    it's a reference to the \"river\" in the title.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nHa!"

    some playing around in Photoshop and it's an improvement, but that is a bear of
    a kerning assignment. You fix one combination and it affects the look of another.
    I'd definitely recommend another font.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nina, to answer your question about the temperature of the novel: several
    seasons are covered in the course of the book \u2013 several decades, in fact.
    I haven't finished reading the book, but two pivotal moments have already taken
    place in icy conditions, so I can see why the snowy landscape is appropriate.
    The warmer, antique look fits too, though.\r\n\r\nI have read that Irving takes
    great interest in the design of his books. His was apparently disturbed that as
    the writer, his input was not so greatly valued when it came to Hollywood adaptations
    of his works. He has had to struggle to have his say in the movie business. Actually,
    he wrote a [[http://www.john-irving.com/My_Movie_Business.asp|book about that.]]\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the issues of \"suboptimal\" kerning on a Canadian version of his latest novel
    were not vetted by the author. On the paperback edition, maybe."

    Jane. It is an interesting challenge with lots of wrong answers. I'm not happy
    with a lot of the combos. \r\n\r\n<em>\"Thanks for going to the trouble of wrestling

    from the work I *should* be doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
