  thread, I'm new here!\r\n\r\nDoes anybody believe that a direct connection can be
  made between graffiti (as opposed to street art) and typography and letter design.
  If so are there any examples that would demonstrate this description.\r\n\r\nI'm
  an ex-graffiti writer (many moons ago) who, after beginning my graphic design degree,
  began to recognise that what I always looked for in what I thought to be 'good'
  graffiti, whether that be with the hastily written 'tags' or full blown murals tied
  in with the principles of type design ie spacing, x-heights, stroke thickness, ligatures
  etc.\r\n\r\nGraffiti has evolved to become more abstract and technical over the
  years and I am aware there are artists that do choose to use letterforms in the
  more, I suppose, traditional sense. Likewise, I believe that there are type designers
  like Seb Lester that take some cues from graffiti. If you disagree, I'd love to
  hear why.\r\n\r\nI'm in the final year of my degree and have decided to base my
  Self Elected Research project on this topic. Through online searches I've come across
  this book http://parallelstrokes.com/ which focuses on the subject but I'd also
  be interested in any other resources there may be out there. \r\n\r\nAny help/nudges/shoves
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTriston."
