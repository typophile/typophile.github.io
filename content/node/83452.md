  body: Off the top of my head, I can recall seeing this treatment in the Book of
    Kells, so it isn't an Art-Deco-only phenomenon. As far as a good name for it,
    the title of your post seems to cover it...

  body: "@Nick Shinn: thanks!\r\n\r\n@Nick Curtis: Ah, that would explain why I always
    thought this style looked kind of runic. I think this picture probably shows the
    one you refer to. http://jonsullivan.com/images/ireland/it-kells-bg.jpg So maybe
    it's possible that this treatment was brought into popularity in the late 1800
    \u2013 early 1900's through the arts&crafts movement, inspired from a celtic tradition?"

    both moved down from the top <em>and</em> moved up from the bottom, so completely
    avoids pointy joins \u2013 sort of like a H with a tilted crossbar. The one from
    Korinna shown above can then be seen as a hybrid between that shape and the more
    usual one where the diagonal is, in fact, a diagonal, forming an apex and a vertex.\r\nSo
    much for observation. I'd like to learn more about the background of these forms,
    too."

  body: "It's more likely that the elongated aesthetic of art nouveau was interpreted
    in lettering as \"high-waisted\", and that this form of N harmonized with the
    look of capitals that have raised middle crossbars.\r\n\r\nAlso, in ultra-condensed
    low-contrast styles, squeezing in a long diagonal crossbar is extremely problematic,
    so the higher join lessens the angle, and the problem. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/led-zeppelin_3882.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhen
    designing Beaufort, I found that this effect enabled me to keep the angle of the
    diagonal consistent across weights. Also, it provided a bit of interest to that
    bottom right joint in the heavier weights, to match the interest provided by the
    sharp point, descending below the baseline, in the lighter weights. A normal blunt
    join would have been too dull, and a less-than-stem-width flat terminal would
    have been an anomaly. And, also, it counterbalances the \"overshoot\" of the diagonal
    at the top left.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AN_3426.png]\r\n\r\nIMO,
    individual glyph shapes in original type designs are most often functional interpretations
    of the thematic vocabulary, concerning harmonies of shape and proportion, that
    characterize typefaces, and not primarily references to specific glyph forms associated
    with historical precedent\u2014although previous themes <em>in toto</em> may inform
    the new typeface."

  body: "sorry for the late answer, I was away a couple of days...\r\n\r\nNick, it
    seems like you summed it up pretty well. The the raised diagonal certainly works
    better in condensed design, as they fx were quite popular in the late 18 \u2013
    early 1900's and this is definitely a more plausible reason for its appearance
    than a purely stylistic inspiration.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!\r\n\r\n"
