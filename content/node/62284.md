body: "Hello fine typofolks,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a wordmark for author Leif Enger.
  It's a clean, slender sans with an Urnes style ligature to hint at the client's
  Scandinavian ancestry. I'm shooting for 'dignified and literary.' The main applications
  will be standard business card, letterhead, etc. \r\n\r\nThe forms were build from
  scratch, and I've been staring at them a bit too long; I'd love any advice on weight,
  balance, kerning, or anything other thoughts.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'll likely be developing
  a version for web use, and I'd be grateful for any pointers to keep the lines crisp
  at web sizes. Thanks all!\r\n\r\n\r\n- Reed"

    that "g-e" looks quite nice. With one little caveat: The white "gaps" (where the
    strokes cross) are very thin, and I''d worry they get lost at business card sizes.
    If you need them, they might need to be a bit wider.'

  body: I think the ligature would be better if the stroke would appear first over
    then under the other strokes (or viceversa).
