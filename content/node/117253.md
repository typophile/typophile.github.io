  body: "Thanks very much Don.\r\n\r\nAh that is the date of the data on the map,
    but it was issued during WW2 - I'm a historian, not that bad on dates thankfully.
    After cropping the Reichsadler I can see why that might be a bit misleading, apologies.\r\n\r\nI
    wasn't sure if the typeface was from the WW2 reissue or the original version (I
    don't have a copy of the original to hand), hence why the request was labelled
    as \"WW2\" - again, thanks for your help. "

  body: "No problem. As for the italic, the digitized R\xF6misch Stehend family has
    \ merely a sloped Roman, as R\xF6misch Liegend.  The _g_ in your map is the most
    noticiable difference at this scale. You could edit R\xF6misch Liegend or use
    another high contrast italic.\r\n Don"
