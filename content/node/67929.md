  Estereo. A few notes:\r\n\r\n1) It's meant to be quirky, hence the odd pairing of
  mostly heavy strokes with the occasional light ones.\r\n\r\n2) There won't be a
  lowercase set. Lowercase glyph positions will be reserved for a number of uppercase
  alternates and ornaments.\r\n\r\n3) I'm looking for critiques in particular with
  respect to stroke weight across characters; for instance, it's pretty safe to say
  that the A and the X are not of the same weight and need to be fixed.\r\n\r\n4)
  I don't think the S is quite finished yet.\r\n\r\nAny additional feedback before
  I move forward would be excellent. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/amv_estereo_preview_0_4884.png]"

    rest looks rather a lot like Futura Extra Black. I''m not sure it''s going to
    make a consistent mix until you have more of the former.'

  body: "Looks great with the tight spacing in the title.\r\n\r\nThe ink trap in the
    top of the N really stood out in a bad way, then I noticed all the other ink traps.\r\nI
    don't think this face would be used in a small enough setting to need such big
    ones, and stylistically I would say they are not really adding to the face. At
    least fix the N.\r\n\r\nMaybe square up the W a bit. I say that because doing
    \ would make tight setting easier, which I think is good for this face.\r\nThough
    I would have to see the W in use now to really be sure."
