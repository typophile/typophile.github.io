    genre of letterforms, but the serifs don't match either of those. I feel like
    I've seen this on a newspaper somewhere, but I'm not sure. Where is the sample
    from?"

  body: "OK, so I've found that it is indeed P\xFAblico, a quality Portugese daily,
    which launched its redesign on february 12th. Mark Porter, Art Director of The
    Guardian, was in charge of the redesign, following the model of the British paper.
    My guess is that it's a custom designed font, either by [[Christian Schwartz]]
    who did the <a href=\"http://christianschwartz.com/guardian.shtml\">The Guardian
    faces</a> which were also inspired by [[Gerard Unger]]'s work, or by Gerard himself."

  body: And <a href="http://www.christianschwartz.com/">here it is</a> on the home
    page of Christian Schwartz's website. That's why it looked familiar -- I saw Stockholm
    during his presentation at ATypI, and Christian showed it to me again when I was
    writing up a short piece about the The Guardian redesign. Scroll down to halfway
    my <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=91">ATypI Lisbon Day Three

  body: "Kiko, thanks for the nice things you said about our typeface for Publico.\r\n\r\nThere
    are a couple of things I want to clarify here:\r\n\r\n<cite>My guess is that it's
    a custom designed font, either by Christian Schwartz who did the The Guardian
    faces which were also inspired by Gerard Unger's work, or by Gerard himself.</cite>\r\n\r\nPaul
    Barnes and I designed all of the Guardian faces together (Publico, too), and I
    don't deserve sole credit.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say we were 'inspired by Gerard Unger's
    work'. These days, that term is usually interpreted as referring to a revival,
    i.e. the way Fenway was 'inspired' by Fleischman's work. We were certainly influenced
    by contemporary Dutch type design, and Gerard's work is an important part of that,
    but we were also influenced by 19th century English Egyptians, Mark's love of
    Renaissance italics, and the headline face the great Willi Fleckhaus used in <cite>Twen</cite>.
    Did you doze off during our lecture, Yves?"

  body: "Whoops, \"inspired by\" was indeed very unfortunate wording and not correct
    at all. What I meant to say is that one could see the similarities between Gerard
    Unger's style and Publico, which are both rooted in the contemporary Dutch type
    design indeed. And I apologise for forgetting to mention Paul's name (second time
    I irked Paul -- this will look <em>not</em> good on my resume). :^/\r\n\r\n> <em>Did
    you doze off during our lecture, Yves?</em>\r\n\r\nHardly, as you must've figured
    out from my review, but it <em>is</em> nine months ago, innit? ;^)"
