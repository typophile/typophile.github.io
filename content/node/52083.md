  body: "Hannes, are Meta, Scala and Thesis really translation-based? \r\n\r\nFor
    Meta at least, I would have said expansion-based. Humanist is often used with
    sans serifs to indicate there is modulation in the strokes, but historically humanist
    is associated with translation, and expansion with neoclassicism and romanticism.
    Among sans serifs, I think only Today is truly based on translation, and Legato,
    though not based on translation, but a clever derivative of expansion, is a low
    contrast serifless face that approaches the condition of translation.\r\n\r\nThe
    sans serif version of Scala has to be a derivative of the serif version, which
    came first. The serif version is, to me at least, a post-modern derivative of
    the expansion-based egyptiennes, with a nod in some places to the stroke modulation
    characteristic of translation. I use post-modern here in Robert Bringhurst's sense,
    as elaborated in 7.2.11 of the original edition of <em>The Elements of Typographical
    Style</em>.\r\n\r\nA word of caution though. Hrant has said he thinks my analysis
    of Legato is hopelessly contorted. He might think this of my analysis of Scala
    as well."

  body: "Quay Sans was released in 1990, five years after Meta was designed and three
    years after the story of its making was published in Baseline magazine. We used
    Meta for our design studio (whence the name) a few years before it was released
    as a FontFont in 1991.  It wasn\u2019t the first time David Quay was \u201Dinspired\u201D
    by another typeface \u2013 ask Neville Brody. \r\n\r\nThen again, we are all influenced
    by what happens around us. I designed Meta because we could not find anything
    that was suitable for setting forms and other printed material for the German
    Post Office (Bundespost). I analyzed 10 faces, among them News Gothic because
    it was narrow, Helvetica because it was a standard, Syntax because it was a fresh
    alternative to all the boring geometric sans faces, and Letter Gothic because
    it had solved issues of surviving on bad paper with bad printing. That is where
    the bent-out top strokes come from. I had not understood Noordzijs theories of
    expansion or translation and I didn\u2019t know what a humanist sans was either.
    I simply looked at the problem in hand and drew some letters that had squarish
    counters to create contrast, robust and open shapes, was about 12 percent narrower
    than Helvetica, had narrow caps (German uses a lot of them) and used little devices
    to avoid filling in at small sizes on bad paper.\r\n\r\nI feel that Meta is quite
    warm. That is partly due to the fact that there are lots of details which add
    noise at small sizes and that Meta was designed over a period of time, with many
    designers adding bits of the family after I designed the first two weights in
    1985. It is actually quite messy, which some people call charming. Thesis, on
    the other hand, is 110 percent perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    whom should I seek out for therapy? Certainly not dyspeptic Brooklynites. They
    can never find anything good to say about anybody. Maybe Mario Feliciano, the
    sunny Portuguese and wonderful type designer. Yeah, next conference I'll try to
    find him and see if he can cure me :) \r\n\r\nOn the issue of the value of the
    Noordzij style analysis of the 'stroke'. Personally, I take this very seriously
    :)  I do find it very helpful when designing to think how I am modifying the stroke
    in relation to what a pen would do. \r\n\r\nStill, I think it is of limited use
    in understanding the design of faces beginning in the 19th century, and especially
    now. Erik says his constraints were his brief of a font useful for the post office,
    and his looking a ten different fonts--for different reasons. The solution incorporated
    elements from these other fonts, plus his own idea about more square, open counters.
    So the bent stem didn't come from a pen stroke, but rather from another font.
    Admittedly it is conceivable that that other font may have been inspired by Goudy,
    who spent the first part of his career lettering. But still the most of his considerations
    about width,  weights, shapes and proportions had more to do with the brief and
    his ideas about what would work, rather than what a pen would do or not do. \r\n\r\nIn
    other words, most of the story is not about the stroke, but other things.  "
