body: Hi, a tutor of mine has introduced this site to the class and I have decided
  to join, because i think this will be the place where ill get help and critiques
  for my work. At the moment I'm half way through my 3 year degree graphic design
  course based in New Zealand, and one day I hope i'll be designing some sort of typefaces.
