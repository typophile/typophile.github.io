    you deactivate it deletes the copy/link.</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is only partly true.
    When modern font managers like Suitcase activate a font on Windows, they do so
    programmatically by modifying one of two different registry keys depending on
    the font type. If you look at C:\\Windows\\Fonts\\ it will appear as though the
    directory contains shortcuts. This is the way Microsoft has chosen to represent
    the Windows font system. The fonts folder, though, is not a normal directory.
    The only way files can be added to it are though the Add Fonts dialog. So, the
    \"shortcuts\" are really created by Windows to represent the state of the font
    system, which is reasonable. After a font is added, other API calls are made to
    update the system and tell Windows to refresh the font menus of open applications.
    \r\n\r\nThis has varied somewhat over time as well. My understanding is that Suitcase
    9.x did in fact do something similar to creating a shortcut. Suitcase 11 (Windows)
    does use the method I've described however.\r\n\r\nOn the Mac OS X side, there
    has always been a robust programming interface for font activation. As far as
    I know, nothing like a shortcut has ever been used."

    may be considered bad grammar in the States -- I wouldn't know -- but it's fine
    over here! I've never had anyone pull me up on apostrophe use before: it's one

    in the States too. There's a difference in meaning (verb aspect, in this case)
    between the \"preterite\" (completed action) and the \"present perfect\" (something
    occurring in past that continues or relates to present) that works mostly the
    same, so far as I know, in both American and British standards of English. In
    this case, the latter verb form is useful to imply that the toaster still does
    not work."
