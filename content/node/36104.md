  am currently looking at several design schools and their graphic / communication
  design departments.\r\n\r\nOne school in particular will end up costing $80,000.
  Most of which will need to be covered by loans. At 34 years of age, this potential
  burden causes me anxiety, even though I'd love to attend this school and know the
  school's reputation will help open doors.\r\n\r\nI think what was missing in the
  previous forum was an answer to the question: Does a design school education and
  the job opportunities available in graphic design warrant being in debt for many
  many years?\r\n\r\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

    field. You'll learn much more that way, even tho you'll probably have to work
    your way up to being a designer.\r\n\r\nMy experience has been that most of my
    design colleagues have not had design school degrees. I've never really seen the
    point."

    what I can tell there are a lot more design school graduates than there are good
    design jobs in desirable locations, so no. As Patty said, one does not need a
    design degree to become a designer. You can also take plenty of design classes
    as a continuing education student and get some sort of certification for a lot
    less than the cost of attending design school."

    the door is a solid portfolio of work. If you're young, then school is an obvious
    way to go about getting that.\r\n\r\nBut it really depends on what particular
    areas of design you want to focus on and pursue jobs in."

    salaries start (I think...) at around $35,000 or so and most of them top out well
    below a hundred grand, even with 10-20 yrs experience. So do you really want to
    go into that kind of debt? Where's the pay-off? Ain't exactly law school, and
    you don't need to be certified in order to practice.\r\n\r\nCheck out AIGA's salary
    survey for your area to get more accurate figures than I listed above."

    been an agency art director for 25 years and was downsized into oblivion. No work
    for 3 years. That's the end of the line.

    production artists, graphic designers and art directors. Really the only 2 things
    I thought about were, the Book, and the Personality. I think if your book is very
    convincing, and you're not a wienie, you'll do ok\u2014with or without design
    school.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't have learned enough to get my first design/AD jobs without
    getting through the Vis Comm program at the Alberta College of Art and Design
    though. Just remember, there's a big difference between learning TOOLS, and learning
    aesthetics and the principles behind using design to communicate. Sometimes the
    only way to that superb portfolio is the long way. Learning and doing. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    you shouldn't try to rely on this schools' rep to get you hired. Maybe THAT's
    not worth it. "

  body: To me, it was worth it. To my career, not as much. In design school, I trained
    and aimed to be great. Now that I'm working, being "good" is enough (and preferred).
    Then again I wouldn't even be close to good if it weren't for school.

  body: Look around. For $80,000 you could probably buy a partnership with someone
    in their mid 50s. Work with that person for the next 10 years and sop up what
    he/she has to learn, and then take over the business when he/she retires. (Just
    make sure you are getting into a good place, and not just a hack shop.)

    is a unique one, and one I hadn't even considered.\r\n\r\nArt Center in Pasadena
    is the school I have been thinking of attending. I've taken quite a few of their
    Art Center at Night classes, and have grown exponentially. I love the school,
    but I just feel like the cost would never pencil out in the long run.\r\n\r\nI'm
    more inclined to return to North Carolina and apply to NC State's design program
    for a 2nd bachelor's degree. Much cheaper and the student and faculty work looks
    up to par with what I've seen at Art Center (except for Art Center's Trans / Product
    design and Illustration folks, they are really awesome)."

    years. And schools that have accelerated study for more "experienced" newcomers
    entering the field are also quite often strong, in my opinion. I went to art/design
    school when I was 17, so I can''t advise out of personal experience. But over
    the years, I''ve been at three design schools, graduated from one, and about to
    start in a fourth program in the UK. I like design education, I guess you could
    say. '
