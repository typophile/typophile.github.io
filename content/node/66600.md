body: "Greetings,\r\nWould really appreciate your sage advice and tyopgraphical wisdom.\r\n\r\nWorking
  on a magazine redesign using Christian Schwartz' delicious Brunel (see samples below),
  which he describes as an anthology of the late eighteenth and nineteenth century
  English foundries.\r\n\r\nI need to find the perfect sans to pair ... something
  that evokes the same era and feels like part of the family with that lovely period
  flavor. I'd also like to find a compatible slab ... so basically the whole works.\r\n\r\nWhat
  would YOU match up? And if you have the time ... please tell me why. \r\n\r\nMany,
  many thanks!\r\n\r\nBrunel:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brunel_spec_6728.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BrunelDisplayDeckText_5297.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BrunelTextWandP_3765.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BrunelDisplayWoTW_5583.gif]"

    Sans</a> is based on the birth of the sans, though it's a very personal interpretation.

    of the English modern serif style.\r\n\r\nI'm impressed by the Victorian eclecticism
    of Jeremy's Trilogy types, but the sans doesn't fit the period and construction."

  body: 'Given the strong contrast between thicks and thins in this face, I would
    have been inclined to suggest a face from that period which also had such a contrast.
    Not Radiant, as that is from the wrong period, but something along that line:
    for example, Globe Gothic.'
