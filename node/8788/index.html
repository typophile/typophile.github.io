		<div class="commentbody">Since you said that you do not have a business, and that this is for &#39;personal correspondence&#39;, it sounds like you want something formal. Perhaps that&#39;s what you mean when you say &#39;professional&#39;? <BR> <BR>You still have an almost unlimited selection, because you could use formal scripts, serif fonts or sans serif fonts. <BR> <BR>I would expect that the place that will be making your stationery will have many styles that they can recommend, and if this is truly &#39;engraving&#39; they may not have many conventional &#40;digital&#41; fonts that we can recommend. <BR> <BR>Ultimately, since this is being used to represent YOU, it should be your decision about which style represents you best. You will also be able to avoid the issue about licensing if you just use the typefaces your stationery printer has in his collection. <BR> <BR>If you still want ideas, though, I am sure people here can tell you what they see a lot for this kind of stationery.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Karl, if you are going to have stationery engraved, I suggest you get in touch with the engraver you plan to use.  <BR> <BR>During my college days I use to work for an engraving shop and fonts were limited. But the salesperson always tried to find a font that fit the personality of the client. It was one of the reasons the shop was one of the top three in Manhattan, back in engraving days - not an easy feat. <BR> <BR>Make sure it is a font you are comfortable with and helps express yourself. True engraving was something you lived with - was very expensive, and no room for errors. <BR> <BR>BTW, you could always design your own today, and they have paper plates....</div>
