  and Musee.\r\n\r\nHas anyone used these?  If so, how did you like working with them?
  \ Any specimens you'd like to share?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=NjQz|Capsa]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=MTU2|Musee]]\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: I am a big fan of Musee. It's a modern Plantin in a way. You can test its
    OpenType features <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/dstype/musee_regular/">here</a>.

  body: "Thank you for your responses, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nI guess my actual question
    is: have you used Capsa or Musee in creating something?  And out of anything you
    created, can you share a sample?  A book page, a magazine article, a logo, a headline,
    etc.?\r\n\r\nI want to get a sense of how these typefaces might be used in the
    real world, beyond the mouth-watering PDF specimens already available.\r\n\r\nThank
    you in advance.\r\n\r\nRahim"

  body: Jelmar, this is an off-topic question, but which program are you using to
    manage Capsa? Which format are you using?

    book, whenever you can.  I'm just trying to get a sense of real-world usage like
    yours.  \r\n\r\nAntonio: Yes, I saw the PDF specimen.  But if you see anything
    out there set in Capsa, do share the link.\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance.\r\n\r\nRahim"

  body: "Tiffany: I have not yet purchased it. By managing do you mean a font manager
    or what software I will be using it in? As to formats, I only see an OpenType
    version for sale, if that's what you meant. :)\r\n\r\nRahim: I will most likely
    purchase Capsa very soon, so when I have anything typeset I will see if I can
    show you a couple of pages."
