body: "Hello there, I've just been through a thread here on typophile and saw a post
  from charles_e. The thread is [[http://typophile.com/node/55212|http://typophile.com/node/55212]].
  He got some line counting going on left to his textarea. Anyone got an idea how
  to activate that feature, or is it self made (not an autoation by ID)?\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nTim"

  body: "It's just a text frame on the master page.\r\nWith a numbered list, all you
    have to do is hit Return until the entire text frame is filled. Put the frame
    onto a separate layer, so you can switch it off for a final version.\r\nThe leading
    should, of course, be equal to the plain text leading in the real text frame (I
    think Charles uses Fit to baseline Grid). The side frame will not pick up any
    leading changes in the accompanying frame."

  body: If you set its layer color to white, you won't see those annoying paragraph
    signs or the line numbering frame. --
