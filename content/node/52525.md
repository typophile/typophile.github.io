  body: "Hi Timo.\r\n\r\nSomehow, the lowercase a seems much too off. I think you
    should remove the overshoots for the tail of the lowercase a, and see if it gets
    better. Also, as the typeface gets bolder, the details become much more obscure
    (especially for the lowercase n). These bold types are usually set in large sizes,
    so detail is important, but it's up to you if you made it really that way.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck, and keep it up.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJosef"

    stems (a, d, n, etc.) have filled up because of the boldening.\r\n\r\nAcutually,
    I would open up those spots in all the weights."

  body: Has potential. Very Lineto. I get your attempt to add weight mechanically,
    but the heaviest weight really is distracting, like Jelmar said. I think you can
    still adjust those joins a bit without getting goofy.

    will look like little black blobs at text sizes. But it's your call. :)

    looks thicker than a vertical one, when using the mathematically same thickness.
    \r\n\r\nMaybe it might help if you make the horizontals less thick overall. This

    does not have to register any of their trademarks in order to claim use of them
    as trademarks. I never said \"registered trademark\", or anything about Emigre
    starting litigation proceedings. \"Infringement\" of a trademark needs no formal
    enshrinement to bolster a claim.\r\n\r\n<em>also, dilution as a legal term involves
    famous marks and would have no basis here.</em>\r\n\r\nWanna put money on that?
    I'm not a lawyer but I have worked for a firm of entertainment lawyers who say
    you're wrong about that.\r\n\r\n<em>So maybe out of respect for Emigre and Barnbrook\u2014and

    to change the name of Maison. Ask them first. I didn't bring this up with the
    idea of Emigre wanting to take legal action, only that they may have objections
    and so it would be prudent to either change the name of Maison to something else
    or consult Emigre about it.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "we'll leave the first one alone because <cite>assemble a claim</cite> can
    mean anything. I took it to mean, get litigious with an actual legal filing, whereas
    you probably meant, send a letter.\r\n\r\nI know infringement can occur without
    a registered trademark, but was pointing out that Timo will not face a lawsuit
    until a mark is filed (and a mark can be expedited for a fee) :)\r\n\r\nthe second
    one, it's probably semantics again.\r\n\r\n<cite>dilution</cite> is a nebulous
    term that can mean whatever we want it to mean. \r\n\r\nlegally:\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 is a United States federal law which protects
    famous trademarks from uses that dilute their distinctiveness, even in the absence
    of any likelihood of confusion or competition. It went into effect on January
    16, 1996. This act has been largely supplanted by the Trademark Dilution Revision
    Act of 2006 (TDRA), signed into law on October 6, 2006.</cite>\r\n\r\nalso:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_dilution\r\n\r\nbut
    there are state statutes that don't require a mark to be famous to be diluted.
    But those state statutes are really not germane here, i don't think.\r\n\r\nMost
    IP attorneys in the United States\u2014and this is where I'd be willing to bet!\u2014associate
    the word <cite>dilution</cite> with famous marks.\r\n\r\nI didn't want timo to
    think he was in some kind of predicament... and I wanted to point him toward a
    possible solution. Which is why i posted.\r\n\r\nbeyond that:\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sure
    if we were both sitting in the same room having a chat, and not guessing at intent,
    we'd be on the same page. :D\r\n\r\nand looks like we both support the same conclusion.\r\n\r\ncheers"
