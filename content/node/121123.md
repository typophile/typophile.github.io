  body: "The concave style in _MAY THE BIRD..._ may not have made it into the digital
    era.\r\nThe closest digital for the bottom three quarters could be  Fredericksburg
    NF, an interpretation of the 19th century design called \"Teutonic\" \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FredericksburgNFAsMaySM_5548.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/fredericksburg-wbw/
    The top quarter is a \"wanted poster\" reverse contrast style as shown in many
    \"wild west fonts\" such as Buffalo Western [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BuffaloWesternasMAY_4327.jpg]

  body: "'MAY THE BIRD...': completely new to me this one; a cross-genre French Clarendon/Italienne
    x Tuscan Concave; couldn't find anything similar; best option would be what Don
    said: start with 'Teutonic' (another version [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/teutonic|here]])
    and add large fat top serifs; you could also do it the other way round and starting
    from a Tuscan Concave Slab like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/number-154|Number
    154]] reworking all bottoms;\r\n'LITTLE JIMMY DICKENS': interesting digital alternative
