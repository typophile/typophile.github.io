  The ingredients list is given to me pasted in a word document and properly written
  in arial. Once I copy it and paste it into illustrator the whole text changes. I
  guess it's because it switches it as if it was written from left to right instead
  of right to left. It obviously can't be fixed by flipping it horizontally or reflecting
  it.\r\n\r\nIf you've had this issue before or have any idea of how to solve it I'd
  be really grateful.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!!!"
