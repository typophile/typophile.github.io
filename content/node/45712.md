body: "Hey again,\r\n\r\n\r\nOK I will start with attaching my initial ideas for this
  little record company located in sweden. The first promo releases will be on 7\"
  vinyl. It is electronic music with a soulfull twist .. want it to fell a bit vintage
  etc i think. A bit rockabill/ol blues stuff but with a modern finish cause it is
  still electronic music. So these will in the end be attached on vinyl-labels etc.
  Ok let me know what u guys think.\r\n\r\nCiao!"

    of soul and kind of fill out the word balloon out.

  body: you must treat the typography as you treat the bubble; if you grunge up the
    bubble, you must grunge up the type.  If you want the type crispy clean, make
    the bubble the same way.

  body: "I like the rectangular speech bubble better than the round one.  1, 3, &
    4 are all good directions, IMHO.  Although #1, with the ray bans, may play as
    too ultra-fresh retro, so that it will seem ironic only a year from now.  Apparently,
    according to Details magazine, they're \"out\" already, particularly in different
    colors.  But I digress...\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

    its friendly.\r\nhowever the typography doesn't work with the illustration.\r\ni
    think you should try and rework that so that the type feels like it belongs there."

    give me a hint of the music style you described. Is the bunny full of static electricity?
