    much as I would like to keep that window, it\u2019s a bit too large. But is an
    old building in a historic district, so there\u2019s an off chance the owners/tenants
    will leave it there to keep the preservation weenies happy.\r\n\r\nOh, I checked
    my photos and it\u2019s signed and dated 1991."

  body: Window painting and gold leafing on glass is not a lost art just yet, though
    it is certainly a lot harder to come by in these days of computer-cut vinyl. Since
    they're in a historical district, I doubt the old sign will be preserved, but
    the preservationists may at least require the new business to be marked in a similar
    technique and style.

    the subject of signs, one of the saddest things to me about the demise of hand
    lettering and the rise of computer-generated font/signage is the absolute ugliness
    of current signage in society. Sign painters were so talented and creative, and
    their genius truly beautified shops and public streets. Look at photographs of
    old New York and Paris and small-town America--the signs were gorgeous. Walk up
    and down the street now, and with all our developed technology, modern signage
    is profoundly ugly.\"\r\n\r\ncheck the whole interview there:\r\nhttp://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/the-hand-is-mightier-than-the-font-bernard-maisner\r\n\r\ndr"

    get: why is digital signage so horrible so much of the time? Is it that after
    buying software and printers the shops just can\u2019t afford good type? Or is
    it that when the signpainters went out of business they were replaced by people
    who never had a clue to begin with? I suspect it\u2019s a little of both, combined
    with the \u201Cmake it bigger\u201C mentality of average Joe Businessman."

    but those might have been done in Sign Gold, the gold-plated adhesive vinyl. Since

    that are made out of stuff by hand. At least, in my part of the city. Maybe not
    in the 'burbs and malls.\r\n\r\nAs with so many issues, there are no statistics

  body: Sign painters John Downer and Leonard Otillio, who together did a glass gilding
    workshop a few years ago at TypeCon in Minneapolis, both work out their designs
    digitally. Both make and utilize their own custom fonts for such work. (Some of
    John's commercial fonts started out this way.) The art is output to film to make
    silk screens, which in turn are used to apply the design to glass. Touch up is
    done with a brush.
