body: "It appears to be a modified version of Stratum. However the type also appears
  in other materials as well, not just the logo, which leads me to think a typeface
  exist. It's like Stratum and Serpentine have been merged together.\r\n\r\nHas it
  just been modified or does a typeface exist?"

  body: "Definitely based on Stratum 1 (this /W and those numerals can't lie) and
    massively used on their [[http://realalebrewing.com|website]] with [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Vonness|Vonness]]
    Condensed. I also don't know any \"Stratum-like with flare serifs\" like they
    did. You may like some fonts by Mattox Shuller of [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Fort_Foundry|Fort
    Foundry]] like Industry, Industry Inc. and Gin (some sort of \"condensed Stratum-like
    with latin serifs\") that looks pretty appropriated for such branding identity.\r\nSome
    more but far less close: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/boucherie|Boucherie]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/charcuterie|Charcuterie]]
