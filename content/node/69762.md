body: "I have just taken up letterpress printing and have bought a collection of metal
  founts, some of which are easily identifiable, others less so. I have two blackletter
  founts that have got me stumped.  Images are incuded here - if anyone needs bigger,
  higher quality images of specific character, just ask.\r\n \r\nIf it is of any help,
  I have amongst the type I have just purchased, quite a few that are clearly marked
  from the Stephenson Blake & Co. foundry. There are no marks on the blackletter type
  itself, but there are one or two bits of spacing material with their mark, but I'm
  unsure whether the spacing was originally with the type.\r\n \r\nAny help or advice
  you can give would be very useful. Many thanks in anticipation of your response.\r\n
  \r\nKind regards,\r\n \r\nChristopher Skinner\r\n(Norfolk, England)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blackletter-1_3949.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/blackletter-1-detail_6703.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/blackletter-2_5373.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/blackletter-2-detail_6535.gif]"

    R. H. Stevens and Co., Ltd. generally, but there are a lot of subtle differences.

  body: "Hi fellow letterpress newbie,\r\n\r\nI'd venture this is Festival Text, although
    the specimen I see in the 1977 SB catalogue appears to be slightly different in
    places, but it's difficult to tell from the metal faces alone really."
