  body: I also think that putting the domain in the name is unnecessary. Students
    are internet-saavy and will bookmark (or remember or Google) if they want to return
    to the site.

  body: "Your design resembles that of The Guardian newspaper \u2013 two colors, all
    lowercase, no spaces, similar typefaces (by the same co-designer). First-time
    visitors may have to stop and rescan, involving more context, to understand that
    this is an entirely different, independent product. While this would all happen
    very quickly, it's certainly not desirable.\r\n\r\nSince The Guardian's brand
    awareness is not something you can do anything about, an all new, radically different
    sketch for your masthead might be worth a try."

    We are called guardian, so we should look nothing like the Manchester Guardian

    media, is this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://photos.moniker42.com/photos/i-hMTkZDx/0/S/i-hMTkZDx-S.png\">\r\n\r\nSo

  body: "A bit of a side point (I'll have another draft up tomorrow for the community's
    acute verdict) but... Here's the thing: I don't actually like futura. It's just
    a good G for the purpose. I've tried many ways the last few weeks of using futura
    to match our new logo, but even for headlines and display text it just doesn't
    work.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you have more than one character of futura it starts getting
    muddled. Too full of lines, no prose. Upper case words occasionally have so much
    symmetry that you have to accept and admire the ostentatious clarity, but try
    doing a lowercase URL or a block of text.\r\n\r\nRight, so in conclusion fuck
    futura. i'll post something else as unfutura as it gets tomorrow. End of rant
    :)"

    caps in one color; it's more readable in the black/red versions. \r\n\r\nI like
    that you've dropped \"co.uk\" in some versions."

  body: "What would it look like if you did \"glasgowguardian.co.uk\" all in the same
    font, then just had the \"guardian\" part stand out in red? In all honesty, I'm
    terribly fond of the first masthead, I think it looks nice. I think I would play
    with the kerning a little bit, it seems like \"guardian\" is much tighter than
    the other parts, probably due to the fonts, but it kind of messes with the flow.
    Definitely tighten up the \".co.uk\" part, if anything. Maybe you could play with
    the black, maybe a gray might look nice? I dunno, I'm just throwing out some ideas.\r\n\r\nIn
    general, my feeling about it is that I prefer the lowercase and sans-serif font.
    It just looks more modern--your other designs look good to me, but just not really
    for a student newspaper."

    rest of the font is still probably a bit too close the Guardian website.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer
    - logo design isn't really my speciality but thought you might appreciate some

    the \"I\" problem is a bit concerning, but the white G has to be cropped in on
    the left and right, not the top and bottom. That's our logo. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone
    else see an \"I\" there at the left? If you all do, maybe it's time for a new
    idea..."
