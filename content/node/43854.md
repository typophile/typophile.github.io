  body: "This makes me think of the calligrapher font designers, like Hermann Zapf,
    Gudrun Zapf von Hesse, Arthur Baker, Cynthia Hollandsworth, or Philip Bouwsma,
    but nothing I can find by any of these people seems to match this. \r\n\r\nAre
    you sure that it's a font, and not hand-drawn calligraphy?\r\n\r\n\r\n - Mike

  body: "I actually found it through veer.com I used their flont program and typed
    it in using a font called Lingwood. When I went back to purchase the font the
    y wasn't the same. Although I'm 99% certain this is where I found it a font can't
    just change so now I'm doubting myself and thinking I may have found it somewhere
    else. \r\n "

  body: "It's not Lingwood. None of the characters match if you look at them closely.
    Lingwood doesn't have a point on the top of the cap A, the r has a serif on the
    left side, the u doesn't have that stress on the curve.\r\n "

    the wrong font. Which one did you think it is?
