  this project from a couple years back.  Reworked the logotype and typo in general.
  <BR> <BR>Thought I would solicit some feedback. This is for a screenprinted bottle,
  all black will be matte ink on a jet black glass.  Capsule will be red wax. <BR>
  <BR>This is a high-end napa cab. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance. <BR> <BR> <BR>jpeg

  body: "Hello, <BR> <BR>Very nice, clean, and elegant design. I don&#39;t see anything
    that needs improving, but if I had to throw out suggestions... <BR>I might try
    adding a little more of the red somewhere \u2013 perhaps on the rules that wrap
    around the bottle. <BR>And, hmmm, maybe tighten up the kerning on A/M of Amicus
    a wee bit.  <BR> <BR>Looks great! <BR> <BR>Cheers!"
