<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello everybody <br> <br>i have just started to redesign a logo <br>for a "chateau". The company is very famous <br>in Greece for their hotel in an amazing landscape <br>in Chalkidiki (northern Greece). Wine production <br>is a secondary activity of the company <br>and the "chateau" is placed in the same <br>landscape to the hotel. There is no need <br>to be a connection between the two -i just <br>mention the whole thing for the story. <br> <br>I tried to make the design as clearer i can, <br>though i kept all the basic shapes in the buildings <br>since i don't know how much i can omit. <br> <br>For the moment i prefer A though i am not sure <br>about the sizes (that's why A1 and A2). <br> <br>I am looking forward for comments about <br>the typography and the clarity of the design. <br>I was trying to find a good combination to make <br>a ligature but i couldn't see such a case. <br>If anybody have a suggestion on it i will be <br>very pleased to know. <br> <br>Thanks in advance and have you all a nice day. <br> <br>christos <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39630.gif alt=sign> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39631.gif alt=proposals></div>

<div class=commentbody>I like very much the way that you have used the thinning lines to convey the landscape, but I wonder if the oval shape retained from the original isn't keeping the whole design somewhat rigid. Is that oval shape a requirement from the client? <br> <br>Otherwise, I don't like the versions with the borders around the image as I find that they make the design heavy. If pressed, however, I would prefer the borders in B, C, D and F because they mirror the lines in the image. <br> <br>Generally I prefer the versions without the thin-thick line at the bottom as they are more open and welcoming, although the F and H are fun. My favourite example is G. <br> <br>I hope that these comments are helpful; I look forward to seeing the final decisions for this project.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the logo without an oval border, and I <br>like the KAPPA? (?) with the swash K, like in <br>C,D,E. I also like KTHMA in italics, like in B. <br> <br>But these are the details and I think that you <br>have the core of an excellent mark.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Christos, you have made an excellent mark. Of those that you show here I like A2. No border on the oval and the double rule below the type looks both fresh and modern to my eye but also provides a nice foundation for the type. <br> <br>In general the oval is very active and is eyecatching. I wonder if the buildings could be simplified, removing the window details and providing a calmer centre like the pupil in the iris of an eye. <br> <br>No matter what, your revision of this mark is a huge step forward for the chateau. <br> <br>Jon</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello Christos, <br> <br>Don't get me wrong, I think the oval works as well. I like the play between the curve of the edge of the <br>oval and the various straight lines. Were it bothers me is in how the oval shape isolates the image <br>from the type. <br> <br>Maybe it is just me, but I would put the type aound the oval (like in the original) as that would unify the <br>two, however I didn't want to suggest that when I put up my first post (as I felt that it would not be <br>interesting for you to be too similar to the original) so I wondered about modifying the oval instead. <br> <br>By the way, I like the modifications you made; they have lightened everything up considerably. <br> <br>The Italics in III are to my taste; they go very well with the other elements. <br> <br>Just a question, what kind of applications will this have other than letterhead etc. Will this be on signs, <br>wine bottles, menus? <br> <br>And best of luck to the Greek team today! We will be watching from here (if we can find space <br>in a caf</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello <br> <br>don't worry Robert and of course i didn't get you <br>wrong. I was wondering about the oval after <br>you mentioned it, so i tried different shapes. <br> <br>It was a good coinsidence because now that <br>i opened typophile to send them, i find your post. <br> <br>I think you are right about the type. <br>It works better in the way it is now. <br> <br>The sign will be applied on everything <br>you mentioned and even more... <br> <br>Thanks about the support but Czechs have a great <br>team. I hope we will win, but if not at least <br>the competitor is a worthy one. <br> <br>cheers, christos <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39734.gif alt=new2></div>

<div class=commentbody>Wow, these look great! <br> <br>It occurs to me that by removing the "sky" the image has opened up, which really lets the <br>type into the image. It think that a version with a rounded bottom might embrace more the type <br>on top, but I like these versions too. <br> <br>It's funny, I wasn't partial to the swash caps in the previous versions, but I like them in this <br>latest post. I think that the angles of the swashes are working well with the lines in bottom right of <br>the image. But I find the middle version the most elegant typographicaly. <br> <br>This is really a beautiful project. I'd stay at the chateau if I were in town... <br> <br>Robert</div>

<div class=commentbody>This design has progressed very nicely, terrific job Christos. From your last posting I prefer the logo (in the grouping of five with no type) that is in the middle. It has the sky (?, I thought it was more landscape) and the land on the left breaks out of the rectangle shape. to me, it makes the overall design more interesting and dynamic. As for the type I like the version on the left, with the swash K's. One thing that looks off to me is the swash k next to the cap T and then small caps for hma. I don't read Greek so I'm assuming that is gramitically correct, but how would it look with thma all in small caps?</div>

<div class=commentbody>good morning. <br> <br>Robert and Kirsten i tried your suggestions. <br> <br>Kirsten you are right that the "T" doesn't fit <br>to the "K". Actually i was thinking about that <br>...i just needed someone to say it. <br>I also tighten the kerning and now i think <br>the swashes work better. <br> <br>Robert it seems your wish worked as we won <br>the Czechs yesterday. I have to admit that <br>they really were the best team in Euro 2004 <br>but the psycology was with us (around 15.000 <br>Greeks were at the stadium) and our defence <br>was strong. If i wasn't Greek i would support <br>the Czechs and even that i am pround we passed <br>on the other hand i feel sorry that <br>they didn't make it, because they deserved it. <br> <br>Thanks for the feedback, au revoir <br> <br>christos <br> <br>make it<img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39783.gif alt=new3></div>

<div class=commentbody>You are right Ivan. There is a seashore in the original logo, but i decided to "sacrifice" it for the favor of simplicity (or i didn't find a way to keep it). Of course if the client will insist on it i will have to find a way. <br> <br>...no more words about soccer. Not everybody share this discussion with the same pleasure... <br> <br>christos</div>

<div class=commentbody>Regarding the sea--perhaps the straight lines at the left could be parallel curves? This would gently indicate the shore but not become too important. The 2 sets of straight lines now seem to be attacking a fort. <br>I like the last 2 in "C" best. Perhaps the length of the curved type "Porto Karras" could equal the width of the drawing. The word "KTHMA" could be smaller, lighter, and wide letterspaced to also equal the width of the drawing? <br> <br>ChrisL</div>

<div class=commentbody>chris: i agree that the straight lines are disturbing and that there is a need for more contrast between "KTHMA" and the name. One the other hand i disagree with the need to fix everything in the same width first because i think it will be so over-symmetric for my taste and second the letters will be very small. About the contrast i prefer to keep the lc italics as in B2 and C2 (i think i will keep C2). <br> <br>Good day to all, christos</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Christos, <br> <br>That is lovely. The only thing I notice is the strange perspective change between the two towers. The tall tower looks like it is falling to the right. I think it will need to be flatter on top (showing less of the back wall. Either that, or the tower with the roof may need to show more roof.
