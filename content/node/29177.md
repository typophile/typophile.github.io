body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Type Technologies]] : FFIL</strong>\r\n\r\nThe FFIL
  file is what is traditionally know as a Mac [[font suitcase]]. In OS 9 and before
  it generally had a suitcase icon. In the case of a [[Postscript]] [[Type 1]] font,
  there needs to be a [[LWFN]] paired with it; this is the Postscript Type 1 [[Outline]].\r\n\r\nAnother
  common situation is that the font is a traditional Mac [[TrueType]] font. It has
  the outlines contained in the same file as the Suitcase. There is no obvious way
  to tell using only the Finder. It does not need to have a .dfont or .ttf extension,
  and does indeed store critical data in the resource fork. If you add the font to
  a font manager, you should be able to determine quickly that it is TT.\r\n\r\nIf
  a PostScript font suitcase is missing it\u2019s outline, it may sometimes be refered
  to as \u2018[[bitmap]] only\u2019 or an \u2018orphan\u2019. In some applications,
  these faces may still be available, typically you will get a warning if you try
  to print them. This situation exists for backwards compatability with certain applications. "
