    slanted angles. BTW thanks for the word 'vectorsmith'.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "I was thinking of the practice of drawing curves using the sort of methods
    described here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typies.blogspot.com/2006/11/vector-drawing-mistakes.html\r\n\r\n<cite>If
    you are making a path and using your handles in 90\xBA or 180\xBA (orthogonal),
    make sure where you place the points. A misplaced point generally makes dirty
    curves...</cite>"

  body: Sounds like something a mathematician might say. An 'orthogonal' as something
    that has nothing in common with an argument makes perfect natural sense to maths
    majors. I sometimes catch myself using mathematical terminology figuratively in
    everyday situations, which is sometimes complicated by the fact that mathematicians
    use everyday words like 'normal', 'closed', and 'complex' in specialized meanings.

  body: "And \"orthogonal\" is used in Hilbert space too, so in Quantum Mechanics
    one can say, for example, that a position eigenstate of a particle is orthogonal
    to a momentum eigenstate of a particle (the integral of the product of the two
    wavefunctions is zero), which means that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle applies
    directly in its simplest form to those two observables.\r\n\r\nFrom that usage,
    the figurative usage of \"orthogonal\" to mean independent or unrelated comes
    very naturally.\r\n\r\n"

  body: And of course the familiar Euclidean space, which forms the basis of our geometric
    intuitions, is just a special case of a Hilbert space.

    be 90\xB0 to the surface of the picture (the diagonals in a perspective drawing,
    for example)."
