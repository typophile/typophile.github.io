  it is a custom font and therefore not available for licensing. \r\n\r\nwho can help
  me: which fonts look very similar?\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nulli.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thank you for your answers.\r\nright, \u201Cmiller\u201D is really close.\r\n\r\nbut
    i totally disagree with stephen, corporate occurs very different to me.\r\no.k.
    the line \u201CDIE M\xD6GLICHKEIT\u201D in dstype\u2019s sample looks like it
    could be from a mercedes benz ad but \u201Ckontakt\u201D has a more solid standing
    to me.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I was referring to the light weight, yes. The long serif forms are similar.
