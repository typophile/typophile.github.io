body: "Hi all,\r\nThis was quite a complex project for me, though short. I designed
  an obituary/memorial annoucement for a friend who died recently. \r\n\r\nSomeone
  sent me the piece she had designed in Word, which you see reproduced below (smaller
  than the original 8.5 X 11). She asked me for a better photo. I said: I think I
  better do the whole thing. She quickly agreed to that.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cl-obit-original_5733.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt's
  all in Arial except for the odd brush-like title font. \r\n\r\nHere is my redesigned
  piece:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cl-memorial-6i_5076.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  display font is \"Serena,\" which I bought a while ago, but never had the occasion
  to use. It seems to work. What do you think? \r\n\r\nI decided on colors to harmonize
  with the photo: green and brown. \r\n\r\nI struggled with the text font. It has
  to display well both onscreen and print, cause this is being sent out as an e-invitation
  to the wake/memorial.\r\n\r\nOf the sans text fonts, none had the dignified, elegant
  look I wanted, even Optima.\r\n\r\nOf the serif text fonts, of course I wanted something
  more elegant than Times or Georgia. I tried ACaslon, AGaramond, AJenson - none looked
  very clear onscreen. The slab serif fonts were more clear, but did not harmonize
  with Serena at all. I ended up using Warnock Pro. This comes with Adobe products,
  but I've never used it before. To my surprise it was clear onscreen (at full doc
  size), maybe because of the strong wedge-like serifs. \r\n\r\nI revised the copy
  as well.\r\n\r\nFeedback please?\r\n\r\n"

    but one should not embellish death, and so I would recommend Caslon (or other
    font with small caps and numerals) or similar to use instead of your proposial.\r\n\r\nIn
    effect, I would suggest using just one typeface."

    That worked well for the burial of my grangfather.

  body: "Keeping it simple is always good advice. I'd introduce some more white space
    as well. You also have a bit of dissonance in that it's a mostly centered composition,
    but then the title is cramped into the top and made into a split-level. \r\n\r\nAnd
    sorry for the loss of your friend. "

    mean the line is placed too high? Or delete the line \"In Memorium\"?\r\n\r\nAs
    for the picture, Cherisse was an intense person. All the pictures we have are
    either a big grin, a quizzical frown, with her mouth wide open, or just bored
    and spacing out. This is the best."

    that it's equal in length to your title. I'd also advise putting a border around
    the title and name too. Something like this is the result I got. \r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/memor2_5361.jpg]"

  body: "James, that is beautiful and classic, especially for something to appear
    in a publication, but it looks...hm, overly formal for someone like Cherisse.\r\n\r\nHer
    best friend came over and looked at the two designs I printed, the one with Serena
    and the traditional one with Caslon [revised as Tomi suggested], and said \"They're
    both lovely, but Cherisse would like this one [the first].\" It's very subjective,
    isn't it?\r\n\r\nIt's to be viewed onscreen by her hundreds of friends and acquaintances,
    not printed in a newspaper, so I think it'll be fine that it's not so traditional.
    \r\n\r\nI did use suggestions from you all for improving the spacing though, and
    it does look better proportioned. "

    intelligent. \r\n\r\nApart from that the best advice I can give you is to step
    back from something and say to yourself: 'What would Cherissa think?' If you knew
    her well, you can't go far wrong :) "
