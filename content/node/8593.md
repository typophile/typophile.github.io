body: 'first, off, i&#39;m relatively new to typography, so please keep this in mind.
  <BR> <BR>consider the following the included image below: <BR> <BR>what effect does
  the placement of the glyph in relation to the VERTICAL red line have on kerning?  or
  does it have an effect?  do only the left and right bearings effect kerning? the
  reason i&#39;m asking is that i&#39;d like to tighten up the kerning but i don&#39;t
  want to do it the wrong way, if there is such a thing. <BR> <BR>i could <BR>1.&#41;
  move the left bearing over the red line and then position the glyph where i want
  it. <BR>2.&#41; simply move the left bearing to the right of the red line <BR> <BR>am
  i correct in assuming both of the above actions produce the same effect or are there
  any side-effects that occur as the result of either action? <BR> <BR>hope i&#39;ve
  been clear on this.  as i said i&#39;m new, so my terminology is lacking. <BR>   <BR><img
