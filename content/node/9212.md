  body: very cool! seems kinda Cooper-esque to me anyway. The tail of the g could
    be a bit more graceful. some of the characters &#40;a, e, c&#41; seem a bit squooshed
    to me. the f might be nicer with a stronger head??? keep up the good work!

  body: An I&#39;d like to add that the g is far-out. If you address its tail&#39;s
    gracefulness at all move the right hip a tiny bit more right and up and make the
    tailing end longer. ? maybe... <BR> <BR>The c an g match but maybe the c could
    use a little length on the bottom. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: Here is the latest version which has moved away from the thick serifs which
    were giving me a pair bit of trouble. It has gone more towards what someone else
    was talking about - felt-tip calligraphy. I&#39;m still working out proportions
    for the caps. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/65675.png"

  body: Definitely keep the first g form, as an alternate if not the default. Personally,
    I&#39;d keep it as the default on the Erik Spiekermann theory that fonts with
    one weird letter tend to be commercially successful.
