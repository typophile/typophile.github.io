  for a font that implies \"sharp\" \"glass\" \"crisp\"... so far i have been playing
  with engraverlike sans serifs really spaced out. but i guess i am looking for something
  with a bit more character. what i dont want is a very illustrated font with like
  glass peices coming out at all sides. it should be a but more elegant a suggestive
  of \"sharpness\"\r\ni hope im making sense...\r\n"
