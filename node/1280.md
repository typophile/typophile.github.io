body: I am looking for a serif type face that is slightly condensed or half condensed.
  <BR> <BR>Up to now I have been using ITC Garamond Condensed or Times New Roman Condensed.
  I feel the readability is jeopardized with these condensed faces when a certain
  amount of copy is required.  <BR>I know that I can use regular book text copy and
  drop a point and use tracking to achieve a copy fit but would rather  use a slightly
  condensed serif text face if there is one available.  <BR> <BR>I have searched around
  but have not turned up any suitable face. <BR> <BR>The copy is usually for marketing
  brochures and I try to get the client to cut copy but there are times I just have
  to go with what is supplied.  <BR> <BR>Thanks for any suggestions.

  body: 'I&#39;d suggest Octavian and Stone Print. <BR> <BR>But there&#39;s another
    way: choose a font that compresses well, like much of Unger&#39;s work. BTW, my
    own Patria&#42; is also designed to compress well: even down to 65% it&#39;s hard
    &#40;except for some type designers&#41; to see distortions. Please email me if
    you&#39;re interested. <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/805.html"

  body: If you&#39;re looking for something that is actually condensed, just not a
    squished as the two you mention, then you might consider Minion Condensed or Kepler
    Condensed. They&#39;re not quite as narrow and work passably in text. Stone Print
    is also a decent option. You might also look at Concorde Nova. <BR> <BR>I find
    that Minion &#40;regular, not condensed&#41; runs a little on the narrow side,
    but probably not enough for you all by itself. It&#39;s too bad that you can&#39;t
    get the Multiple Master any more, because then you could make up just the right
    custom width -- something right in between. <i>&#42;sigh&#42;</i> <BR> <BR>Good
    luck. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.

  body: I will back Hrant in Patria&#39;s ability to be ondensed well, this is something
    I found to be true, even before he had mentioned it. <BR> <BR>Rawlinson condensed
    is also quite a great face. <BR> <BR>That will be my next purchase from you James

  body: BTW, Janet, it seems counter-intuitive but it might be better to use a slightly
    <i>extended</i> face at a smaller point size instead of a narrower face at your
    chosen point size. This is something to try especially if the atmosphere of elegance
    that narrowness conveys doesn&#39;t fit the subject - so it depends on that context.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still trying to figure this stuff out &#40;since the people who
    really know what&#39;s going on, like the experts at FontBureau, won&#39;t talk
    freely about such &#34;trade secrets&#34;&#41; but it&#39;s starting to seem to
    me that when you match the economy &#40;surface area usage&#41; of a narrower
    font versus a wider font at a smaller size, the latter maintains a greater apparent
    size - something readers generally appreciate. <BR> <BR>Also note that the more
    linebreaks in the copy, the less narrowness will help you &#40;versus wide&amp;small&#41;,
    because the horizontal savings you&#39;re accumulating over each line of a paragraph
    gets negated for every linebreak where you haven&#39;t saved an entire line thanks
    to the savings. Did I explain that OK? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Thanks Kyle! Note
    that Patria&#39;s <i>italic</i> however starts becoming insufficiently differentiable
    from its roman &#34;master&#34; in the role of emphasis when condensed, because
    its slight slant starts becoming invisible. The good news is that the face has
    four closely gradated weights, so you can substitute the Light &#40;or maybe even
    the Demi&#41; italic in a body of regular if it&#39;s blending in too much &#40;I&#39;m
    talking about when it&#39;s condensed&#41;. BTW, Patria&#39;s close weights also
    enable acceptable fake smallcaps - this I learned from Kyle!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Several of my designs are semi-condensed. <BR>Beaufort, Worldwide. And Brown,
    a matching sans. They were mostly developed for a client/friend of mine, Tony
    Sutton, who likes them that way for newspaper use.

    faces. Don&#39;t recommend something you don&#39;t like.

  body: Thanks for all the suggestions. <BR> <BR>I ended up using Minion Narrow MM
    since it fitted the space and was highly readable set at 10/13. I also happened
    to have that  font in my collection. It was a much better choice than what I had
    been using before since it did not have that squished look and it took up the
    same amount of copy space as ITC Garamond Condensed or Times New Roman Condensed.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks once again. <BR> <BR>Janet
