body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve got a problem with trapping:\r\nDiagonal lines (0.25pt)
  with a black PMS color that are on top of a gold surface.\r\n\r\n- The lines are
  PMS black and have a 0.25 pt line-weight.\r\n- The area where the lines cover the
  gold are extracted from the gold.\r\n- The golden object is given an outline stroke
  (centered) of 0.14 pt and set to overprint.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that the gold
  overprints the black, but the black lines are so thin that the remaining line-weight
  ends up at 0.11pt! (0.25-0.14pt).\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the best way to fix this?\r\n-
  Let the black lines overprint the gold?\r\n- Let the gold overprint the black lines
  but change the line weight\r\n\r\nHope theres someone who can help me out,\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: "Wim's response is the sensible option: overprinting the black will improve
    the results; however, it won't completely solve the problem.\r\n\r\nBlack ink
    appears black on paper because it absorbs\u2014to a greater or lesser degree\u2014all
    reflected light from the substrate beneath it. Metallic inks, on the other hand,
    are so-called because they reflect more light than ordinary inks do; therefore,
    even overprinted black isn't going to look entirely black. But it will look better
    than what you're getting now."

    the solution is printing the black plate twice for better coverage. Or printing
    the logo in a black foil (although I suspect the thin lines would be a problem,
    but I don't have enough experience with foils to know).\r\n\r\nIn any event, this
    is an issue you should discuss with your printer."

  body: The problem is that you have a logo designed by someone without a lot of insight
    into good logo design practices and foresight into branding. Honestly, why would
    someone make a logo like this? Perhaps I would have to see it to understand why
    someone would do this besides lack of experience. Images??

    \r\nWTF? Why? I would like to help but I don't understand what you are talking
    about.\r\n\r\n\"Let the black lines overprint the gold?\"\r\nI don't fully understand
    what you're doing there, but that sounds like that's you're best bet. Especially
    when lines are that thin. Anytime you have thin lines you are forced to over print
    them onto what ever is beneath them. What else can you do? And I would not double
    print lines that thin. If the second printing's registration is off one little
    bit it will screw it up."

    no, thin lines don't always demand overprinting. If my design had thin true red
    lines within a true yellow square, the lines would print in solid magenta over
    or under\u2014and preferably under\u2014the solid yellow square."

  body: '@oldnick, the more inks you have mixing together to make a hairline, the
    more danger you have of mis-registraion and fuzzy multicolored lines. If you want
    a 100 percent guarantee of a sharp line, you use only 1 ink for that line, and
    you overprint it onto what''s underneath, without trying to do some kind of tricky
    knockout. That''s not called trapping. That''s called VERY VERY VERY VERY risky
    business.'
