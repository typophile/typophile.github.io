  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>I have just signed up to Typophile, finally, after years of casual browsing and checking in on the forums.</p>
<p>I am working on a logo for my company, &lsquo;Bird &amp; Co&rsquo;, the name I use for small freelance jobs outside of my usual day-to-day. I usually team up with specialists such as copywriters etc, hence &lsquo;Co&rsquo;.</p>
<p>My thoughts for the overall branding is to keep things clean and simple, discretely, so that the work speaks for itself. I have been a long admired Caslon IV&rsquo;s Two Line English Egyptian, so used this as a base (and to indulge in personal taste).</p>
<p>Logo needs to work at small and large sizes, positive and negative</p>
<p>I have developed something I am largely happy with, but know the details are not there yet. I am hoping for input to help make this &lsquo;sing&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Weight, kerning, proportions, letterforms, all up for any / all comments</p>
<p>Thanks very much
Christian</p>

<p>type looks good – although it might be a little too loose, especially around the &ldquo;I&rdquo;. But maybe that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>I think the small ampersand lets the brand appear really big. It looks like Bird &amp; Co is a large company and/or institution that has many subsidiaries. If that&rsquo;s what you want, I&rsquo;d keep the ampersand smaller than the rest of the letters, because it visually separates &ldquo;Bird&rdquo; from &ldquo;Co&rdquo;, by introducing a second font size, which makes it two instead of one, thus provoking the feeling of &ldquo;many&rdquo; (at least to me and maybe only very subtle).</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how you want your clients to perceive your business. Maybe you want them to believe you are a big company. Maybe you don&rsquo;t. In the latter case, I suggest you make the ampersand the same size as the other letters to achieve a somewhat uniformed look. Why? I think it communicates integrity. It looks like you are working so closely with your partner specialists that your clients don&rsquo;t even realize there are so many different parties involved.</p>
<p>It really depends on how you want your clients to perceive your business. One more question regarding this: will you be the only one who invoices your client or will your partners send their own invoices?</p>
<p>If you are the only one who handles payment, I suggest you decide whether you want to appear big (small ampersand) or small (normal ampersand).</p>
<p>If your client will receive several invoices, I suggest you clearly separate yourself from your partners by getting rid of &ldquo;&amp; CO&rdquo;. If you are only invoicing your own services, there&rsquo;s no need to mention other working partners in your company name.</p>
<p>Anyway, it looks good :)</p>

<p>Normally businesses prefer to look big, but you bring up a good point. It&rsquo;s common for designers to be part of a team but I would only use &ldquo;&amp; Co&rdquo; unless you have at least one employee besides yourself, or if the other folks are billed through you.</p>
<p>If the copywriters, photographers, etc have their own businesses and do their own billing, your clients will figure that out pretty quickly anyway. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that, but you don&rsquo;t want clients to feel you&rsquo;re giving a false impression of  your company.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Stefan &amp; James</p>
<p>Thank you very much for replying and for your comments.</p>
<p>I have looked at implementing your suggestions. Completely agree with all points, as you&rsquo;ll see in the quick updates I&rsquo;ve been looking at. I&rsquo;ve tweaked a number of the letters too.</p>
<p>I feel the ampersand should be a little smaller, to help create some visual contrast with the letterforms, so seems to work well being about the size of the largest counter, it was far too small before - and would impede my ability to use at very small sizes legibly.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
