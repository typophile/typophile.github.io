  body: An icon of the <em>whole</em> telephone rather than just the handset would
    be more in line with the rectangular-block look of the other icons, and would
    probably also respond more noticeably to a perspective slant...? (Like the characters
    at Unicode 260E and 260F, [[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2600.pdf]])

    Skewing the symbols looks amateurish to me, in general. And the examples you posted
    look hand-drawn, particularly the first three (probably because of the way the
    antialiasing made the lines thick and thin).\r\n\r\nAnd the telephone image is
    tr\xE8s retro. More than half the telephones in the country are cell phones, and
    that particular handset goes back to the old hard bakelite General Electric things
    that Jon Voight used to kill the preacher in Midnight Cowboy.! <g> "

    (all my colour e-mail blasts have to be tested in greyscale to see what they will
    look like after our salespeople print them out and fax them along). Also, for
    billing, the fax has more legal standing than an e-mail, if a dispute comes to
    court. Not sure if this is just in Canada (or not even in Canada, but in one of
    the other countries we work in).\r\n\r\nAbout the design. Italic symbols are fantastic.
    Great idea and great execution."

    character.  They're images. Try this: set anything in Zapf Dingbats. Then italicize
    the line. Nothing happens. The font is designed not to be italicized. I tried
    it in InDesign. I had to apply a manual skew to the Zapf characters. \r\n\r\nWhen
    image glyphs are slanted, they seem to be tilted in perspective, not just skewed.
    I don't see lines of type that way, unless the line tapers in some way (like the
    Superman nameplate on the comic strip or the narration to the first Star Wars
    movie)."
