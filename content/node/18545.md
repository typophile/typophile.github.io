  trying to come up with a font to use for the navigation and probably header text
  but am drawing a blank.  Ideally I'd like a sans-serif font but am open to other
  options.  Any ideas?\r\n\r\nOn a semi-related topic, does anybody know of any books
  relating to complimentary fonts?  Something to show how fonts can compliment each
  other, showing examples and such, and how to find the right right one.\r\n\r\nThanks."
