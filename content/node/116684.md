  body: "With the tiny serifs and spurs this would make an attractive font. I have
    not seen this design before and believe that if it is a font, it was probably
    made for private use. \r\nAccordingly, I am going to discuss it as if it was lettering.\r\nThe
    lettering artist drew on several 19th century influences.\r\nTiny serifs are rarely
    found in digital typefaces with lowercase letters. An exception is Red Rooster's
    Coliseum http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/coliseum-rr/ The letters would
    have to doubled in width to compare to _Yellowhead_. The combination of small
    spurs and a concave effect on the sides of some letters evokes the spirit of Antique
    Tuscan http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/antique-tuscan/\r\nDon"

  body: "To make the letters one could start with Trump Gothic Bold http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-gothic-pro/
    -- which has letter-forms that are fairly close to the image -- widen the letters
    to the same relative width, and tack on the miniserifs and tiny spurs.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thank you for the response, guys! \r\n\r\nI have reason to believe it's actually
    a font as another designer worked with the logo previously. I saw the artwork
    and there are usually tell-tale signs of reproduction, but I couldn't find a thing,
    even the top spurs on the 'e' are squared off just like the original (most samples
    of the logo I can find are small to trace from with the exception of the one I
    blew up above).\r\n\r\nAny idea on a base font without the spurs? I've found a
    few close matches but I'm mainly having trouble matching the 'w' and 'a'. \r\n\r\nI've
    never had to source a second opinion on a font until yesterday and I'm glad I
    found this website; it's also opened the doors to some fresh new font content
    I never knew about! \r\n\r\nEDIT - thanks donshottype, just read your post. That's
    closer than my EF TV Nord Cond Bold! "
