    been around for some time when the second wave (far bigger than the first) of
    Dutch type creators hit the market (Swift was released in 1985, Dan \u2014 before
    L, after T). Adding to that that Noordzij is very influential (through his long

    brings to mind one of my earliest posts to this forum, which provoked a reply
    to the effect that I certainly couldn't be a type designer myself - which, indeed,
    I am not.\r\n\r\nIn my na\xEFvet\xE9, I had assumed that drawings with \"that

    creation of a worthwhile typeface (for certain purposes, at least), and it was
    unclear to me that a mouse and a computer screen would lend themselves to producing
    them - at least, my experience with paint programs did not lead me to be sanguine.\r\n\r\nSo
    I thought that perhaps one would be better off making the drawings on paper, putting
    graph paper over them, and specifying the endpoints of the component splines of
    each glyph as numbers - something which font making programs generally don't provide

    were digitized, except that they used a special mouse with crosshairs to input
    the x,y coordinates instead of typing them in. When you have existing analog art
    (which is pretty much all they had back then), it's a practical method. But once

    and say that the earlier one influenced the later.\r\nThe design of new oldstyles,
    informed by the pen stroke, has a long tradition, many threads.\r\n\r\nThe old
    style tradition I was familiar with ran through Gill and Syntax, in the sans serifs,
    and Goudy and Usherwood's types in the serifs.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to overestimate
    the exposure that existed locally, to foreign types, in the past, pre-Internet.\r\nCertainly,
    there was an international type scene, but nowhere near as broad and open as it
    is now.\r\nIt depended much more on the scope of foundries' advertising and promotion,
    and local distributors.\r\nIn the first decade of digital fonts, roughly 1988-98,
    promotion was done primarily via direct mail and trade journals, and there was
    a very real language barrier, more so going to English than the other way around.\r\n\r\nRather
    than Lexicon, I was very aware of contemporary types like FF Thesis, FF Quadraat
    and FF Scala, because as a Canadian Mac-using art director I was targeted by FontShop
    International, but up until a few years ago I always thought that Enschede was
    an obscure, old-fashioned foundry with a very small niche, not much of a player.
    Such is prejudice! LettError were rockstars, but although the \"stroked\" Advert
    was part of their work, it was the oddity, they were better known for being random
    and distressed.\r\n\r\nIn North America, most eyes were turned West, not East,
    pointed by Raygun and Emigre magazines, or if West, towards the work of Neville
    Brody, he and Carson being heavily popularized by monographs. Looking west to
    Wired magazine, TheMix came into view.\r\n\r\nA lot of this Dutch style, with
    its large x-height and shorter-than-ascender cap height, and its micro-detailing,
    is like the ITC faces of the 1970 and early '80s.\r\nITC Garamond, ITC Caxton,
    ITC Berkeley, ITC Veljovic, ITC Giovanni, ITC Galliard, ITC Usherwood, ITC Tiepolo,
    etc.\r\nBut who would dare say that classic ITC influenced the recent \"Dutch
    School\"?!\r\n\r\nWhen I designed the humanist sans Sensibility for the Globe
    and Mail in 2007, one critic dismissed it as Dutch wannabee, comparing it with
    Auto, but I was working within my own tradition\u2014it was a development of Shinn

    with digital type as more and more designers begin working in tools like Fontographer
    and FontLab, rather than using plotting systems such as Ikarus. In other words,
    it corresponds to the industrial period during which type was manufactured by
    technicians rather than by craftsmen. Prior to the pantograph, when punches were
    cut by hand, the drawings provided by the designer needed only to convey the character
    of the design: the proper balancing of weight, the spacing and alignment, etc.
    was provided by the punchcutter. Somewhere, Hermann Zapf writes about this in
    terms of his collaborations with the punchcutter August Rosenberger, during which
    he realised that his drawing didn't need to be perfect because they would be interpreted
    by Rosenberger. Similarly, today, while drawing remains an efficient way to develop
    ideas, those drawings do not need to be completed to technical standards, since
    more often than not the designer is also the manufacturer, who can take a craft
    approach to the interpretation of those ideas in font software.\r\n\r\nBram de
    Does learned his craft in the era when finished drawings were a necessary stage
    of manufacture. I've worked with other designers who began work in that period
    and who still prefer to work in this way, not because it is necessary, but because
    they have trained themselves to think through this process. Tim Holloway still
    produces beautifully finished drawings, even though he digitises these himself
    and may, in the process, make further modifications to the design at the outline
    stage. Most of my contemporaries, though, work directly in the digital medium
    and, if they draw at all, only produce sketches and roughs, not finished 'artwork'."

    completely accurate to the final product. That why most type designers now spend
    most of their drawing time with Bezier curves.  \r\n\r\nOf course the final result
    you want is not the digital font, but something rendered on screen or paper, and
    this may be significantly different. So the vector outline needs to be proofed

    It's clear to me that typefaces were originally designed by cutting punches because
    that's what the available technology made necessary - and this was an obstacle
    in the way of the goal of faithfully copying styles of penmanship. Which was what
    type design started out as being about, until people gradually became aware of
    other possibilities, and exploring them became acceptable.\r\n\r\n@William Berkson:\r\n<cite>Since
    the end product, the digital font, is a set of vector drawings, this is completely
    accurate to the final product. That why most type designers now spend most of
    their drawing time with Bezier curves.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt's perfectly reasonable
    to work on the end product rather than something which is only a sketch, and which
    can't be transferred to the end product except by redrawing it.\r\n\r\nI am positively
    impressed by news of input devices like the Inkling, because it does seem to me
    that, even if it isn't nearly as bad as punch-cutting, the mouse-to-computer-screen
    interface really does stand in the way of control over one's design.\r\n\r\nIt
    may even be why a lot of recent typefaces seem to look all the same to me."

  body: I'm not sure that you understood my point, which is that the way most of us
    make digital type today is more like the way in which type was made when punches
    were cut by hand than during the industrial, machine period, because both punchcutting
    and today's common methods involve design within the manufacturing process, whereas
    the industrial process separated design and manufacture.

    and exploring them became acceptable.\r\n\r\nUm, no. The Gutenberg Bible was 1455.
    Jenson's Roman was 1475, only 20 years later, and it already started modifying
    the stroke in a way different from pen-drawn. And it was done for both aesthetic,
    and I think readability reasons. As we have discussed here before, as soon as
    you have type, which repeats the same exact shape for each letter, the design
    demands have changed, and call for much more strict control, as well as the need
    for the shape to relate to every other letter. \r\n\r\nHand writing is a different
    animal than built-up or cut-out letters. That's why it can inform design in a
    different way from building up. The pen front of a broad pen has its own rules,
    and creates its own natural variations. But when it comes to punch cutting, before
    1890, or built up type with pencil and paper\u20141890 to 1985\u2014or drawing
    with bezier curves, it's really not fundamentally different, in that it's the
    eye and not the tool that determine the shape. There are influences of the tool
    in each case, but the fundamental thing is gradually building up the letter, as
    judged by the eye. Punch cutting had the disadvantage of only being able to take
    away, not add. Bezier curves are not as natural to draw with as a pencil, which
    is a drawback. But you can move things around, adding or reducing a stroke, even
    more easily, which is a plus.   "

    is much more particular: Jenson's types formalised the uppercase letters along
    classical Roman lines, reflecting larger woodcut letters already in use pre-type
    rather than the written capitals of the humanist book hand.* This in turn prompted
    modelling the lowercase in the same way: it isn't as if the shapes of the humanist
    bookhand failed to 'relate to every other letter', but that they related in a
    different way. To put it another way: the scribes wrote their majuscule letters
    in a way that harmonised with their minuscule letters; Jenson designed his minuscule
    letters in a way that harmonised with his majuscule letters.\r\n___\r\n\r\n* I
    see this as another example of text type being tailored upwards to a larger document
    aesthetic, itself part of a broader cultural aesthetic. This is why it is helpful
    to look at the illustrations and, particularly, decorative caps and other ornamentation
    of renaissance books, to understand the context in which the classical Roman capitals
    provide the model for the new roman types. I don't believe there is anything internal
    to typography that demanded those forms, and if it weren't for the broader context
    I don't see a reason for Jenson to have veered from the humanist bookhand that
    was the scribal norm.\r\n\r\nTwo books are particularly worth perusing:\r\n\r\nGrafton,

    aren't the tool.\r\nThe constraint of working with a mouse, trackball, or stylus
    as the hand tool is that one isn't looking at the tool tip, but aiming a cursor.
    But that is an adjustment that can be learned, and I don't think it effects precision,
    because one can zoom in.\r\n\r\nThe constraint of working with old media (which,
    BTW, is no more \"natural\" than digital media) is quite pertinent to type\u2014namely
    that one is trying to create a hard, clean, high-contrast image. This is very
    difficult with pen and ink, much easier in PostScript. I would argue that it is
    more natural\u2014with greater \"truth to materials\" to draw digital type with
    a stylus and tablet, rather than pen and ink.\r\n\r\nThe idea that drawing with
    pencil or pen and paper is natural is incorrect. Those are merely the primitive
    media we learn with, which do have an important historical status; but tradition
    is not nature.\r\n\r\nThe only advantage that old media has is its ability to
    capture the vitality of gestural movement, and this has two aspects. Firstly,
    the deft touch can be a way of making a delicate, precise mark, but as I said,
    this is rendered redundant by zooming on screen.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in certain types,
    for certain kinds of curve, the gestural line has a human authenticity which the
    constructed curve (or one drawn with pen and french curve or templates) does not
    have, although it can be mimicked to a degree.\r\n\r\nAnd if one is working with
    gestural shape, the overall effect tends to have a subtle, organic quality. \r\n\r\nHowever,
    it seems to me that the rigidity of PostScript type forms, such as it is, is informed
    by hinting requirements\u2014the standardization of alignment zones and stem widths
    in particular, and perhaps the desire of typographers who are able to inspect
    type zoomed right in, to see that it is \"clean\", equating cleanliness with professionalism.
    (Maybe one reason Arial gets such a bad rap.) But there is no fundamental reason
    to make digital styles antiseptically neat and tidy; I drew Oneleigh roughly,
    scanned it, traced it with a bezier line, and cleaned it up\u2014but as I had
    not been working on a grid, this only involved making the fit sweet and the details
    pretty, not standardizing vertical metrics and stem widths.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen
    Lexicon hinted on screen, but I would imagine it's a bit gnarly, with details
    like the unequal stem widths of \"o\"."

    the way he makes the letters different from what would be written by a scribe.
    They are more upright, the serifs more horizontal, and the changes in weight depart
    from the pen, going toward more even color than scribal writing would have. Jenson's
    page is extremely even, strikingly more so than a manuscript, I think. \r\n\r\nJohn,
    the other issue of how to harmonize the caps, which evolved out of a brush drawn
    letter, and the lower case, which came from the pen, is related but not the same.
    I guess I wasn't clear, but I was referring to being vertical and adjusting weights
    for evenness of color.    \r\n\r\nThe overall point, which I think we agree on,
    is that while type is derived from writing, it is also modified, and both the
    ancestry and the modification are important. The modification involves sculpting,
    rather than writing. So some of the gestural qualities that Nick refers are retained\u2014particularly
    in Jenson\u2014but they are also modified. I don't know how people work with connected
    scripts that are supposed to look more like they came from the hand, but I think
    with roman text type a lot of the work is the sculptural thing. And that is best
    done with the precision of the Bezier curve. \r\n\r\nNick, when I said less natural,

    simpler than with pen on paper using templates, t-square & set-square, or compasses.\r\nAnd
    applying a manual transformation (scale, skew, rotate) interactively is positively
    transcendental in its WYSIWG-ness, compared with old media.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,
    with old media one has to deal with ink flow and the tooth of paper.\r\n\r\nNone
    of these different qualities of new and old media are bugs, they are features.
    The tooth of paper, for instance, provides the fundamental upstroke-downstroke
    construction of letter forms, just as the width of a broad pen provides contrast
    and stress.\r\n\r\nBy being able to imitate all forms of previous media, digital
    media appears to have no style of its own, but surely this is a fallacy, because
    the same situation occurs with every fresh generation of technology.\r\n\r\nJust
    because digital media finds it so easy to mine analog media for form and content,

  body: "Bill, I think the uprightness of the Jenson letters and the horizontality
    of the serifs is directly related to harmonisation with the classical capitals.
    If you look at the use of capitals in manuscripts of the period, especially prestige
    editions, you see a move towards drawn capitals based on classical model, rather
    than written forms, as part of the overall aesthetic. The letters are a) more
    regularly upright and b) the serifs are flatter and more horizontal. These are
    exactly the characteristics that you observe Jenson applying to both upper- and
    lowercase.\r\n\r\nThe variations of weight are more interesting and, as you say,
    not directly related to the harmonisation of the cases, but I interpret them slightly
    differently from you. Jenson's types are smaller than most preceding types and
    almost all scribal bookhands. I think Jenson's genius is in achieving a great
    evenness of tone at these new, small sizes while anticipating print conditions
    of paper and ink (over which he had control, of course). That is to say, I think
    the variations in weight that he 'sculpts' in the punches are reactive to size
    and conditions. Manuscript letters tend to be sharper than print, since they are
    not pressed into the fabric of the paper but are defined by the sharp edge of
    the nib, so typographic letters need to compensate in various ways for the conditions
    of their reproduction, as well as optically for their smaller size.\r\n\r\nEarlier
    in the thread you referred to type 'which repeats the same exact shape for each
    letter'. In fact, the accurate reproduction of a the same shape for each instance
    of a letter is a relatively recent phenomenon that is pretty much impossible to
    attain in hand-pulled letterpress printing. The evenness of inking doesn't come
    about until roller systems are introduced, and it isn't until offset lithography
    does away with the impression of metal into fibre that significant variation disappears.
    Witness my <a href=\"http://tiro.com/John/Baskerville-a.jpg\">collection of Baskerville
    lowercase a letters</a> from a single page of one book that he printed himself.
    A scribe needs to write very slowly and carefully to faithfully reproduce the
    same shape of a letter in two places, but he can get the same ink density and
    sharpness of the letter with an ease that escaped the printers."

    because of varying ink spread is still much less than the variation in spacing
    and letter width and shape in a hand-written manuscript. \r\n\r\nIn other words,
    I think you are underestimating the way type, as opposed to handwriting, forces
    the issue of evenness of color to the attention of the producer of type. This

    this stuff, and evenness of colour is not an issue, far less so than in the frequently
    unevenly inked early printing; the latter, of course, is not the fault of the
