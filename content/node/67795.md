  starting out with design in school and have noticed that something can be very beautiful
  with just type that is kerned well. Unfortunately I assume it will take me years
  of practice to be good at it.Some professional help would be nice :) Anyway thanks!   also
  if you have any suggestions on how to make the drop shaddow or ice type "more real"
  that would be nice.   [img:sites/default/files/old-images/badkerning_4800.jpg]
