		<div class="commentbody">Good suggestion. Eagle would probably be a good choice for this industry. <BR> <BR>During my initial consultation with the client, we determined that the most important elements to the customer relationship are trust and reliability. Recognizing the need for boldness (&quot;aggressive and macho&quot;) within industry applications and considering the look of reliability, I created the bold DETEX type. Also recognizing that most pest control is sold door-to-door during the day, I knew that the logo needed to be soft enough for a predominantly female market, hense, the soft &quot;E's&quot; and the gray (vs. Unocal blue) and orange (vs. the industry standard red) combination. I felt that this would help create warmth, rather than aggressive heat, and contribute to the trust factor. <BR> <BR>I'm thinking that the space between the name and title on the bizcard needs to be decreased</div>

Of course though, the shape of the card and the fly are a perfect fit and maybe a cockroach on your bizcard isn't the best idea&hellip; :-D. Maybe the DETEX could be a bit smaller and the typeface for the name and tel# and so on isn't my cuppa, for that kinda business and that logo a sans serif would be a better fit.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

Perhaps just make those the corporate colors and let them use blue vs. grey depending on situation.' <BR> <BR>I don't usually consider flies a pest. A bit annoying, but usually a sign that the mulch needs taking out rather than a need for an exterminator. As for insects-that-fit-on-a-bcard, I'd say the ant is a good idea.

		<div class="commentbody">Scott, <BR> <BR>I like the design. However, I would like to see a darker blue that doesn't have as much brightness. Because the orange is bright, I think a duller blue would make the orange and blue work better together. Your &quot;e's&quot; feel like they have too much curve. I also don't like the middle bars being different lengths than the outer bars.  <BR> <BR>The &quot;E&quot; connecting only at the bottom of the &quot;X&quot; seems odd because the top has the same relationship as the bottom, and they don't connect. (I hope that made sense) I don't see anything wrong with just joining the e and the t. Joining the &quot;e&quot; and &quot;x&quot; seems forced. <BR> <BR>I think pest control could be a sans serif different than the title. I just used univers- I am sure you could find a better one. The orange arrow feels better with the same space between it and the &quot;x&quot; as the thickness of the font. I Hope this helps. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19345.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>-Tom</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Scott. <BR> <BR>Not bad so far. <BR> <BR>Nice card shape - corresponding with the logo. <BR> <BR>But: the before/after thing (as is) does not at all work for me. Nobody can tell (without inspecting the card with a magnifier) which ant (or fly) is alive and which is killed. People might think: &quot;Before: grey fly, after: white fly - cool, that's what I always wanted to spend my money for&quot;. :-) <BR> <BR>And do away with that &quot;see other side for 'before'&quot; instruction. That sounds sort of silly. ,-) <BR> <BR>Maybe the happy vermin/poisoned vermin idea would work if somehow differently done. But, actually, I'm not sure whether such a (tendentially nasty) illustration should be on a card. Maybe it should. I'm a bit undecided here. ,-) <BR> <BR>I wouldn't make the job title lowercase only. I see no reason to do this. <BR> <BR>I guess I don't prefer the grey over the customer's blue. <BR>The grey might seem to be a bit more sophisticated, but IMO the dark blue suits the business well. <BR>Hrant's right: three colors in the logo are too much. <BR>Tom's colors are very strong. I think I like them. <BR> <BR>regards <BR>jpg</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all for the incredible critique. Unfortunately, I have become somewhat overloaded with work and will not have time to address each of your helpful comments, but let me assure you that I have used all of your postings to get this design to where it is now. <BR> <BR>Due to a client response lull, I had some time away from this project. I hope that I remembered everything that I intended to do. Take a look and let me know if I'm still missing some things. I tried to apply a lot of changes to this revision this afternoon and I fear I may have even missed some of the positive adjustments I made on previous versions. <BR> <BR>The colors are confirmed and due to budget constraints, I need to keep the cards down to 2/1. Because of this we now have a dark blue ant. I think it is small enough that it will still work. On the reverse side, I went with the ant on its back with its let up in the air. The tag line, &quot;after DETEX&quot;, probably needs to be present for people who haven't followed this thread to get it. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for all your help. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19798.jpg" alt="Detex Identity"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Scott, everything is looking good here.  I wouldn't worry about that other detex logo, sometimes certain letters just come together in certain ways. <BR> <BR>My only note is that I am not so sure on the type on the back of the card. HAving pest controller off to the right isn't sitting that well with me. Perhaps there needs to be a little more of a margin between the text on the left and the text on the right.  I do see why you are shifting towards the right, but perhaps it needs to move over 20 pixels. <BR> <BR>just a thought</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you Peter. Good suggestion, which I needed to hear. My amateur typographical eyes see these things, but I'm still not refined enough to know whether they work or not. <BR> <BR>What if I scattered a few letters from &quot;PEST CONTROLLER&quot; as if they were crumbs that the ant is attracted to?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Scott <BR>I really like your design, especially the use of the orange wedge shape, which is repeated in the shape of the card. <BR> <BR>When I was growing up in Florida (I now live in Washington) there was this pest control company that had a cute mouse-like logo, and their vehicles were bright yellow VW Bugs with big three-dimensional mouse ears on the roof, a big mouse tail attached to the rear end, and three-dimensional whiskers attached to the front bumper. As a child it was fun to spot them in the sea of otherwise boring 70s-mobiles (ah, suburban sprawl). <BR>I looked them up and they're still around (maybe you've heard of them &ndash; people here in the Northeast haven't). I'm attaching a couple of jpegs. An example of rare humor in the pest control industry. <BR> <BR>Their &quot;mouse&quot; logo became so familiar to people in that area that the company started doing ads with a sign-off of the mouse ears, whiskers and tail without the words Truly Nolen&hellip; sort of like what Target does now. <BR> <BR>Good luck with your project. <BR> <BR>Troy <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20213.jpg" alt="image 1"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20214.jpg" alt="image 2"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">In case anyone's interested. The trucks turned out OK. I had a flashier design for the trucks that involved a lot more orange, but it was too expensive. So we went conservative, but it still makes a loud professional statement considering the small size of this pest control company (5 trucks). <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/23985.jpg" alt="Detex truck"> <BR> <BR>BTW, the orange hose was just one of those luck of the Irish (I'm about an eighth Irish) coincidences.</div>
