body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI'm currently preparing myself for building my own website
  (which still might take a while, mind you) & I was thinking about putting useful
  information on it for graphic designers in general. One thing I wanted to do, is
  put a RGB/CMYK/Pantone (& possibly RAL) conversion table on it & also a list of
  fonts which are known under several names. I'm thinking of retro fonts that have
  now been digitilized (eg. Jackson that is now available from Linotype as Laughin)
  & also fonts that are cloned and widely spread over the internet. I've often experienced
  (even at work) that we had font clones without even knowing it (eg. we had Arnold
  Bocklin, but also Horizon which -some kerning aside maybe- is basically the same).
  I had a few sites that mentioned font clones in my favourites list, but they no
  longer exist.\r\nSo if anyone knows of any fonts with several names, please let
  me know, I'll be sure to acknowledge you if I ever manage to get my site online
  ;-)"

    or just renamed digital versions of metal types? I know Nick Curtis has reproduced
    a number of metal types with new names (eg. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/filibuster-nf/\">Congress/Filibuster</a>).\r\n\r\nAbout.com
    has several pages of aliases:\r\nhttp://desktoppub.about.com/cs/findafont/a/fontaliases_a.htm"

    As an employee you're sometimes working with ripoofs without even knowing it &
    if you manage to identify the font you need, this kind of list might come in handy.

  body: "That sounds like a great resource. On the color side, I was just trying to
    find something like that. When I couldn't find anything exactly like what I was
    looking for I started kicking around the idea of making a reference document,
    or website that would have RGB/CMYK/Pantone conversions as well as names that
    are associated with certain colors. That seems like it could really help with
    client communication because a designer could both use names the Client is more
    familiar with and look up color names that a client mentions.\r\n\r\nSorry if
    that's a little off topic,\r\n\r\nDuncan"

    a lot easier. I used to have a few of those colour conversion sites amongst my
    favourites as well, but none of them were complete. And I've also often found
    myself knowing the name of a \"real\" font, knowing that we h\xE0d it at work,
    but not being able to find the name under which we had it. I just thought to combine
    all these things in one user friendly site. The only problem is that the internet
    is my only source & that I will have to gather all the information myself, so
    if anyone here has links for fontclones, colour conversions or other ideas, please
    don't hesitate to post 'em here."

  body: "You need to get your hands on \r\n\r\n1. The Bitstream Font Analogue (1992?)
    \u2013 which listed Bitstream fontnames against the respective standard industry
    names. This info may be on their website, but I've never found it. They tend to
    rely on the 'family tree' view on myfonts.com to provide names of equivalent faces
    from other foundries.\r\n\r\n2. A Manual of Comparative Typography by Benjamin
    Bauermeister, 1988, Van Nostrand Reinhold, N.Y. lists many alternative names from
    other photosetting suppliers for quite a few of the standards.\r\n\r\n(Shameless
    plug!) some of the above information made it into the 'see also' sections of the
    individual font pages at <a href=\"http://www.100types.com/100types.com.list.html\">my
    site about the so-called top 100</a>. So for example, if you look for Akzidenz
    Grotesk there you'll see <em>'See also;\r\nAmsterdam Mercator, Bauer Venus, Stempel
    Reform Grotesk, Haas Normal Grotesk, Bauer Folio, Linotype Basic Commercial, BT
    Gothic 725.</em> \r\n...and so on. In this particular listing I can say that only
    the last two are AG under other names from different foundries. Generally, I leave
    it to the viewer to decide which typefaces are simply close in design and which
    are rip-off.\r\n\r\nI think Daniel Will Harris has something on this at his site
    too; try starting at http://www.will-harris.com/esperfonto/"
