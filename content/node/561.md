  I had promised a scan of the article from the October 2001 issue of AXIS that spoke
  briefly about its design. <BR> <BR>Here it is. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: axisfont-12696.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*1108.8*AXIS+font+article%2e+AXIS+%2393%26%2344%3b+10%2e01*axisfont%2epdf

  <BR> <BR>I tried to add this directly to the thread, but couldn&#39;t work it out.
  Are threads closed once they pass into the archive? Or am I just useless? <BR> <BR>Please
  don&#39;t answer the second question. <BR> <BR>p'

  body: 'Yes. Skimming the Japanese, I do not find his name there either. The article
    seems to focus not so much on the creators or creation of the typeface as much
    as the conditions for making the face and the result as a product. <BR> <BR>Sadly,
    this article reflects what I am used to seeing in Japanese editorial &#40;though
    certainly not unique to the Japanese&#41;: a lot of colorful talk, with very little
    to say. <BR> <BR>An entertaining example is &#34;I say that typefaces are words
    that you can see.&#34;  <BR> <BR>Golly, I never thought of it <i>that</i> way!
    Just wish I was so insightful &#40;and I am being only slightly facetious&#41;.'

  body: Paul, the &#34;development&#34; threads &#40;Design, Critique, Release and
    Build&#41; don&#39;t get archived, allowing &#34;late&#34; posts... I must say
    that it&#39;s pretty clever, although I just realise it now. :-&#41; <BR>
