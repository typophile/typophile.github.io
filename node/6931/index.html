The 'a' is nice too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A couple of things that I noticed. To my eye the 'C' doesn't appear to have enough weight. I think the 'J' needs to be wider or something. Maybe it shouldn't go beyond the baseline. The 'K' looks droopy compared to letters B E F H P and R. Upper arm terminates to low on the vertical I think. I like the 'Q' but I think the slight angle on the tail's terminus doesn't fly. I'd leave it horizontal. I'd think it's okay on the 'p' if it was angled the other way and on the 'q' it looks alright. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I like the rounded square dots a lot. Oh yeah. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The lc 'y' just doesn't do it for me. What about a hooked stem like the 'g'?

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Hanno, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nice work so far. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the y doesn't really do it for me either. I find it a bit irritating, especially at text sizes. Its vertical descender has an optical tendency to the right (which may be partially due to the angled terminal). Maybe design an alternate version for text sizes (and leave the vertical descender to Displays sizes)? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->S and s show a slight tendency to tip over to the right. (The S/s is almost always the character that's the most difficult to balance perfectly.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The s and o look a tiny bit too small (next to the m, for instance). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The O (and Q and o) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->might<!-- raw HTML omitted --> need some optical compensation (rotate the bowl a tad counterclockwise?). Expecially next to the e, the o shows a slight tendency to the right. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The same goes for the D, which looks a bit top-heavy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The t stem looks a bit heavy. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not sure whether I like the J.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your comments and suggestions. After staring at these letters all by myself for a while now, it's great to get some new input.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->An alternate version of the 'y' sounds like a good idea, although I think I'll keep the other one too. It just seemed right to me to draw the y like this, since the whole font has such a strong vertical emphasis.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'll keep working and will post new stuff soon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->greetings, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hanno</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hanno, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nice even color. Overall, it is quite good.  While I like the Greek y, I feel it stops you and gives itself too much attention with its symetry.  The R and the P seem to be a bit too wide on top.

Welcome to typophile. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-quote-!&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->quote:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It just seemed right to me to draw the y like this, since the whole font has such a strong vertical emphasis.&lt;!-/quote-!&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It occurs to me that too much agreement between characters in their stress makes long stretches of body copy tiring to read. If all characters try to be as vertical as possible, you might end up with too consistent a pattern to be scanned quickly. Instead, angling the right stroke of the y makes it easier to distinguish for instance from the j which is predominantly vertical. Another nice thing about angling the stroke of the y is that many english words end in the letter y and so the end of the word slants and has a more recognizable shape. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->punctuation - I'm liking the rounded square in your punctuation. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->B - Need to optically lighten where the two strokes of the bowls come together. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->G - Looks like it's falling over left. Extend the upper arm. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->J - Stroke coming off the top there is a bit confusing. It's having trouble spacing with the I and I have a feeling it won't space well with the other capitals either. If you can come up with a good reason to keep it, maybe it should be shortened and lightened some. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->N - Angled stroke might be too light. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->M - I like the shape of this glyph on its own but it belongs to some other type. The miter on the two sloped strokes is the only pointed join in the capitals. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Q - Maybe it's caused by the angled terminus of the stroke but the tail looks closer to the left side of the bowl. Needs some optical compensation. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->numerals - I like the four numerals you have in the sample paragraph, especially the 1 and 7. Wouldn't mind seeing the rest. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't have perfect typeface recall like some of the folks here, so I can't give you names, but this looks very similar to many other designs I've seen around. Is there some guiding principle that you started from to arrive at these shapes? Did you plan how you might arrive at something different than what's out there already? I ask because I spend a good amount of time trying to imagine designs that haven't already been built and I'm curious if others do the same and how.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">hello everybody,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here's a new pdf showing some more glyphs and the three different weights i'm working on. unfortunately i haven't been able to work on most of the suggestions you made, but i will get to that soon.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->to answer aaron's question: of course i thought about how to create something unique. the idea behind tramway was to create a font based more on rounded squares than on circles, that has a technical feel to it (that is, I think, what jon called &quot;sturdy&quot; and &quot;boxy&quot;), but that is working in small text sizes as well. the boxyness of the basic letterform, the lc 'o', is also how came up with the rounded punctuation. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In order to keep the font legible i try not to break too many conventions. This is why it doesn't look very unusual when you first look at it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it's the details that make this font unique: it's &quot;boxyness&quot;, the emphasis on the vertical und some unusual letterforms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->until then&hellip;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hanno <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->tramway_2.pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> (22.4 k)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice - like a 21st century Interstate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think you need to ramp up the stroke contrast towards the dark end - it looks sort of bloated like this, especially in the tight joins, like the bottom of the &quot;b&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The only lc glyphs that are bothering me are the &quot;k&quot; (too narrow, too grot), and the &quot;r&quot; (too shy).
