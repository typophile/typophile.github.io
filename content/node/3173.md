  href="http://www.liquidlibrary.com" target="_blank">www.liquidlibrary.com</a> in
  their logo?  <BR>Any other ideas on similar fonts would be appreciated &#40;I like  <BR>the
  soft rounded &#34;a&#34;&#41;. Note that I don&#39;t have a subscription  <BR>to
  Liquid Library. <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/26711.gif"

  body: Yes, that&#39;s it. I had to rez down a sample to convince myself <BR>since
    Infinity seen in regular/large pt size seems much more angular. <BR>It&#39;s not
    as fluid in larger pt size unfortunately. <BR>Thanks

  body: Yeah, I tried to match the size of your sample with the Extra Bold / Medium
    links.. You&#39;re right, it does look better when it&#39;s small. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
