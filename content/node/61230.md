body: "I am beginning to generate new weights for a typeface I'm designing.  I've
  tried using the Blend Fonts tool, but noticed FLS added points on several glyphs,
  so looked for alternative.  Naturally, I searched the forums and found the \"Assign
  Font Mask > Define New Axis > Mask to Master\" method.  It seems to be working well,
  with one potential caveat.  When I assign a new font mask I notice that FLS switched
  nodes with smooth connections to sharp ones.  The BCP and nodes positions are identical,
  just the connection type is switched.  My questions are: is this normal?, and will
  it have any deleterious effects as I generate new instances?\r\n\r\nThanks for any
  insights?"
