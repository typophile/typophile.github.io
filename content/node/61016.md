  body: "Note that you have spelled \u2018Stylistic\u2019 as \u2018Sylistic\u2019
    for 17-20. This has no effect on the font, but you might find it convenient to
    have all you stylistic set features grouped together in the feature tree.\r\n\r\nHaving
    lots of features, including some that I suspect are \u2018hijacked\u2019 -- i.e.
    does your \u2018Titling\u2019 feature actually contain titling forms, or are you
    using the feature for something else? -- doesn't really \u2018explain\u2019 things
    to me, because I don't know what you're trying to achieve. Is this a Hebrew font?
    What are all the things that you are putting into these stylistic sets?"

  body: "Hi John:\r\nThe font is indeed a hebrew font.\r\n\r\n meny features are indeed
    \"hijacked\", but Titling is not one of the.\r\n\r\nI use shorter forms for end
    letters such as kaffinal,pefinal\r\nand qof,ayin,lamed when using in titles as
    the user makes smaller spacing between lines.\r\n\r\nSS17-20 are one group.\r\n\r\nto
    start explaining every function is hard.\r\nbut here are some\r\nthe font supports
    automatic distinguish between shevana\\nach\r\ndagesh kal\\hazak and qamats qatan/rachav\r\n\r\npatah
    genuva\r\nalef,ayin,he with sheva in mittle of a word\r\nmapik he\r\n\r\nsome
    features are \"hijacked\" \r\nfor example:\r\n\r\nI hijacked the arabic initial
    and medial forms\r\nfor use in bible scripts\r\nassume we have a word that is
    written one way but said another way, these words come in both versions in the
    text\r\nso the font allows by bracketing these words to either show the word and
    hide brackets by using initial forms or hide brackets and and all text in between
    by using medial forms\r\n\r\nhowever:\r\nI still hav functions i want to add,
    but have no place to\r\n\"HIJACK\" :)"

  body: "Yikes! So you're trying to do ketiv/qere distinction display in glyph substitutions?
    That seems to me a really bad idea. This is a text distinction, and if you want
    a text that includes both forms and can switch between different display options,
    then you probably should use XML tagging of the character strings and base your
    display options on that. OpenType glyph substitution isn't designed to be able
    to handle this kind of thing.\r\n\r\nNever mind hijacking layout features: you're
    hijacking the whole layout model."

  body: I didn't say that OpenType Layout was not able to do the kind of things you
    want to do, I said it was not designed to be able to do these things. So if it
    can do these things it is only by chance, and you can't expect it to always be
    able to do everything you want in this regard, because you might eventually run
    into reasonable limitations. And even if you can do these things with OTL, I still
    maintain that you <em>should not,</em> because what you describe are properly
    text manipulations, which should be applied at the character level, not at the
    glyph level.

  body: "Oh, I see what you mean now. You want to know how to access the \u2018Stretched
    Alternates\u2019 function that appears in the InDesign ME OpenType menu. Good
    question. I've never noticed this before. I presume it is intended for use in
    Arabic, but I can't think to what OTL feature it corresponds. In Arabic, what
    we might consider stretched alternates are a class of swash letters.\r\n\r\nI'll
    write to my contacts at WinSoft and find out how this function works."

  body: I wrote to my WinSoft contacts about the 'Stretched Alternates' function in
    InDesign ME. This is a legacy function that makes use to two private features,
    not part of the OpenType specification, to identify left and right parts of stretched
    connecting forms in a particular Arabic font. This was implemented to support
    this Arabic font, Decotype Naskh (not to be confused with the Naskh type from
    Decotype used in the new Tasmeem add in to InDesign), which was originally in
    the Middle East version of PageMaker and which used this mechanism because OpenType
    contextual substitutions were not available at that time. This function is only
    included in InDesign ME for backwards compatibility.

    suspect this is also a legacy function, using a private feature for the old Decotype
    Naskh font. This distinguishes terminal swash glyphs on reduced widths from those
    on full widths."
