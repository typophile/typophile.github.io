  body: "I don't approve of using a serif italic with a low x-height as the complementary
    italic for a sans-serif face with a large x-height.\r\n\r\nRight now, it seems
    to be just beginning to take shape. But I think you are starting with the most
    important points.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Because the cost of making a new typeface
    is reduced, many experimental typefaces can be made, and some even exploit aspects
    of the tools used to design digital faces.\r\n<li>Because faces are viewed on
    computer monitors, legibility at low resolution is considered.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThese
    certainly are key points.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Optima doesn't turn out well even
    at the higher resolutions of laser printers, due to the subtleties of its flare
    serifs, as Hermann Zapf himself noted, may be wroth a mention. As well, one might
    note how fonts were imitated with different names even for hot metal typesetters
    and later phototypesetting, but this is now aggravated.\r\n\r\nExcept for unusual
    cases like Optima, of course, access to the typographical resources of the past
    has been broadened, and this too is an important effect."
