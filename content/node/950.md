  <BR> <BR>The &#34;Sea Ell&#34; logo is set in a font called Tower. <BR>But I don&#39;t
  know what font the songtitle &#40;The Back Shelf of Your Mind&#41; is. For the time
  being I will call it Back Shelf Condensed Bold. Does anyone know?

    Condensed &#40;the original dutch one&#41;. Cap S and M would fit in there, but
