  body: "Hi there thriller 08,\r\n\r\nThe general opinion about the EA FIFA 14 interface
    font seems to favour Titillium, which is available for D/L from here:\r\nhttp://www.campivisivi.net/titillium/text/stili\r\nPersonally,
    I'm not so sure, because the letter C appears to be a slightly different shape.\r\nCheck
    it out and see what you think!\r\n\r\nOr you could always ask the guys who designed
    the game at Electronic Arts.\r\n\r\nDoghouse Studio"

    body: Ehh, I guess it's close enough but there's a lot of differences between
