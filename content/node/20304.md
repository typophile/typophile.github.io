body: "I am considering doing an Indian Font with non-latin letters as a supplement
  to a \"indianized\" latin font. My first idea was to place the letters in the regular
  boxes, and then providing a keyboard-layout as seen in this website:\r\nhttp://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lab/9988/keyboards.htm\r\n\r\nBut
  then I also studied OSX own Punjabi-font Gurmukhi MT which comes with the OSX, and
  saw that this is done in another way, with Unicode. In this font, the glyphs is
  not where the latin letters are, but in other places marked *** below the standard
  squares. As an example, one font had 402 number of characters allowes instead of
  standard 256 and these new boxes is placed below with a specific Unicode-number.\r\n\r\nIs
  there anyone who has any experience of producing non latin fonts with their given
  unicode numberings? How do this work basically? How do people use it later on? Latin
  Keyboards do not have any possibility to use these \"unicode fonts\", or do they?\r\n\r\nThe
  reason for this Indian alternate version of my Latin alphabet, was not intentionally
  to make a full working Indian font, but more as an \"extra bonus\" for the standard
  font, but then I though that why not make it \"for real\" - and maybe do a font
  where the Indian letters are placed BOTH in the regular latin keyboard AND with
  Unicode.\r\n\r\nIf the questions seems strange, it's because I don't know what I
  am talking about and my english is not native language. =)\r\n\r\nAny knowledge
  on this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    in from the Unicode mode pop-up list.  This will give you a ghosted bitmap in
    the background of the glyphs needed with the proper names and unicode numbers
    in place. Opentype/unicode is the way to go and will live much longer than remapping
    methods. Hopefully Adam will give you more details but there are numerous code
    pages to choose from.  I have done Greek and Cyrillic but there are many more
    available.\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/devangari_5957.png]"

  body: "But I like the easiness of Fontographer, I have not given FontLab that much
    time I must confess, but it feels like Fontographer is more strictly design-oriented,
    while FontLab seems so much more technical and have a lot of \"extras\" that makes
    the design process a little bit more difficult. But maybe I'm just lazy to learn
    it\u2026\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm hoping that Fontographer will get better preview
    resolution on screen and in printing - that part is terrible.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Goran, the Indic scripts are complex writing systems that require not only
    correct (Unicode) text encoding for the basic letters and marks, but also many
    glyph variants (e.g. half forms, conjunct ligatures) and smart layout for mark
    positioning. The Devanagari fonts I am working on at the moment each contain more
    than 650 glyphs, not including Latin characters. I use OpenType Layout for the
    glyph substitution and positioning. One could also make Mac-only AAT format fonts,
    but in any case this isn't something that can be undertaken as an 'extra bonus'
    in a Latin display type. Unlike some elements of Latin typography, the complex
    glyph handling of Indic scripts is not optional: you have to provide complete
    and correct shaping in order for the text to be normally readable.\r\n\r\nAs an
    example, here is some Devanagari text shown (top) with the raw Unicode characters
    before subject to shaping and (below) the correct shaping as applied using OpenType
    Layout. Note that in addition the letter <em>ra</em> becoming a subscript mark
    attached to the preceding letter (in other instances, it would become a superscript
    mark attached to the following letter), and the combination of consonant sequences
    into conjunct ligatures, some glyphs actually change order. All of this needs
    to be handled by the font and an Indic shaping engine.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DevShaSam_6589.gif]\r\n\r\nRegarding
    keyboarding, one would use an appropriate Indian keyboard driver, e.g. Hindi or
    Marathi for the Devanagari script. I used the Windows Hindi keyboard for these
    samples."

    work getting this function properly. I am more design-oriented person, I believe.\r\n\r\nHmm,
    are you perhaps interested in some kind of collaboration in the future?\r\n\r\nI
    have an informal agreement with a Foundry regarding the release of the typeface
    and a strong picture in my head how to design the Indian glyphs to match my indianized
    latin-font."

  body: "<em>Hmm, are you perhaps interested in some kind of collaboration in the
    future?</em>\r\n\r\nI doubt if I would have time, and you would need to persuade
    the foundry to pay for the development because I wouldn't do such work on spec.
    Unless the foundry in question has experience in non-Latin fonts and the Indian
    market in particular, I'm doubtful that they would go for it. But if you are serious,
    why not make some of the Indic glyphs (I'm guessing you are talking about the
    Devanagari script; there are thirteen official scripts used in India!) and if
    they're promising I might be able to put you in touch with some useful people."

  body: Okay. Most of the same kind of shaping rules apply for Gurmukhi as for Devanagari.
    The big divide in terms of shaping behaviour is between northern and southern
    Indian scripts.
