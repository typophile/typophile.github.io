    you shouldn't just include the computer image of your graphics but its applications
    in the real world. For example, let us see your logos on collateral pieces. That
    would be a nice touch on top of the computer image.\r\n\r\nYour logos have too
    many colors in my opinion (max should always be around 3/4) and you should always
    include the black/white version."

  body: "I would add a very thin border to the Nebraska and Nationalites ones to define
    the edge. (Although the Nebraska one seems to have it already in the PDF version.)
    \ \r\n\r\nI agree with the comment about showing collateral pieces (a good mockup
    is fine), and also that a good black & white version is needed for every logo,
    but if you show a b&w version too I'd make it small (electronic media in full
    color is rapidly replacing print). That would also show the logo works in a small
    size.\r\n\r\nBut I don't think the 3 or 4 color idea is as important as it used
    to be (unless it just looks better that way). The client gets free color in electronic
    media, and in print media can use 4-color process if the budget allows or one
    color in budget jobs. "

      pursuing a degree at further cost is a better piece of advice over the more
      simple and less costly: \"practice more\"? \r\n\r\nPhotoshop is a tool, if you
      use it to mock up your designs, I wouldn't dare to call you a fifth grader.

  body: My point was that kids today have computer graphics skills and kids in fifth
    grade do play with PhotoShop - Craig has gone way beyond that but the kids are
    coming up fast behind him and he has to continue to learn and improve. He's off
    to a good start but more training and yes, practice is what will keep him ahead
    of the next wave of designers. And we need to point out that most firms that hire
    designers look at degrees as a necessary requirement. But in the end learning
    more is what it is about not just getting better at what we already know.

  body: "I'm all for college education, but I'm not sure that a master's degree is
    all that important in graphic design unless you plan to teach. But a bachelor's
    degree can be helpful as some design firms like to hire designers who have them,
    plus obviously good education and training is a good thing.\r\n\r\nAlso a student
    needs to think carefully about whether they are more comfortable in the fine arts
    \ or in graphic design. Some overlap but they are very different professions. "

    degree is required. Someone with a higher degree could be extremely book smart

  body: 'You both make good points and an associates degree is a good place to start
    - my point is that may not be the job you want to have for the rest of your career.
    And what you say about only needing a Masters if you want to teach may be good
    advice today but not in ten years. Maybe a BFA in Design and an MBA might be a
    good combo (or Marketing, Communications, or Advertising). No one path is good
    for everyone and I know good designers who have no degrees and are successful,
    just do not close off options early in your working life. A good college education
    does not just make you "book smart" it teaches you to think and to see beyond
    what you know. If you are only learning computer programs and techniques in your
    courses realize you do need more than just that to become a true "creative." '

  body: ">  I know good designers who have no degrees and are successful\r\n\r\nYep,
    so do I.  A degree is a big help if you want to work for a design firm, but if
    you have your own business it's your portfolio, personality, and referrals that
    will get clients. "

    that you are credible and degrees and other training help you establish that. '

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI think it does not look too bad, but the scope is still a bit
    limited. You show off mostly logos, but a logo is mostly only part of an identity,
    so show how it is used in the context, where possible.\r\nThe Boy Scouts of America
    Mid-America Council seems to be a good client, so try to show more of the work
    you did for them, like posters, brochure covers but also content pages showing
    detailed typography. You could also show some sketches to highlight the thinking
    behind the work.\r\n\r\nTry to really make your Portfolio stand out, select only
    the best works, and the works that best highlight the skills you have. I don't
    really understand some of the choices you made, and why some stuff is in your
    online portfolio but not in the PDF, and vice versa. IMHO I would ditch the Nebraska
    posters, as I do not think it is very inspired, quite generic. If you want to
    use this portfolio to get hired in a good firm, it should really make you stand
    out, and be original.\r\n\r\njust my 50 \xA2..."

  body: "> personality and referrals are nice but it \r\n> is your work that keeps
    clients\r\n\r\nObviously the quality of your work is very important, but personality
    can also be important. A successful designer once said to me \"most clients are
    not design experts and can't tell good work from great work, but they know instantly
    if you're friendly and likeable and are giving them good service.\" He was right.\r\n\r\nSure,
    there are designers with bad personalities that are still successful. But in general,
    in professions that deal with clients a good personality is a big plus.\r\n"
