I&rsquo;ve been doodling these glyphs on and off, finally made an alphabet and a digital rendition. These haven&rsquo;t been vectored, or anything near it yet, I&rsquo;m primarily working on letterforms right now.</p>
<p>Suggestions and crits? I&rsquo;m very new to this, I&rsquo;ve made one font prior to this and it was somewhat a disaster. So, this is my second font in the works. Cheers to this being better than [[http://www.fontspace.com/unhinderedreams/vaguely-fatal|Vaguely Fatal]].</p>

I&rsquo;m quite new to the font creation process, and I wasn&rsquo;t looking to just make just a thin font either. I tried to give them a <i>little</i> bit of body(Wound up reworking several characters to adapt to the new weight). Perhaps I&rsquo;m going the wrong way about it? I&rsquo;ve been treating this font the way I draw which may be my first drawback. Pointers?</div>

<li>Well individual characters have different weights.</li>
<li>/g/ is severely unstable (falling to the right)</li>
<li>/l/ seems left slanted because of the long bottom curve</li>
<li>some bowls are square-ish others round&hellip;</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t think those tall points on /ij/ are working (bit too tall)</li>
</ol>
<p>The thing is it&rsquo;s hard to say anything about this design because we don&rsquo;t know your desired intentions with this font. Maybe all the upper observations are desired. Maybe not. Maybe your font should be formal and with great finish detail or maybe wobbly.</p>
<p>Of all the letters so far I like /a/ the most (even thought it needs lots of work). It&rsquo;s bowl shape is particularly interesting. But unfortunately I can&rsquo;t say the same about any of the other letters. They don&rsquo;t even seem to complement each other.</p>
<p>This is a rough start.</p>
<p>What software do you use anyway?
What do you think of your own font (be critical)?
What are your intentions with this font?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Litera: Yeah, I can see that about the weights.</p>
<p>I agree with you about the /g/, I&rsquo;ve yet to design what to do with /g/&rsquo;s tail yet, whether turn it into an eyeglass /g/ or keep it in the same style, but more balanced.</p>
<p>/l/ is another character that didn&rsquo;t quite turn out how I&rsquo;d envisioned it. I&rsquo;ll probably straighten out the /l/</p>
<p>Working at fixing the bowls, I actually know which direction I&rsquo;m going with the bowls; that is, more rounded bowls.</p>
<p>Yeah, I see that as well, I thought it might have worked, it seemed an idea worth trying although it doesn&rsquo;t look as good as I&rsquo;d hoped.</p>
<p>My intentions for this font are to create a somewhat playful sans-serif, playful but crisp and clean(no weird wobbles). I&rsquo;d like it to have capabilities to be used at relatively small sizes and still maintain itself, it&rsquo;s kind of held up with the letters as they are, though they&rsquo;re quite&hellip;well. As you said, they need work. I&rsquo;d also like it to be a professionally acceptable font, which it isn&rsquo;t at all at this point.
The fonts that  partly inspired this are [[http://www.dafont.com/steiner.font|Steiner]], [[http://www.ffonts.net/tag/0/euphemia|Euphemia]], and the slab-serif font, [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/Memphis/fonts/|Memphis]].</p>
<p>Critically speaking; I like the thought of a &ldquo;playful sans-serif&rdquo;(I consider Euphemia slightly playful) and base idea, execution so far isn&rsquo;t all that I&rsquo;m wanting it to be. I&rsquo;m unhappy with the wobbles and weight inconsistencies primarily, next to widths of characters being somewhat haywire. I&rsquo;m aiming at a font that&rsquo;s professionally acceptable(As far fetched as that sounds, it&rsquo;s a goal), and I don&rsquo;t feel I&rsquo;m making that right now. I believe this has potential, needs polished a lot though.</p>
<p>Software wise I use FontCreator 5.6 . I&rsquo;m still new to the program right now, I&rsquo;ve used it only a handful of times, cleaning up initial glyphs has taken the most amount of time so far next to playing with kern.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Based on the fonts you mentioned (mostly geometric) and even though you mention playfulness I think this is a <b>very rough</b> start and there&rsquo;s a lot of work in front of you. Your glyphs don&rsquo;t look geometric at all. As of yet.</p>
<p>I suggest you first get acquainted with the software you&rsquo;re using to produce some nice flowing glyphs and only after you know how to properly use your tools start developing a usable font.</p>
