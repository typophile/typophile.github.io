    in the System Preferences. The you can access the minus sign by pressing Option
    2212.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "P.S. If you have a lot of special characters to type and you don't want to
    use PopChar or the character palette you may try tools like Typinator: http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/\r\nWith
    such tools you can define your own Unicode text replacements, like every time
    you type \"#-\" it woud become am real minus sign, \"#tm\" would become \u2122
    and so on. Even faster than PopChar."
