  Out Numerals</a></em> post on The FontFeed, I need an example of a typeface (preferably
  recent) that has \xBE figures: lining figures that are halfway the x-height and
  the cap height. It should be a typeface that I can link to on <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/\">FontShop.com</a>.
  Thanks in advance."

  body: 'Hi Yves, I don''t know if this is what you are looking for, but [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/williams_caslon_text_ot/|Williams
    Caslon Text]] has small cap figures, which are 2/3 the height of the caps. [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=benton+sans|Benton
    Sans]], which is where I got the idea, also has small caps figures, and probably
    so do some other recent Font Bureau fonts. I''ve found the small caps figures
    actually pretty useful. '

    it doesn't preview at FontShop.com (Because there isn't a c2sc option there, I
    presume)."

  body: "And by \u201Crecent\u201D do you mean more recent than Miller Text (1997)?
    MC maintained Austin\u2019s original three-quarter lining figure scheme, which
    is somewhat endemic to Scotches (as witnessed also in Nick\u2019s interpretations).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MillerText-figs_3686.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nLess
    expected, perhaps, are Dante\u2019s three-quarter lining figs (default in the
    original digital versions). Not usually seen with an oldstyle like this.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Dante-figs_6424.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nBut
    probably not recent enough for you."
