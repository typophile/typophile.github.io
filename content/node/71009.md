body: "I need to match the font of a client's report from 1991. It doesn't have to
  be an exact match, but should match the \"feel\" of the original font. Unfortunately,
  that graphic designer isn't available. Adobe Caslon is as close as I've come, but
  it's too light on the page. I've attached two bits of text - one with the upper
  case \"Q\", and one with the upper case \"J\". \r\n\r\nThanks!"
