body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if you could help me narrow down some
  choices.\r\n\r\n<strong>Requirements:</strong>\r\n\r\n* Company profile: educational/publishing/media
  company in the religion/spirituality genre - helping people use the wisdom of the
  world's religions to enhance the quality of their daily lives\r\n\r\n* Need a strong
  forward-looking workhorse sans family for my company, something to use alongside
  the logo for letterheads, business cards, internal reports, study guides, correspondence,
  etc. May also need it for the sans on the back cover of books.\r\n\r\n* Since I'm
  going to be publishing various media (books, guides, etc), I also wanted to start
  building up my own typeface library, so I wanted it to have some longevity, though
  I am not against making future purchases of new typefaces that make me smile to
  set some text in them :)\r\n\r\n* Keep costs per typeface family under $300, at
  least until my business gets off the ground.\r\n\r\n<strong>Candidates</strong>\r\n\r\n*
  National\r\n\r\n* Proxima Nova\r\n\r\n* Neutraface No. 2\r\n\r\nI'm leaning toward
  Proxima Nova as the overall workhorse, and National when I need something warmer
  and for longer text.\r\n\r\n<strong>Already Ruled Out (mostly due to price for now;
  a few of them I'm just not thrilled about the look)</strong>\r\n\r\n* Priva Pro,
  Prelo, Sophisto, Stalemate, Whitney, Vista Sans, Ronnia, Gotham, FF Strada, Flama,
  Verlag, Lisboa, FF Kievit, FF Legato, Fresco Sans, Mundo Sans, Bliss, Fedra Sans,
  FF Meta, FF Quadraat Sans, FF Scala Sans, Versa Sans\r\n\r\nAny others I should
  consider that would fit my requirements?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\nRahim\r\n"

    gotten a lot of use out of Locator, on a variety of client projects over the last
    4 years.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm really interested (but don't yet own) Orenga:\r\nhttp://vllg.com/Incubator/Orenga/mudTyper+Weights/\r\n\r\nIt
    would probably work better in a supporting role, but it has some humanist qualities
    that may work well in the spirituality area."

  body: "Chris: Locator and Seravek look promising.  Orenga definitely has a soft
    feel.\r\n\r\nStephen: Agenda and FF Bau (very crisp!) are nice.  Ezzo and Leitura
    Sans like to show off their distinctions too much, don't think I can use those
    as workhorses.\r\n\r\nThank you for your suggestions, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nRahim"
