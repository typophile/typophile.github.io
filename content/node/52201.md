    - Setup: choose cCntered for the Page Position.\r\n\r\nThat should do the trick.\r\n\r\n.

    not be able to get better registration. Even with Xante printers I\u2019ve run
    into such bad centering that I had to stick printed sheets back to back using
    a light box."

  body: "Hmmm \r\nI assume your finished size is smaller than your \r\npaper size?\r\nwell
    if you can't shift the page on the printer\r\nthan you could export a pdf with
    crops in\r\nindesign and replace it on a new document\r\n(document size same as
    paper size)\r\nPlace the first page in the center of the page\r\nand the second
    10mm up, down, right, left.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
