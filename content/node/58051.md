body: "I just ran into a strange OT Feature compile occurrence with a recently finished
  monospaced type I just completed.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is when I 'compile' the features
  FL Studio crashes. The whole application quits immediately.\r\n\r\nI immediately
  figured i'd do a trial and error by deleting all of the OT features and add them
  back one at a time but what was strange is after deleting all of them I added a
  basic ligature feature definition (as a quick test) and compiled only to have the
  same problem. Application quit immediately.\r\n\r\nThe feature was as stripped down
  as possible as well, like this:\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\nsub F H by FH;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nSo
  with troubleshooting my feature code solved (being that adding one simple feature
  definition, STILL caused the app to crash) no need to go back through all of the
  features I originally had in the file\u2026\r\n\r\nI decided to just generate the
  font and test it.\r\n\r\nThe results of generating the font file are fine, all the
  features are intact, I tested them all, they work and show up fine, all the glyphs
  are there and everything seems good to go.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I noticed after
  'generating' is the Output window contained this:\r\n\r\nsalt\r\naalt\r\ntitl\r\nfrac\r\nss01\r\nss02\r\nss03\r\nss04\r\nss05\r\nss06\r\nss07\r\nss08\r\n[WARNING]
  <TestI-Regular> The feature file OS/2 overrides TypoAscender and TypoDescender do
  not sum to the font bbox size!\r\n\r\nAny ideas? Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nOpening
  any previous font build and 'compiling' is fine.\r\n\r\nIt just happens to be this
  particular font file and I have no idea why.\r\n\r\nAt this point since the generated
  file seems to be fine I'm assuming it is some type of glitch and proceeding forward
  but if anyone else has any similar experience or know what the problem might be
  please advise.\r\n\r\nThis problem is definitely the first of it's kind for me.
  I've had a few feature syntax errors in the past that would be described in the
  Output window that I've successfully fixed with no crashing of the app so this whole
  problem so far doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nIf there was a real issue it seems the
  font wouldn't successfully 'generate', or the Output window would list a more serious
  problem when generating, correct?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMike"
