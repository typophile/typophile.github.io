  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>HI All, 
I&rsquo;m having major problems getting the Candian dictionary in InDesign to work in my documents. Our text is breaking in horrible ways right now after I&rsquo;ve tried to fix it. Needless to say, my co-workers are angry at me. It was my idea to switch our dictionary to Canadian from US.</p>
<p>After we typeset stories the editors check it for &ldquo;bad breaks&rdquo;. I thought this was a ridiculous waste of time since we had a Canadian dictionary within the progam that we could apply to our documents. The &ldquo;bad breaks&rdquo; occur because the auto-hyphenation of the US dictionary which we&rsquo;ve been using up until now. We want our words to break in the Canadian style.</p>
<p>My question is this:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve changed the InD dictionary preferences of all the computers in the art dept. to the Canadian dictionary. We flowed in our text and typeset it but now how it&rsquo;s hyphenating is worse than ever. It&rsquo;s breaking in very un-canadian and un-american ways. 
I can&rsquo;t figure out what I&rsquo;ve done wrong and the editors are really annoyed with me. Also, in my preferences, I have &ldquo;Merge User Dictionary&rdquo; checked off.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m in a document and go to the dictionary, it&rsquo;s default is ENG. USA  and Language: USA</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t created a new template for this issue, so I wonder if that&rsquo;s the problem?</p>
<p>Has Adobe played a cruel joke on us? Is there really no Canadian dictionary or like many others, do they just lump us in with the US figuring we&rsquo;re all the same?</p>
<p>Thanks so much for any help or any suggestions anyone can offer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to hide out in the bathroom &lsquo;til this all blows over.</p>
<p>-S</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>From my experience, and from what I hear others say, is that generally the proofing tools within InD are crap, especially the dictionary. In any language, its garbage as far as I am concerned, and I use it in english. I am forever adding word to the damn thing that should most certainly be part of its lexicon already. You may consider integrating <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/incopy/index.html">Adobe InCopy</a> into your workflow, as it seems to be something that major publications use now. Essentially, its the linking program that combines the editing capabilities of a processing application with the design capabilities of the layout program. I have never personally used this program, so I have no idea if it is worth the expense, or the hassle of teaching your department. I have heard from a few though, that it works as a great solution to link editors and copywriters with their designer counterparts.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for your help. Yes, we do use InCopy. We had the edit team switch their InCopy prefs to the Canadian dictionary as well. We have had a lot of success with InCopy and it&rsquo;s much easier to use than the Quark counterpart, QPS. Unfortunately, this dictionary thing has just blown up in our face&hellip;well, my face. I just can&rsquo;t believe I have to have someone sit beside me with a CDN Oxford dictionary to check that InDesign hyphenated words in the right place. It seems so, well, lame and a big waste of time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m angry that I trusted Adobe to get that part right of their program right.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">On a related note, there&rsquo;s a full-page ad in the Toronto Star today for MDG Computers, featuring NBA 2006 MVP Steve Nash (a Canadian). Nash has avoided the usual sponsorship opportunities and is plugging MDG, a Canadian computer manufacturer. The headline reads, 
LIGHTENING IS NOT SUPPOSE TO STRIKE TWICE. Set in Goudy Bold Caps with faux horizontal scaling and a dropshadow. You&rsquo;d think they could of use a Canadian typeface, eh?!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On another related note, from what I remember from English Classes and such, that you can really hyphenate a word anywhere, as long as you place the hyphen in between syllables, and not just arbitrairly in between two letters. For instance, the word typophile could be hyphenated as:</p>
<p>typ-ophile
typo-phile
typophi-le</p>
<p>Is this incorrect? I only ask because if this rule is kosher, then you don&rsquo;t need to sit with the OED and a editing buddy, assuming though that you can sound out your syllables.</p>
<p>P.S.- I am not familiar with Canadian, as I am English, the ones that live in America, not in England.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re right about that but there&rsquo;s often a preferred hyphenation. At the magazine we have to be extremely consistent about our style so we use the Oxford Canadian Dictionary hyphenation style. Surprisingly, what&rsquo;s recommened is often different from US style of hyphenation. Oh! It&rsquo;s all so boring!</p>
<p>On another note, we found out that people have incorrectly changed their InDesign dictionary prefs so that might be where our stupid problem lies. We&rsquo;re going to start from scratch next issue. New templates and I&rsquo;m going to change everyone&rsquo;s dictionary prefs myself. I think we&rsquo;re trailblazers on this one!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is an old thread, but has become relevant to us lately. I&rsquo;m an editor at a Canadian magazine. We&rsquo;ve just completed a redesign, and suddenly the hyphenation is terrible. It&rsquo;s not just a question of US vs. Canadian vs. UK style (they&rsquo;re all slightly different). Some of the breaks InDesign/InCopy is making aren&rsquo;t acceptable in any dictionary AFAIK. We use Canadian Oxford as our main dictionary, but we&rsquo;d be willing to use another for hyphenation if InDesign would just do so consistently.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t see how the change in body font could affect hyphenation, and our prefs haven&rsquo;t changed with the redesign, as far as we can tell. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>By the way, Track and Kern asks whether you can just break by syllable. That&rsquo;s not always true. From what I remember, US hyphenation tends to break according to the way a word is spoken and UK hyphenation tends to break according to word origin (so a break would fall right before a suffix, even if the pronounced syllable breaks elsewhere). Canadian probably falls in the middle. There are other subtleties that some publications follow, such as not breaking on so-called &ldquo;liquid ells,&rdquo; a final syllable ending (usually) in &ldquo;le.&rdquo; We avoid breaking bub-ble, for example.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There are a number of bugs that pop up with adding a user dictionary to the stock ID dictionary, with both both CS2 and CS3. We&rsquo;ve reported this to Adobe, they have acknowledged it, and it <em>may</em> change in future releases. We go through bloody hell to use a custom dictionary, and vigilance is required to make sure the correct dictionary is in play with each job.</p>
<p>As to the hyphenation of &ldquo;typophile&rdquo;:</p>
<p>The usual practice, in the States anyway, is that single vowels stay up. The proper hyphenation is typo-phile.</p>
<p>You will find some of those who don&rsquo;t break before a liquid ell (good idea) extending the notion, so that bubbling is not breakable. I&rsquo;ve always felt that bub-bling is OK, bub-ble is not.</p>
<p>Remember that disallowing hyphen points always involves a compromise: word spacing will be more uneven.</p>
