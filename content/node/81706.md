  body: "Judging from the awkward M vertex I am guessing that the original was drawn
    with a ruler by someone who wasn't a type artist. I searched sans Serif fonts
    from the sixties and found nothing similar in terms of the structure of the M.\r\n\r\nIn
    spite of that analysis, I have a nagging feeling that I have seen a sans with
    a strange M like this, but I can't find it. Maybe Mark Simonson or another of
    our type veterans might recognize this?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
