  9 collumns/12 rows with a gutter\r\nof 0.0625 vertically and horizontally. I would
  like to change\r\nmy gutter to 0.1667 in having the text justified with last line
  aligned left.\r\nIt sounds like a mouthfull I know. attached is a screenshot to
  illustrate my\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grid_5899.jpg]"

  body: "I would argue that you need to do whatever makes reading the text easier
    for the reader(s)... Also, you are making two changes at the same time: going
    from ragged right to justified <em>and</em> increasing the width of the gutter...\r\n\r\nWith
    justified text there is the risk of having rivers of white space (due to unequal
    wordspaces), but it will give you less lines of text overall."
