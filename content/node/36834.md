body: "I never really see anyone here mention Harold Lohner. He has offered many free
  and $5 fonts which, some are quite nice. Besides my love for Sarah Script from Charles
  Borges de Oliveira, I have also been infatuated with Imitation from Harold. I just
  enjoy the face. If I ever did a poster about Paris in the early 1900s - that font
  would be perfect.\r\n\r\nI received an email about Harold Lohner's art show, <em>Wheel
  of Life</em>- and I thought I'd share it with you. (You've probably received it
  as well, and if not - here goes.)\r\n\r\nSubject: September News from Harold\u2019s
  Fonts + Art Opening\r\n\r\nSeptember News from Harold\u2019s Fonts + Art Opening\r\n\r\nhttp://www.haroldsfonts.com\r\n\r\nBack
  to school, back to font-making...\r\n\r\nBut first I wanted to tell you about an
  opening this Friday. I\u2019m doing a outdoor projection piece on the Opalka Gallery
  at Sage College of Albany, where I teach. \u201CWheel of Life\u201D is a cycle of
  portrait drawings I made using a scanner. Here\u2019s the invitation; please check
  it out. http://www.haroldsfonts.com/wheeloflife.pdf\r\n\r\nThe new font this month
  is SWEET SPIRIT, an intricate design that\u2019s a cousin to my popular Graceful
  Ghost. Drawn with long flowing lines and adapted from a historical source, perfect
  for suggesting embroidery or engraving. Now available from Font Bros.\r\n\r\nAnd
  thank you for the positive response to my new arrangement with Font Bros. It\u2019s
  getting me a wider audience for my work. I appreciate those who\u2019ve followed
  and supported my work for almost 10 years now. So many have asked that I provide
  easier shopping or encouraged me to charge more for commercial fonts. And I\u2019m
  happy to be able to continue to offer free and $5 fonts as well.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nHarold
  Lohner\r\nhttp://www.haroldsfonts.com"

  body: I agree that Harold's work is under-appreciated. I knew Harold when I lived
    and worked in Troy, New York. He's a wonderful person, a fantastic printmaker,
    and an excellent curator as well.

    Bros</a>. He does have some fun display typefaces, that is for sure. I think my
    favorite is Ben's Gothic, with Graceful Ghost following.

    de Sousa</strong>, Mrs Tiffany? \r\nSurely this cannot be considered a non-typographical
    event? Or have I missed out completely (most likely...)?"

  body: "Thanks for sharing Jackie. I love Harold's work too; I've enjoyed a friendship
    with him by correspondence since 2003. Some time in the first half of 2008 I plan
    to publish an interview with Harold about his font work, since he is so underappreciated.
    Hoping to reverse that I will post a news release here at Typophile and on Fontlover.com
    when the interview goes online. It will be the third installment in my \"A conversation
    with...\" series.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
