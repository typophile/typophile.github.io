  Helvetica, people have been trying to show how Type-smart they are and use the superbly
  designed geometric Avenir instead of Helvetica. And now it's overused.\r\n\r\nLike
  the good song thats played over and over and over on the radio until you hate it.
  Poor Avenir. I did love you."

  body: Maybe it's that we're seeing a lot of both Gotham and Avenir, and since their
    lower cases are fairly similar at first glance it seems like we're seeing more
    of both of them than we really are.

    Helvetica, on the other hand, is still king of over-exposure.

    no escape from the Obama look!"

    \r\n\r\nGotham is very rarely used in a way that looks pleasant to me... I like
    the way it looks in Good Food Magazine and that\u2019s probably it.\r\n\r\nPTL
    Speech looks like a nice alternative to Avenir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Avenir is an excellent font and so is Myriad, however I prefer most if not
    all of Adrian Frutiger fonts.\r\nI see allot of Helvetica usage these day's, it's
    so overused.  However it remains as one of the top fonts no matter how much it's
    been used.  Gotham is also great, however it is not as over used as the fonts
    mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuerrizmo[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nochance_5279.jpg]"
