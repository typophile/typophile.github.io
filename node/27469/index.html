<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Here is the scoop. I am in the process of aquiring (free mind you) a Smith Hoe Acorn press
http://users.bestweb.net/~bpress/briarpress/museum/2ironhand/smithcin/smithcin-m.jpg
it was owned by Parsons School of Design for years, until my great uncle, who was director of design there retired and they gave it to him. He tried sending donating it but i think for some reason was unable to.
Question being...does any know the value of these presses? or the rarity?
it is located on Staten Island and I'd have to move it, which would be pretty intense figuring its made of iron, and I live in Cincinnati.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

<div class=commentbody>Ahhhh, letterpress. Love it.
I am no expert in valueing stuff like this but I can probably assure you that it is worth quite a lot of money. It is a dying trade, and unfortunalty the equipment needed to produce such beautiful pieces of print is also dying out and is very hard to come by. I am from England and I am always on the look oout for places that hold these machines for public use. Its usually a case of sweet talking a university.
I have never bought one but I have bought a few book presses. Not of the size you are looking at with your letter press, in fact only a4 size and just under, and these I can say set me back a small fortune.
If you find the right collector then you could probably get quite a good price, but why would anyone want to part with a piece of history like this. Unless of course it doesnt fit in the appartment :)

<div class=commentbody>Follow the thread over here - http://www.briarpress.org/briarpress/discuss/viewtopic.php?pid=726
Also looks like these guys have one - http://www.museumofprinting.org/Collection.html - if you're going to Typecon you could ask the curators to do an antiques-roadshow style estimate for you. My guess is that you won't get much for it, as it will cost whoever takes possesion of it $000's to transport it you may end up paying them to take it away ;-)

Congratulations on your getting a Stanhope. They are one of the prettier of the handpresses. My next favourite is the Clymer Columbian. You know the one; all serpants and eagles on the counterwights.
I can't say exactly what the price would be on the press, because I don't know what size the platen is. As an example a smaller one: 13x16-1/2 platen could sell for anything between $3000 and $5500, depending on how mych value the seller puts on it. Anything in that spread would be a reasonable price to pay.

<div class=commentbody>Thank you everyone!
That actually was my post over at the briar site.
I have been told that the platen size is 17x24 (i think...not positive, I'm gonna measure it when I go to take photos of it though.) Anyone have any ideas of how i could move it from NYC (practically) to Cincinnati?</div>

<div class=commentbody>If you move it yourslef, a pickup should do. Whether you move it yourself or have with a freight company it is best to go to where the press is stroed and take it apart. An iron handpresses whatever type is fragile. The cast iron is old and brittle and easily broken. Any of these type of presses in their assempled state are very vulnerable since the boss and bed are heavy and the legs very delicate. I have moved one press twice. On the second move the press was the property of a buyer and they didn't break it down. The movers smashed it up badly before it even left my driveway.
I would place it on two pallets: one for the heavy bed and boss and another for the legs, ways etc. It is bests to carry the miscellaneous nuts and bolts away with you in a separate container. If any of these things are lost it is nearly impossible to replace them since the threads in most cases are of an odd count and specific to the maker.
I hope this doesn't put you off, but it's best to be aware of the pitfalls.
Best of good luck in your move.

<div class=commentbody>A bit of more news concerning the press. The platen is 17x22 which i have been informed is a somewhat rare size, being that most of the Smith Hoe Acorns still around are 22x30 or somewhere around there. I have more photos of it here http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v180/becker513/Letterpress/
if anyone is interested, or could help me determine an approximate value, that would be amazing. Thank you.

The acorns are a bit of a rarity. They don't have the production reputation of an Albion but ...
I sold my 12 by 18 Albion for $5,000. It was likely worth near $6,000. That is at least what this press is worth.
