body: "this is bugging me\r\n\r\nis there an easy way to find out where the fonts
  on this site are being served from? the body text on \r\nhttp://www.rd.com/health/sleep-your-way-to-better-heart-health/\r\n\r\nis
  reported by the 'what font' tool as PoynterOSTextTwoL, which I thought might come
  from WebType, but it doesnt seem to. the hinting is weird, see the bottom of the
  lowercase p decender. \r\n\r\nany help appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, by a look into the code. The CSS reveals that Reader\u2019s Digest doesn\u2019t
    use a webfont servive, but rather hosts the fonts itself. They link to raw OpenType
    fonts (several styles of Poynter OS, as well as Freight Sans and Micro), using
    @font-face, without any obfuscation whatsoever. I doubt this is in accordance
    with the EULAs. I will point the respective foundries to this thread."
