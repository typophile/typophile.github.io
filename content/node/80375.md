body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/namethattype_4945.jpg]\r\nI would love
  some help on this one. It looks like a humanist Sans serif.\r\nIt bears a striking
  resemblance to Tahoma, Verdana, Franklin Gothic Demi, and Lucidia Sans.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is that it is neither. I get close to knowing what it is, but its that ear
  on the lower case G that throws me off.\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help, it would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    appears to be, in fact, Tahoma Bold, but the bottom one most definitely is not.'

    lesser known typeface in the sub heading?\r\n\r\nEither way, I'll manage.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help."

    The subline is clearly not Calibri. \r\n\r\nIt would help probably to know which
    magazine this is from. "

  body: If this, as I suspect, comes from a scan of a Spin Magazine article, then
    it may be a custom typeface created by [[http://www.typography.com/|Hoefler &
    Frere-Jones]], whose [[http://www.typography.com/about/clients.php|client list]]
    includes Spin.
