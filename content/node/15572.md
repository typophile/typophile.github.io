  body: "I'll just point to a few typefaces I have used, and can therefore recommend.
    I only consider OpenType fonts, for reasons other people have explained much better
    than I could; but I'd add that when it comes to non-Latin you'd be a fool to not
    use Unicode-encoded fonts. \r\n\r\nAdobe Minion Pro and Myriad Pro are as good
    in their Greeks as they are in their Latins; ditto Warnock Pro, for a different
    kind of documents. More interesting (and for an entirely different category of
    documents) Garamond Premiere Pro -- also, the only truly complete character set
    in the stable, with full polytonic and small caps.  \r\n\r\nHelvetica Linotype
    is a cut above its siblings, if you're looking in that direction.\r\n \r\nVictor
    Gaultney's Gentium supports polytonic Greek (and is free).\r\n\r\nThere's also
    a small operation in Seattle with some very good -- albeit monotonic -- Greeks
    under its belt, but I haven't seen the fonts retail yet; my guess is they'll end
    up bundled with some piece of software or other. \r\n"
