  nano (PRODUCT) RED Special Edition</A>  \r\n\r\nSeems a bit of a mouthful, no? Not
  really in keeping with snappy Apple product names from the past... Cube, Newton,
  iMac etc., and all-caps, punctuation and mixing sans-serifs? Okay, <A HREF=\"http://www.joinred.com/\">good-cause</A>,
  co-branding, whatever, just seems a bit out of place, amongst the Myriad ;-) of
  other Apple product names.\r\n\r\nHow about ( iPod ) <SUP>RED</SUP> ?\r\n\r\nCheers,
  Si \r\n\r\n"

    Olins did the branding</a> for '(PRODUCT)RED\u2122', so, yea, every product and
    initiative related to that will be branded (rather) similar. The new iPod nano
    is only one small part of all that. The funny thing is, if I got that right, it
    actually should be '(iPod)RED', or even '(IPODNANO)RED\u2122', like you suggested,
    Si. :) A typophile edition, related to '(PRODUCT)RED\u2122', would then be named
    '(Typophile)RED\u2122' or '(TYPOPHILE)RED\u2122'. :)\r\n\r\nDav\r\n\r\n<em>Not
    '(Dav)RED\u2122', yet.</em>"

    too. www.gap.org\r\n\r\nIt's a nice touch that carrying this thing around (and
    I like the color a lot) broadcasts your philanthropy but is much subtler than
    type on a t-shirt. "
