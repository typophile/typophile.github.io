  <BR> <BR>At first I thought it was Thesis TheSerif, but on closer inspection the
  serifs appear to be different. This sample is from the Australian &#39;Donna Hay

  <BR>Any help would be most appreciated... <BR>Thank you! <BR> <BR>Helen'

  body: ' Thanks Stephen, extremely helpful as always.  <BR> <BR>I have another question
    though: which of these fonts &#40;PMN Caecilia or Thesis TheSerif&#41; came first?
    They seem pretty similar in design &#40;or is it just me...?&#41; '

  body: PMN Caecilia by Peter Matthias Noordzij &#40;released by Adobe in 1991&#41;
    predates Luc&#40;as de Groot&#39;s Thesis by some 3 years &#40;originally released
    under the FontFont banner in 1994&#41;, but the production of Thesis started in
    1989, so it&#39;s quite possible they were developped almost simultaneously. <BR>
    <BR>The fact they seem pretty similar is because they&#39;re both by very talented,
    very Dutch ;&#41; type designers who are about the same age and studied at the
    same school, the Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten in The Hague, with
    the same tutor, Gerrit Noordzij, who is Peter-Matthias&#39; father. And both typefaces
    were designed according to the same principle of the broad-nibbed pen. <BR> <BR>You
    can find more info about the genesis of Thesis at <A HREF="http://www.lucasfonts.com/"
    TARGET="_blank"> Lucasfonts</A>  &#62; The LF Font Families &#62; Thesis Classic
    &#62; Info &amp; Samples. The most interesting part of the creation, it&#39;s
    original design under the name Parenthesis as the &#34;corporate&#34; typeface
    for the ministerie van Verkeer en Waterstaat, is not included anymore, sadly enough.

  body: I couldn&#39;t find them neither. The Linotype site just mentions them, but
    that&#39;s all I guess. I&#39;ve always been a sucker for proto-versions of types
    too. I really like what <A HREF="http://www.typotheque.com/pages/progress.html"
