body: "HSDA is the first Hekma School of Design and Architecture in the Kingdom, which
  is under Dar Al-Hekma College. Our programs span a range of disciplines including;
  Foundation Year, Architecture, Fashion Design, Graphic Design, and Interior Design,
  with more to come.\r\n\r\nThe HSDA: Annual Design Symposium\u2019s aims are:\r\n1.
  raising the awareness of the local design communication to the development in the
  design world\r\n2. creating a platform for communication between the new local design
  generation and well known designers from different parts of the globe. This platform
  is also an opportunity for local designers to network with other local designers.\r\n3.
  developing visual communication standards for the local market\r\n\r\n\r\nRead The
  Fine Print - Manifesto\r\n\r\nThe fine print is fine. It is tiny. It is not always
  noticeable. It is at the base. It is unavoidable. It is controversial. This fine
  print often says the opposite of what the larger print says. We as designers sketch,
  illustrate, arrange and compose the fine print in our designs as well.\r\n \r\nThe
  theme of HSDA: Annual Design Symposium \u2013 \u201C*Read The Fine Print\u201D is
  an opportunity to actually practice this. It focuses on the importance of detailing
  in all fields of design; by carefully, thoughtfully and creativity integrating the
  details into the design itself. Before signing or agreeing to something, we read
  through the contract, right? Likewise before the design is presented to the client
  and/or sent to print or build or execusion, it is important that it is examined
  to the very last detail. Attention to the details is absolutely necessary in order
  to avoid any disaster. \r\n\r\nThe fine details have an immense potential that can
  determine the success of any piece of work. In fact it is the small print that actually
  holds a big promise. Always *Read the fine print.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuest Speakers are:\r\n1.\tAhmed
