    proven absolutely. What &#42;is&#42; absolutely certain is that they were not
    produced on the IBM Selectric Composer or the IBM Executive, the two machines
    most often touted as possibly producing the documents. I have done experiments
    that prove this beyond any reasonable doubt &#40;while simultaneously supporting
    but not proving forgery&#41;. <BR> <BR>See this morning&#39;s Washington Post:
    <BR>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18982-2004Sep13.html <BR> <BR>
    <BR>Clarifications I sorted through last night to my bit of the article: <BR>
    <BR>1&#41; Adobe did the digital version of Times Roman from which the Microsoft/Monotype
    Times New Roman borrowed its widths to use with the Monotype design. Adobe got
    said widths from Linotype. I did mention the various other players, but what can
    you expect when an entire interview is boiled down to a couple of sentences? <BR>
    <BR>2&#41; Although certainly a run-of-the-mill Selectric could not have produced
    the memo, more importantly I eliminated the IBM &#34;Selectric Composer&#34; &#40;often
    just called an &#34;IBM Composer&#34;&#41;. This was an actual typesetting device
    based on typewriter-like technology, which has frequently been touted as the likely
    source of the memos. <BR> <BR>3&#41; The IBM machines used fonts of different
    widths than the font used for the memos. The font used for the memos is a perfect
    match for Times. The IBM machines were not capable of producing a perfect match
    to those widths. Times is based on a system of widths of 5-17 units &#40;at 18-to-the-em&#41;.
    The Composer uses a system of 3-9 units, and the Executive a system of 2-5 units.
    <BR> <BR>4&#41; The reporter didn&#39;t tell me of Glennon&#39;s statement, so
    it&#39;s funny to say that I disputed it. Indeed, I won&#39;t dispute that the
    IBM machines could produce results &#34;similar&#34; to the disputed memos. But
    they cannot reproduce the exact relative line lengths, which is what I measured.
    Can they do something &#34;similar&#34;? Sure. Could they produce those actual
    memos? Impossible. <BR> <BR>5&#41; Of course Adobe&#39;s HQ is in San Jose. I
    am at our Seattle offices. <BR> <BR>6&#41; I&#39;ve done this solely on my own
    time. Adobe as a company takes no position on the memos &#40;or the election&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s about it for now. Here&#39;s the first visual aid I produced
    &#40;attached&#41;, along with the original memo for comparison. <BR> <BR>Cheers,

    has introduced distortions. Also that some of the glyph proportions, such as the

    affected by the repeated copying? What is your view on the issue of the proportions.

    friend Jules Siegel first shot at showing the &#34;visual aid.&#34; I&#39;ll post
    it within another day or so after they&#39;ve had their chance. <BR> <BR>2&#41;
    No, all I care is when the lines end, what letter is above/below what. The cumulative
    effect of the advance widths. This is practically immune to the issues of distortion
    from repeated copying. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s possible that the font is something other
    than Times or Times New Roman. If so, it exactly matches the advance widths of
    Times/TNR, and it&#39;s an interesting coincidence that virtually all the letterforms
    are close enough that differences could be attributed to degradation from repeated
    scanning/copying &#40;like being faxed, then being scanned and having the scan
    dropped to ~120 dpi&#41;. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the short version of my analysis:
    <BR> <BR>SUMMARY <BR> <BR>The incredibly bad reproduction of the memos makes it
    hard to state many things definitively. But one thing that is not degraded by
    the reproduction is the simple question of relative line lengths. Where does each
    line end, relative to the lines above and below it? <BR> <BR>Given proportionally
    spaced fonts, and a large enough sample &#40;as these four memos are&#41;, these
    line breakings offer a sort of digital fingerprint of the widths of the font used.
    The memos precisely match current digital versions of Times &#40;and previous
    phototype and hot metal typesetting versions&#41;, but they do not match the IBM
    Composer fonts &#40;1&#41;, or do they match any version of the IBM Executive
    &#40;2&#41;. <BR> <BR>DETAIL: <BR> <BR>This is not overly surprising, since the
    number of possible character widths was much more limited for the Composer &#40;all
    characters were 3-9 units wide&#41; and the Executive &#40;all characters were
    2-5 or perhaps 2-6 units wide&#41;. <BR> <BR>It is worth noting that the digital
    versions of Times available today are all based on an earlier 18-units-relative-to-height
    &#40;&#34;to the em&#34; in font-geek-speak&#41; system, with common characters
    being 5-17 units wide. So while they have relatively discrete widths for common
    characters, these widths are at a &#34;finer grain&#34; than early typewriters
    or low-end typesetters of the 70s such as the Executive and the Composer. <BR>
    <BR>Today&#39;s digital versions of Times have widths that descend from those
    used in Linotype&#39;s phototypesetting and earlier hot metal versions. Monotype
    had previously had a &#40;more original&#41; version with different widths, but
    when Microsoft licensed Monotype&#39;s version, they wanted it to be compatible
    with Adobe&#39;s, so the widths were changed to match the Adobe/Lino versions.
    Thus all the main digital versions of Times used today have the same widths. <BR>
    <BR>&#40;1&#41; The IBM Composer proportional fonts all had the same relative
    character widths, regardless of font design. Thus there is in essence only one
    &#34;fingerprint&#34; for the Composer fonts. Times matches the memo fingerprint,
    but not the Composer fingerprint. <BR>   Contrariwise, I made a digital version
    of a Composer font &#40;since I have the widths info&#41;. This allowed me to
    do &#34;virtual Composer&#34; simulations and prove in the reverse direction,
    that the relative line lengths set with the virtual Composer are quite different.
    &#40;Note: My Composer simulation font was accurate to the nearest 1/1000 of the
    point size for each letter.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41; The IBM Executive did not
    offer switchable fonts, so you literally had to buy a different typewriter to
    get a different proportional font. None of them is particularly close to Times.

  body: 'I&#39;m glad to see someone articulately describe the line length argument.
    This was one of the first things that stood out to me. Obviously, the letterforms
    themselves are mangled beyond recognition, but the cumulative effect of the metrics
    is much more apparent. Even the slightest differences in character widths when
    multiplied by hundreds of characters will affect copy flow. Ask any middle schooler
    who has typed a paper: choose the right font, and a nine page paper becomes ten--and
    for the most part, your teachers will still think any serif font is Times New
    Roman &#40;along with most of the members of the press&#41;. Obviously the the
    differences here are more subtle, but the principle is the same. It&#39;s really
    tricky to match copy flow exactly without the exact type, because the metrics
    will vary slightly, even from vendor to vendor for a particular face. Some notable
    exceptions are &#34;parasitic&#34; fonts specifically designed to replicate metrics,
    such as Arial, allowing for substitution without changing copy flow. <BR> <BR>I
    still had some doubts about the forgeries with all of the old Selectric Composer
    guys coming out saying &#34;typewriters could do anything computers can as early
    as 1492&#34;, but my suspicions were confirmed when I started to see accurate
    descriptions of Composer metrics. I commented on this over at Typographica. &#40;By

    discussed in every news venue?&#41; <BR> <BR>Tangent: Didn&#39;t Adobe do some

    at all.&#41; It&#39;s perfectly clear that Bush avoided combat and got preferential
    treatment, but it doesn&#39;t make a whit of difference compared to things that
    matter. The real issues are economy, environment, health care, terrorism, war,
    energy, corruption, equality, civil liberties, etc., not what these guys were
    doing more than 30 years ago. There has been a terrible decline in the quality
    of journalism, and what passes for news and commentary these days is a joke and
    a scandal.

    it&#39;s kinda fun to see typography making front page headlines. <BR> <BR>The

  body: 'You can download the PDF of the document from the IMRL, and that works fine.
    <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, Hailey&#39;s artice reflects a poor understanding of fonts.
    He identifies the font as one dating to 1905 called &#34;Typewriter,&#34; and
    then shows an example--of a monospaced font! It&#39;s not &#34;the same&#34; font
    if it has been adapted to proportional spacing and the letter widths have been
    dramatically altered. Hailey dismisses my arguments with attacks on my starting
    with Times New Roman--but admits he isn&#39;t an expert on widths, and indeed
    it&#39;s apparent to me that he doesn&#39;t understand my argument. He makes arguments
    about how certain kinds of inconsistencies couldn&#39;t possibly be caused by
    scanning degradation--but obviously he didn&#39;t run the right kinds of tests,
    because when I ran tests using Times and involving faxing, then scanning back
    in, using the resolutions in the posted CBS docs, I got results that looked very
    much like the CBS docs, including things like the cupped serifs. <BR> <BR>Finally,
    his close matches to the actual memos were achieved by taking his &#40;unclear
    what version, unclear on what basis he chose widths&#41; typewriter font and condensing
    it &#40;unclear what method&#41;. Guess what: proportional-spacing typewriters
    in 1972 didn&#39;t have a special button for &#34;Condensed&#34; like you can
    do in Word. He&#39;d have to find an actual font that matches, not invent one
    from whole cloth. <BR> <BR>Gotta run, must do some real work. <BR> <BR>T'

  body: Actually, to be fair to Hailey, it&#39;s not at all clear that he has read
    a full version of my analysis, or even that it was my analysis in particular that
    he was criticizing. If he&#39;s just going by what he read in the Washington Post,
    then he doesn&#39;t have a very detailed analysis to respond to--by anybody. <BR>
    <BR>That being said, his belief that &#40;for example&#41; the &#34;t&#34; shows
    considerable wear is based on it initially matching his typewriter font. The supposed
    &#34;wear&#34; alters it so it looks remarkably like... the &#34;t&#34; in Times.
    It&#39;s a much simpler explanation. <BR> <BR>All that being said, the best defense
    anybody has mounted so far is the possibility that these documents were reproductions,
    created by the TexANG&#39;s own scanning and OCR of the records, then printing
    out again. Of course, it would require considerable manual intervention to do
    that and retain signatures that overlap the text. And no other records that have
    been produced match the dubious records in terms of the font used. <BR> <BR>Cheers,
