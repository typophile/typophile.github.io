body: "I'm working on revising a menu layout for a chain restaurant, (family-friendly,
  mostly ribs and steaks, mid-range pricing).\r\n\r\nThe typeface in use in Helvetica...
  lovely for may applications, but I fear not for this one.\r\nI'm looking for any
  suggestions out there as to a typeface with high-legibililty at a relatively small
  size, preferably sans serif.\r\n\r\nAll suggestions are welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks to
  all who can help :)"

    is a bit small for small point sizes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
