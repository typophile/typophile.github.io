  of the Flemish poster campaign for the current European and regional elections,
  <em><a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=384\">The typography of politics</a>.</em>\r\n\r\nTo
  my surprise I learned yesterday that this post has made its way -- via the Facebook
  profile of Geert Lambert, head of the SLP party -- to www.deredactie.be, the news
  site of the Belgian national television. Their translation is dodgy and they misunderstood
  some details, but it still nice to see a focus on typography in the mainstream press.

    picking up the story on his Facebook page. Just to clarify\u2026 ;)"

    requested the text (dunno what they will do with it). What\u2019s next?"
