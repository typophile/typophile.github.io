  with the swirly thing on the front of the card? Also, do you know what the regular
  nonscript font on the return address?  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.suzannamarchphotography.com/weddings/giveaway-from-little-black-press/\r\n\r\nWhere
  can i buy these fonts?  \r\n\r\nI also recently bought the burgues script font and
  was wondering if anyone can suggest a nonscript font that would go well with it?
  \r\n\r\ni am trying to design my own invitations, place card, menus, etc., however,
  it's my first time so any help/suggestions would greatly be appreciated.  \r\n\r\nThanks
  a bunch,\r\n\r\nKate  "
