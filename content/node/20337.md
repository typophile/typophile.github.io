  the illlustration, whether it's implied meaning (commercialization/exploitation)

  a few seconds were, the illustration was repeating itself multiple times over, given

    ways, depending on how optimistic you want to be about the intellectual depth
    of it.  i liked it, i think, because it wasn't about che at all but rather a juxtaposition
    of mostly meaningless symbols -- though symbols that people continually adopt
    as an expression of their values.  \r\n\r\nthat said, the symbols used were the
    'obvious' ones. maybe they're trying to attract attention from the adbusters crowd.\r\n\r\nthe

    sitting on pile of fashionable corpse's, eating McDonalds, drinking Pepsi whilst

  body: "Without having read the article, the image suggests shifting trends in the
    use of graphic design, exposing an ideological clash between Cuba's political
    past and their impending future in the global marketplace. It's not about a Cuban
    relationship to Apple, or Nike per se, but the effects of consumerism as a whole
    on the present design culture. Using multiple corporate elements helps convey
    this meaning (if you accept that Apple and Nike represent consumerism as a whole).
    I dont think I would've made that connection as swiftly had it been just an image
    of Che without the other symbols.\r\n\r\nI think your point about the treatment
    needing to be subdued or blown to the extreme is a good one. This piece falls
    somewhere in the middle, which is why it feels pass\xE9. "

    Your comments about Grumpy I will fail to be censorious about. It appears that
    Grummpy has no pond, location or a valid identity. So as far as I am concerned
    he has no valid point of view either. Paul, what''s the policy on typophile? I
    thought that you couldn''t anonymous like Grumps. Can we just toss him overboard? '

    reflected the truth about the perception people tend to have. The Beatles, for
    example, as many people in the 1960s and 1970s, developed a fascination for eastern
    spirituality, which rarely led them to deepen their search. This is probably true

    there is very little about cuban graphic design or commercial exploitation ( which
    would lead to a discuss the relationships between cover and content". That's funny
    that Rodriguez was ticked about it too.  The author is a former head of ICONGRADA,
    how does CA handle that???

  body: "Hi everyone,\r\nThis is the guy responsible for all this trouble!  I was
    looking around to see if anyone thought anything of my CA cover and landed here.
    \ Glad it started up some discussion, it's great when a simple piece of art can
    do that these days I think.\r\n\r\nLet me put out some info that might help understand
    the image a bit.\r\n\r\nCA was doing a feature on the last ten years of my illustration
    work.  I do a lot of work for The New Yorker, TIME, Rolling Stone, etc.  I'm also
    an art director.  I found out they were also doing a story on Cuban design in
    the same issue so I sent this image for them to consider for the cover and they
    loved it.  Probably because they thought it would start some conversation such
    as this.\r\n\r\nHow I came up with such brilliance!:  \r\nWell, I know it's not
    freakin' rocket science here, but it did make me chuckle.\r\nI was born in Cuba
    in 1971, grew up in the \"Revolution\", lucky me.  Anyways, I must have drawn
    this image of Che about a hundred times when I lived in Cuba, starting around
    age 3.  It's everywhere, so it's what I drew, along with tanks, guns, and missiles,
    cause that's what was on t.v. there.  American kids draw superheroes and cartoons
    instead.  Che was my Mickey Mouse.\r\n\r\nI figured after all this time, I could
    do one more drawing of Che, kind of coming full circle after having left Cuba
    and \"making it\" in Capitalist U.S.  I thought maybe I had some license to mess
    with the image since it has so much to do with my biography.  A lot of this was
    lost on people that don't know me I guess.  But if one where to read the story
    inside you would have learned a lot about my background which helps put the image
    in some context.  \r\n\r\nHow I came up with the idea:  \r\nMy family that is
    still in Cuba just got access to the internet, e-mail, etc.  They are just learning
    about these i-pods, tech gear, brands, etc.  So I've started gettting e-mails
    from them requesting things like memory sticks, i-pods, things with brand names,
    etc.  Years ago I would get letters from them asking for medicine or food.  So,
    the idea that Cuba is slowly changing into a capitalist society is what came of
    this communication with my family back on the island.  And this image was the
    result.  \r\n\r\nAnother thing that has bugged me over the years is all these
    people with Che t-shirts and the whole Che cult.  People that have no clue what
    a cold blooded killer Che was and how many people's lives were ruined by the Cuban
    revolution (Not well to do folks, but artists, musicians, poets, homosexuals,
    or anyone that had individual ideas and expressed them.)\r\n\r\nSo,  people here
    in the U.S. that are all underground and hipster and \"original\" with the Che
    gear and that all wear the same brands and listen to their i-pods annoy me.  They
    try to act all rebel and counterculture but they're all fitting in in their own
    way.  I think this image worked for me as a criticism of such an attitude as well.\r\n\r\nI
    am very well aware that doing anything with \"Che\" is the biggest cli-\"Che\"
    ever.  I went ahead with it because I figured it would tick off some people and,
    if anyone knew me, they would realize that I just like to do that sometimes.  I
    feel some designers, artists, etc.  put up these rules, \"oh you can't do that,
    gotta do it this way, must be super original always\", it's a very American, western
    way to look at things.  It's not the way I grew up making imagery, we take one
    thing, do something to it, do something to it again.  Go to any country in Latin
    America and you'll see this kind of stuff, artists commenting on culture, on each
    other, a dialogue, which I think doesn't happen in the U.S. as much.\r\n\r\nWell,
    that's it for now.  I'm not much of a chat room person but I registered here,
    I'll check back and answer any questions you guys have.  It's great to talk about
    art, design, type, very smart stuff.  Not so crazy when the thing goes off the
    topic.\r\n\r\nOh, and the machine gun cat is just freakin' awesome.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for all the comments.\r\n\r\nEdel"

      can see from my work inside the magazine, the cover is not necessarily typical
      of what I do.  It was me taking another road and commenting a bit.  Inside there
      is something similar I guess, Mao in an Yves Saint Laurent tunic for a story
      on the New China for TIME magazine.  Most of my work are portraits and musicians
      or theater drawings, plus some conceptual stuff.\r\n\r\nWhere I kind of wondered
      if you were a student or just \"out of school\" is when you mentioned in the

    your perspective on things besides your cover too.\r\n\r\nEric, I think the audience
    of CA mostly needs and is interested in graphic messages that are 'powerful' (
    bludeoning). CA is about mass communication! I can't blame them. And your idea
    strikes me as too subtle. Also, it assumes that the audience reads the 'Che' part
    of the image in the same way you do. So yes, I think you are off base. Sorry.
    Just my idea about it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I don't think the meaning of the
    cover is clear or precise despite it's strength. It can be read too many ways.
    That's not important to CA because it's a funny image & works with their theme
    so what it means precisely isn't important. It's strong! It's graphic! And sometimes
    having an image that can be read many ways is a good thing. It maintains it interest
    longer. Especially if it's that worn out Che again.\r\n\r\nRegarding the meaning
    of the cover: Edel's explanation make 100% sense. However if you or I read the
    image a different way then that's valid too. \r\n\r\nTo me it just looks like
    an homage to strange power of brands. \r\n\r\nRE: Not so crazy when the thing
    goes off the topic.\r\n\r\nWhere was that in your opinion?  I still don't have
    the slightest idea where you would draw that line. Drawing the line at abuse is
    one thing ( It sounds like there has been some & thats bad ) but right now we
    have no working definition of a 'topic'. I am not clear getting one is a good

    me try to answer some things here.  Not a chat room pro so bear with me.  I'll
    start from the last post.\r\n\r\nNo, I didn't have the image stashed somewhere.
    \ I actually haven't done anything with the straight Che image since I was a kid.
    \ This is why I thought, for a biographical story about me, my work, and another
    on Cuban design in the same issue, this image made sense.  I have drawn Che posters
    in the background of drawings I did when I've traveled to Cuba to visit family,
    etc.  Some of those have been published.\r\n\r\nI think some of the problem is
    that people see the image on the site here and may not realize that it's meant
    to be seen, as Eric first saw it, at the Newsstand at Barnes and Noble or Borders
    or at a library.  Or in your mailbox if you subscribe to CA.  You look at it,
    makes you wonder what it's about, you look inside for a credit or info, and you
    might go ahead and read the inside stuff.\r\n\r\nI think part of the problem is
    that the original question assumes that this image was done for a bunch of type
    and design geeks like ourselves that spend the weekend on a chatroom discussing
    the intricacies of serifs.  I didn't do it for those folks alone.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you start working for magazines you realize that what the publisher wants is their
    stories to be read and their magazines to be purchased by as large an audience
    as possible.  So, I wanted Joe Schmo at the Barnes and Noble to be looking around
    and go \"hey, it's Che, and i-pod, and nike\", funny, what the hell is this, etc.
    \ \r\n\r\nI like to communicate to a lot of different people.  My dad never got
    past the sixth grade but there's nothing like the feeling when I show him something
    and he gets it, laughs, asks questions, etc.  This is who the world is made up
    of, not type geeks.  If if works for them too, then great, but I'm not going to
    shelf an image because the art police might come after me.\r\n\r\nAbout Fredo's
    comment:  I don't think you need my life story to \"get it\".  I've had plenty
    of people e-mail or have a reaction without knowing much about me.  And there
    was a lot of talk about it here before I came into the picture.  I thought my
    info would just help people learn more about it.  \r\n\r\nI tried to give some
    info for anyone that looked at the magazine.  On the contents page there is a
    title, caption and credit.  It reads:\r\n\r\nCover: \"Brand CACh\xE9\".  \"A wired
    Cuban generation seeks the status of our logo culture as we seek the rebel status
    of theirs\"\r\n\r\nWith those few chosen words I tried to describe a couple of
    ways that the image can be read, which was my intent, for it to be read in several
    ways.  I guess some people have trouble with that.  My background is in Painting
    and fine art so reading something 100 ways is what I was taught to do.\r\n\r\nOne
    person that seems to be on the money on a lot of this is Eben Sorkin:\r\n\r\nHe
    says \"To me it just looks like an homage to strange power of brands.\"  Bingo,
    that's what I was after.  That's why it's called \"Brand CA-Ch\xE9\"  How they're
    all a brand, Che, i-pod, nike, even CA, and how people just get hypnotized by
    them.  Ad agencies throw around the term \"brand cache\" all the time. How to
    make your brand sing, blah, blah.  And when I go to Cuba, Che is treated the same
    way.  The one place you think would honor him has him plastered on watches, cigars,
    lighters, on and on.\r\n\r\nAnd on Eben's comment about going off topic, I meant
    the abusive stuff or things that I read 3 or 4 times and can't understand.  I
    think this is a conversation, it should go all over the place, about music, tv,
    culture.  I was just once on an illustrator's chat thing, there was a great intellectual
    subject at hand and somebody just came in and derailed the whole thing into a
    conversation about troubles he was having with his family.  So, it got me off
    the chat rooms for a while.  Rather be working instead.\r\n\r\nthanks, Edel\r\n\r\n"

      I believe a lot of your comments come from there.  I respect that, I've had
      plenty of civil conversations with communists in Cuba, some in my own family.
      \r\n\r\nI am not a right winger by far, I'm very liberal, I just think that
      there are so many apologists for communist tyrants.  Tyranny is tyranny whether
      it's right or left wing.  I know everything about what's going on in Latin America,
      don't need to check out the BBC.  I'm Latin, I watch Spanish T.V., and read
      papers, left and right, it's all well covered.  It's not being spoon fed to
      me, they present all sides, etc.  And what's going on is more dicators taking
      over, through \"democratic\" means.  Basically, Latin Americans are all freaked
      out by Bush so they're reacting to it and getting nationalistic.  Now Chavez
      wants to be president for life in Venezuela, like Castro.  I say to all leftists,
      what would you think of having Bush as president for life.  Tyranny is tyranny,
      left or right.\r\n\r\nI don't know who you think I \"listen\" to backstage.
      \ And this whole I \"made it\" thing was in \"quotes\" for a reason, it was
      tongue in cheek.  But I do believe everyone in my family who has left Cuba has
      made it.  I came by boat, my cousins have risked their lives on inner tubes
      for a week floating out at sea, some have died.  Do you think this is a casual
      thing?  It's the biggest decision we've had to make to leave our homeland, our
      grandparents, our sisters, our kids.  And why have we left?  Because it's suffocating
      to live there.  I don't see Americans or Europeans getting on rafts to float
      somewhere else.  Something must be right then.  It's called freedom and opportunity,
      something that those born in free countries just take for granted all too often.\r\n\r\nThanks
      for the insightful comments.  I look forward to treating one another with respect.

    or addressing a problem by firing against a single individual solves anything.
    It leads only to a growing resentment.\r\n\r\nSurely Edel was aiming his cover

    But what does it mean \"an homage to strange power of brands\"? If he's sure his
    criticism went through, then he succeeded. I'm not the qualified audience to understand
    this. I may know poverty as we had in Italy in the early 20th century (part of
    my grandfathers were farmers and very poor) but I barely know who Che Guevara
    was, so I think it's not essential I get this particular message.\r\n\r\nWhatever

    She then received an email from Shaun Cole, acting head of the contemporary programme

    is not relevant or appropriate\". Ms Ziff, already unhappy that the museum had
    removed much of the text accompanying and explaining the images, which has now
    been posted on the website instead, said: \"I was gobsmacked. Inviting Gerry was
    not a stunt and it never occurred to me there would be a problem.\"</cite>\r\n\r\nShe
    and Mr Adams wondered if Guevara would also have been barred, had he still been
    alive.\r\n\r\nThe explanation from the museum seemed to be that various fashion
    models had been invited to another exhibition opening at the same time, and one
    wouldn't want them bumping into the \"irrelevant\" and \"inappropriate\" Mr Adams.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile
    the museum shop will be selling copies of all the featured Che images, a Che-branded
    lip balm, a Che finger puppet, a Che chocolate cigar, a Che doll, a Che cigar
    box, Che T-shirts, Che stickers, Che neon signs and Che badges. Whether Che's

    That is why graphic design is much harder than it is given credit for (if done

    saying this I'm not even remotely implying analytical thought is, or should be

  body: "I have to say I can't remember what I \"meant\" by wearing the T-shirt. Even
    if it was an attempt to provoke, I certainly didn't and don't intend to \"communicate\"
    by wearing certain clothes.\r\n\r\nOf course people interpret T-shirts in various
    ways, whether there's text on them or not. Those interpretations are sometimes
    interesting, often manipulable, occasionally dangerous. In this case, one would
    be forgiven for thinking I was a supporter of the Cuban Revolution. I'd heard,
    probably from the Guardian, about directors of French companies being barred from
    the USA if their company supplied spare parts to Cuban x-ray machines, and that
    pissed me off. I'd also heard, probably from Michael Moore, about the Cuban health
    service being far better than the USA's, and that pissed me off too. The American
    embarrassments of the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis seemed, inexcusably,
    to explain their isolation of Cuba. So I had a few things to talk about over a
    drink if someone approached me because of the shirt. But I was also well aware
    that I wasn't being particularly daring wearing the shirt. For a start, Massachusetts
    is not Miami. And the police normally let people wear stuff like that: getting
    arrested is unlikely. The biggest risk was probably that I might be thought of
    as silly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a couple of years before TypeCon 98, I'd turned up to
    the Royal Courts of Justices on the Strand to hear Helen Steel and David Morris
    (the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLibel\">McLibel</a> two) defend
    themselves against McDonalds. I wore a shirt that said \"It's time for all honest
    citizens to turn to crime\". I rather liked the idea of the juxtaposition and
    thought I was being a bit daring. In the event... I felt like a teenage jerk and
    never wore the shirt again.\r\n\r\nDuring the \"smart sanctions\" bombing of Iraq
    (1991-2003), bearing in mind <a href=\"http://www.rejesus.co.uk/expressions/faces_jesus/gallery/che.html\">a
    Jesus-themed T-shirt of Easter 1999</a>, I told a friend I was thinking of having
    a T-shirt made up in that style but depicting Saddam Hussein instead of Che or
    Jesus. If asked, I'd perhaps have made some comment about supporting neither Saddam's
    murderous regime nor Clinton's. It could have inspired some interesting debates
    in pubs. But there would have been serious risks: my favourite caf\xE9 in Cardiff
    was run by a lovely Iraqi man (who was later to tell me that everyone in Baghdad
    was waiting eagerly for the Americans to arrive). Some other Iraqis, who helped
    me out when I urgently needed a car stored for a week, had several edgy rottweilers
    on their semi in Rumney. Provoking such people is not big or clever. The friend,
    who might himself have been interested in wearing a Gerry Adams themed shirt,
    strongly advised against the Saddam shirt.\r\n\r\nAfter that I mostly lost interest
    in clothing that can easily be (mis)interpreted politically, apart from wearing
    a long black leather coat to ATypI in Leipzig. I checked with Adam Twardoch whether
    he thought it likely that it would be interpreted as a Nazi symbol. He reassured
    me it would not \u2013 however he still takes some pleasure in reminding me of
    my ridiculous outfit at that conference. Sadly I don't think it inspired any debates
    to rival those where the rehabilitation of blackletter is discussed.\r\n\r\n<em>Edited

    the shirt, I'm sure everybody that wears one of those has a story.  There's just
    a lot that people that wear these things need to know about what their unofficially
    backing.  The free education in Cuba is not free.  You work in the morning, on
    a field, picking potatoes, not for Cubans, but to export to Europe, then you go
    to school in the afternoon.  They barely feed the students.  The free health care
    is there if you can get a foreigner to send you the medicine you need and have
    a car to take you to Havana.  The doctor that decides he's had enough can't leave
    the country, because the government owns your education.  You know, because it
    was given to you for free.  Marriages are split because one leaves and the doctor
    wife is forced to stay behind.  I'd rather own my own education and do with it
    as I please, go to any country I choose.\r\n\r\nAnd the police won't arrest you
    in Miami for wearing a Che shirt.  They, like the Iraqis you mentioned, might
    just suggest it's not the smartest thing to walk around in one.  You'd be surprised
    how many Iraqis, Cubans, and many of those \"opressed\" love America.  With all
    its problems, its still a better option for them.  \r\n\r\ner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    I often hear great praise heaped on my ancestral countryman Alexander the Great.
    \ They say he brought \"civilization\" to the world he conquered.  That is a nice

    a marauder who conquered the world--meaning he was responsible for lots of killing

    any better than the Ottoman Turks years later who conquered and enslaved Greece?
    No better, no worse. I am Greek and have heard many stories from my grandparents
    of Turkish tyranny heaped upon Greece. I will bet that there were similar stories
    during Alexander's time about him as well. \r\nThere have been villains from every
    corner of the world. For every villain killed, another rises to fill the void.
    Every power from the Egyptians enslaving their neighbors at the time of the Pharaohs

    don't know if the term \"victim mentality\" is precisely defined, but it is often
    used in both psychology and sociology to describe an outlook of passivity and
    fixation on blaming. \r\n\r\nIt is a real phenomenon, and not healthy and not
    helpful. It is also easy to slip into. One of the sites I just found googling
    on the term explained it using the ideas of the famous psychologist Victor Frankl.
    When Frankl was in a Nazi concentration camp he found the key to survival in rejecting
    a victim mentality, even though he was certainly a victim. Suffering is a very
    real part of life, and some of us are dealt immensely tougher hands than others.
    But how we respond to our situation is in every case partly our decision--that
    is what Frankl emphasized. \r\n\r\nTiffany, I don't think it is impolite to bring
    this issue up. I think it is an important issue. How much any individual suffers
    from a 'victim' mentality is up to them to search their own soul and decide. It
    is not my call, and I'm sorry if it sounded like I was making any personal judgment,
    which I am not doing. \r\n\r\nI do note, however, that a lot of political venom
    is spit out on typophile in blaming, and very little energy in discussion of positive
    alternatives. Your discussion of EULAs is a good example of a healthier way: positively
    trying to make a difference, rather than just grumbling about 'the man' 'the establishment'
    'the system' etc, etc.\r\n\r\nI am just suggesting that a fixation on blame is
    not a very healthy or productive thing. I'll leave it at that.   "

      to say something.  The magazine was doing two stories, one on my work and another
      on Cuban design.  I had a feeling the Cuban design story was going to praise
      the Revolution, how wonderful it was for poster design, blah, blah.  It went
      over the top with praise for the whole system, as many writers tend to do with
      the Revolution.  And the glorious Che propaganda posters inside the magazine
      just added to it.  So, I, having a different opinion because of my childhood,
      felt I needed to counter the impression all of that would give.  In the end,
      I don't think the writer of the Cuba story was too thrilled with my work because
      it went against his premise, but the editors went with it, probably for balance.\r\n\r\nIf,
      say, they were to call you to do a feature on your work, and you knew there
      was another large story inside that would praise the greatness of America, with

    about hrant and not the type group at all.  He just seems so passionate and negative
    about America, and doesn't seem to find solutions within this system, such as
    you may, that I thought his energy would be more useful elsewhere, or at least
    that he shouldn't continue contributing to a system he detests so much.  Besides,
    I think he can take it.\r\n\r\nSo, you liked my cover and you disliked my cover?
    Then I did my job.\r\n\r\n>\"What\u2019s lost, unfortunately, is the difference
    between Che, the person, and Nike/iPod, the corporations.\"\r\n\r\nMy point is
    that, at this point, there is no difference, and I was trying to educate people
    about that fact, those who may not know.  Cuba, is a Capitalist country.  The
    currency is the Dollar, profit is key, they have all sorts of corrupt deals with
    European countries.  Say, Italy runs a paper company in Cuba, pays the government
    $20,000 a year per worker, and the government pays the worker $200.  My cousin
    is an accountant and has to hide these things from the employees at the factory.
    \ So, when you talk about abusive labor tactics, Nike, Che, and I-pod are all
    in the same boat.  And, like Hrant, I'm trying to get people to open their minds.
    It may have come out of the blue for some because the design community is not
    aware of this stuff, Che is just an idolized pretty icon, but I thought my additions
    would jar some people into asking some questions.\r\n\r\nThe other thing around
    here, which may come out in things I say, is that I see a very elitist attitude
    as type being the only solution to everything.  Things such as drawing a person
    is just wrong, etc. etc.  I am an illustrator, and an art director.  I use pictures,
    drawings, and type.  Such absolutism about type being of higher intellectual and
    spiritual value bugs me, so I may make fun of it once in a while.  I find a long
    discussion about what font is used in e-mail funny. No disrespect, it's just funny
    to me in the grand scheme.  And if you don't see the inherent comedy in that then
    you've been looking at type for too long, laugh at yourselves once in a while.\r\n\r\nthanks,

    history had consisted of regular periods of dynastic, regional and class warfare.
    What changed in the late 17th century was the role of the monarchy, which became
    circumscribed by law and most of its powers devolved to parliament.\r\n\r\nI sympathise,
    Hrant, that you live in a country with a particularly debased and corrupt pseudo-democracy,
    designed by 18th century oligarchs to maintain power in the hands of their class,
    but this romantic idea you have of monarchy is very naive. It certainly isn't
    any kind of solution. Monarchies are systems of familial wealth gathering established
    by violence and maintained by a mixture of mythology (the 'divine right of kings')
    and repression. It may be frustrating that protesting the actions of your government
    seems to have so little effect, but it beats having your tongue cut out."

  body: "John, here's a current illustration of a typical absolute monarchy, the <a
    href=\"http://www.nepalmonarchy.gov.np/\">Nepalese King.</a> \r\n\r\nFrom the
    'Wikipedia article':\r\n\r\n\"In 2001, after his nephew Dipendra purportedly staged
    a murder suicide, killing most of the royal family, including King Birendra (Dipendra's
    father, and Gyanendra's brother), Gyanendra became king again.The royal massacre
    has remained a controversial subject. The official investigation report mentions
    that Dipendra was drunk and was not able to control himself and yet it claims
    that within less than half an hour he carried four weapons and fired indiscriminately.
    Moreover, Dipendra was right handed and the entry wound that killed him was found
    on his left temple. This has led to speculation as to whether Dipendra was wholly
    responsible for the killings.\r\n\r\nGiven these circumstances, some Nepalese
    have lost the faith they had in the monarch as an incarnation of a god.\"\r\n\r\nI
    would add that according to a Nepalese, many in the country suspect that the current
    king himself staged the killing of his brother and family, doing the Hamlet story
    more thoroughly. \r\n\r\nIn any event, the new king dissolved parliament and tried
    to rule since 2001 as an absolute monarch, as Hrant would have it. There was increasing
    civil war, and in April the King finally gave in to pressure from the rebels,
    including the 'Maoists', and the international community, including the US and
    India. Five days ago, the King was stripped of all power by the parliament. \r\n\r\nAlmost
    everyone would say that the replacement of the King by a more democratic government,
    representing the will of the people and ending the civil war was a positive development.
    And that pressure from India and the US was a good thing. \r\n\r\nBut not, it
    would seem, Hrant, who continues with his crackpot reactionary politics in the
    face of massive historical evidence to the contrary, and the current fact that
    most of the poorest countries on earth have had some kind of absolute ruler--including
    Cuba. \r\n\r\nHrant has been repeatedly challenged by a number of people to explain
    how you can have a good process to change rulers, or remove bad rulers without
    violence other than by a democractic process. And he doesn't answer but changes
    the subject to foreign wars (which absolute rulers are equally good or bad at
    starting), or starts insulting the challenger. \r\n\r\nAs soon as you ask Hrant
    to get off wooly generalities like 'the empire', and get specific, he never answers.
    Now he claims that he focuses on 'reality' as opposed to 'formal accuracy'. In
    other words, no matter what evidence you give, he has given himself permission
    to ignore it.\r\n\r\nBecause Hrant is so intelligent and articulate, I thought,
    like Edel, that there was some point in discussing politics with with him. But
    now he has made clear that in principle he will dismiss any facts that don't fit
    with his version of 'reality'. So I no longer see the point. "

    has been  made into a hitman for capitalism, a tool for tyrants, which is the
    only thing it can really ever be, considering human nature. Many of you here blame

    in history (remembering that he's not some sort of visionary). It's not Bush talking,
    it's rampant capitalism, which benefits by democracy's power to replace nationalism
    with consumerism.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that people are trained to build houses,

    One basis he leverages is the aggregate of views and perceptions of his particular

    (second page) what you evidently refer to as \"explaining how a monarchy could

    Your main point seems to be that checks and balances are foolish and the single
    ruler must be free to \"do anything he/she wants.\" \r\n\r\nAs to getting rid
    of the monarch, \"You do it the old fashioned way. Physically depose him.\" Then
    you assure us that \"it will be swift and overt.\" \r\n\r\nSo how do we know that
    autocracy, without checks and balances, is economically and morally better, against

    to speak with only just so much authority on politics/history/government. Including
    me. \r\n\r\nThat said; my view is that no matter the system it can be benign (or
    not) but that contrary to Hrant's assertion it was not democracy but rather *industry*
    that allowed both a huge increase in populations ( via mechanised farming, longer
    food storage and transportation, and medicine) and a huge increase in our ability
    to kill via Machine guns, Bombs and Aircraft in the 20th century. I see nothing
    in a 'golden past' that suggests that monarchy was better in terms of the frequency
    of wars. The difference is population size + killing power. \r\n\r\nOn the other
    hand I agree with Hrant to this extent: The US (like every other nation in history)
    is content only with governments ( democratic or otherwise ) who meet it's capitalistic/economic
    demands. Calling for democracy is as often as not a way to call for a regime we
    can better negotiate with. Democracies inconvinient to us often get invened in.
    \r\n\r\nBemoaning the desire for consumer goods is easy for us. And no doubt the
    carrot that a 'system' or society can wield via consumer goods is very strong.
    But to me it isn't the power of these goods to shape politics that matters so
    much as the imapct of these goods on the environment that matters. Political ideology
    be damned; it seems to me that ecological sustainability is the real goal to worry
    about. \r\n\r\nBut what do I know? Not nearly enough. That much I am sure of."

    we have now). But I do think it has been done properly on occasion (like in Jordan)
    and most of all that: it can be done properly; and that it's simply the least
    unfair system (when done right).\r\n\r\nThe reason it's hard to accept that democracy

    teachers were wrong. I feel lucky that I've had many conflicting teachers, that
    I'm an ideological mongrel.\r\n\r\nCase in point: When he bothers to discuss type,
    William regularly refers to his uncle Lieberman. Who is that guy? Had anybody
    here heard of him before he brought him up? So he's published a book. So has Saddaam.
    When we were talking about the definition of \"sort\", he insisted it meant only
    alphabetic ones, because that's what his uncle said; this in spite of the dozens
    and dozens of type books everybody else has read that make no such distinction.
    I mean, there's nothing wrong with William, he's just human, and believes people
    he's emotionally attached to. It's just that when all these people come form the
    same fold, you'll naturally have trouble accepting concepts outside of that fold.

  body: "> does the world absolutely need more text type?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely need?
    No. Would it benefit? Yes. \r\n\r\nText type is definitely not only a problem
    of 'decoration'. It is also a problem of readability. The challenge of readable
    type has been regularly renewed by continually changing technology--both printing
    technology and how type is produced. \r\n\r\nFor example, in the changeover to
    digital type, most of the classic designs--which had meanwhile been put into photo
    type--were initially too light. This mistake is still being corrected. \r\n\r\nAnd
    now we have the challenge of relatively low resolution screen type (eg 96 dpi
    vs 2700 dpi for print). That is why people are interested in what others use for
    e-mail. Basically all screen type is bad--not as readable as print--and the question
    is how to make it better. People are looking for clues. And Microsoft has invested
    a lot in developing the new Clear Type technology and fonts for screen.\r\n\r\nAlso
    on the aesthetic side, I don't think the word 'decoration' quite captures what
    is going on. A typeface is like a 'voice' of the printed word. If you have a beautiful
    voice delivering a message, like a great actor, it is going to emotionally color
    it in a better way, even though you are not conscious of the voice, but rather
    are consciously focusing on the message. So for different purposes you want different
    type faces, just as different voices in song or acting. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I
    think Hrant and are in close agreement about this!"

    in other things it's brought up, maybe that wasn't clear.  See, type doesn't clear
    anything up, it's just about the darn language.\r\n\r\nI pretty much agree with
    all that you have to say.  I don't know if it has been made clear.  I am both
    an illustrator and designer.  I work with type all the time, on magazine redesigns,
    posters, etc.  I have to make all these decisions about legibility and poetry
    and \"voice\".  None of this is new to me guys.\r\n\r\nMy point is that the beautiful
    voices are not only the domain of type, there is illustration, and photo, etc.
    \ And when Paul and Hrant start talking about text type it tends to sound very
    elitist.  It's what turned me off to \"fine\" arts.  \r\n\r\nI agree, that \"Vignelli\"
    guy is nuts, and I wouldn't even write to my in-laws in helvetica.  The more type
    the better, so many moods, voices, etc.  But, you have to ask yourselves sometimes,
    as I do about myself, who is noticing?  \r\n\r\nI've sat there with my family,
    who are not highly educated, as well as with highly educated editors and writers.
    \ Pointed out the kerning, the poetry of the text type, on and on.  People don't
    see it.  I know, it's in their subconscious, but we're putting a lot of our faith
    in that subconscious aren't we?  So, sometimes, I start wondering if we're just

    Twentieth-century Communists are noteworthy for being *more* violently and fatally

    the American Communist Party in the forties and fifties. And I can't think of

    a kafiyyeh on my way to the F1 race in Phoenix, and the waitress at the roadside
    diner breaking down, contorting her face and asking: \"What does THAT mean?!\"
    That was before 9-11 though. These days I would simply get shot (after paying
    the bill of course).\r\n\r\nYou are certainly well-trained.\r\n\r\n> Daryl Gates\r\n\r\nAnother
    fond memory: the transmission in my old 2002 started failing and I made an illegal
    u-turn to avoid getting stuck in a really bad way. A cop pulled me over, and when
    he was unfazed by my circumstance, I uttered the classic \"To protect and to serve
    you like a King, eh?\" The guy, indignant, spurts out: \"Hey, I'm OCPD, not LAPD!\"
    That was funny. Anyway, when you push their limits just a little bit (which I've
    done dozens of times - I've lost track really) you see their true colors.\r\n\r\nBut
    really, the problem with US cops isn't that they're unjust, it's that effectively
    they've become fundraisers. Even our John Butler, a fiery military-family Republican,
    agress with that. The thing is, what else can they be, in such a single-mindedly
    capitalist society?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    When we got up to leave about 6 of them got up and followed us out, and surrounded

    such as the superiority of liberal democracy. That's why I make it a point to
    answer the haters. \r\n\r\nMany people seem to get their jollies by hating and
    feeling superior to the 'other', and these days the US is a favorite object of
    the hatred. Obsessive hatred often becomes a substitute for realistic analysis
    of the issues. Frightening. \r\n\r\nI don't like the macho tone and absolutism
    of the Nicholson character's speech. Reminds me too much of Bush--the character
    seems to feel that he has no need to think, to do self-criticism, to have in depth
    understanding before taking a major risk. \r\n\r\nOne of the earliest discussions
    of the moral problems of exercising power is the Talmudic discussion of an incident
    of King Saul. He met with a foreign power, and ignored their insults. As a result
    they thought he was weak. This emboldened them to start a war against the Israelites,
    in which many were killed and eventually King Saul himself died. The Talmudic
    conclusion is something like 'if you start by being kind when you should be cruel,
    you will end up being cruel when you should be kind.' This is quite contrary to
    the usual love-and-peace tone of the sages, so it is particularly startling and

    conspiracy by a central fixed cabal of shadowy figures, but simply a result of
    a decrepit core philosophy.\r\n\r\nCase in point: a few years before the Balkan

    Angola's <cite>oil wealthy</cite> Cabinda province. \r\n\r\nAnd virtually all

    - if they weren't, they would be phased out. Democracy for example is simply a
    means to an end. And I do mean End. If voting could work, it would be illegal

    probably won't be the last time we see such events.\r\n\r\nAlso, don't forget
    what the U.S. won in that war: Camp Bondsteel. While Kosovarans are struggling

    of the most modern and luxurious military installations in the world:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/camp-bondsteel.htm\r\n\r\n\"The
    Bondsteel PX offers soldiers the latest CDs, DVDs, electronics, souvenirs, clothing,

    of merchandise, the PX draws lots of multinational soldiers from throughout Kosovo.
    Also located at CBS are Burger King, Anthony\u2019s Pizza and a Cappuccino bar.\"\r\n\r\nI
    wish the U.S. did more with it's skilled tradespeople and humanitarian aid workers

    Bank but the Fund who was the big actor here) unless they ASK for them. And they
    only ask for them if they've gotten themselves into debt first. You leave the
    people in the former Yugoslavia, and especially their leaders completely out of
    the picture as key causal factors. But in peace time locals and their culture
    and institutions are in reality are the biggest influence on their fates. \r\n\r\nThis
    whole 'its all a conspiracy of the USA' thing is extremely patronizing to other
    countries, and presumes that we are so much smarter and more powerful than they,
    that they have nothing to do with their fates. Aside from its insulting and arrogant
    attitude, it  fails to explain why some countries outside the West--such as in
    Asia--have prospered and others--such as in the Middle East and Africa--have done
    so much worse. If the USA were manipulating everything rapaciously, they should
    have controlled and destroyed all of them alike. \r\n\r\nI am not saying that
    the US government hasn't done a lot of stupid and immoral things; it has. The
    whole 'enemy of my enemy is my friend' thinking has caused one disaster after
    another. This blundering and badness is one important factor, only one. And it

    it's all their fault.  What next?  O.K., so we all change to monarchies.  What

    my point of view ass backwards, William. I'm not sure why you are misreading my
    posts. This might be a good point to bring up Edel's words:\r\n\r\n\"How far can
    we go back? \"\r\n\r\nOn Kosovo, we need to go to a time before the mass killings
    began. The question is often posted, \"Should NATO have intervened once the mass
    killing occured?\" as if NATO and its member countries had no involvement BEFORE
    the killing occurred. Of course NATO was involved and NATO needs to take responsibility
    for what it did or did not do. No, William, I'm not blaming NATO for everything.
    But there is plenty of blame to pass around. NATO was never a disinterested bystander
    in Yugoslavia.\r\n\r\nThe Balkans are a warning about future international battles
    in which  capitalist powers compete against each other, rather than the old-fashioned
    (!) Cold War battles between capitalist and communist nations. It's important
    we learn some lessons.\r\n\r\n\"For example, you say \u201CI\u2019m thinking the
    Kosovars may want a chance at all those VCRs and Big Macs sometime soon.\u201D
    Hopefully they have better taste. But who is going to bring about their prosperity?
    Do the members of NATO have all the responsibility to develop their land, and
    they have no responsibility?\"\r\n\r\nAgain you misunderstand me. I believe Kosovars
    getting VCRs and Big Macs is a GOOD thing. I want them to prosper. I want them
    to have access to the same decent housing and opportunities for food and entertainment
    that U.S. GIs are enjoying at Camp Bonesteel. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. has created isolated
    bases of wealth and prosperity in the middle of areas that have been devastated
    by warfare (Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan). Isn't it logical that at some point the
    locals are gonna stop peering over the armed parapets at wealth and the good life
    enjoyed by U.S. troops and take action? Don't they have the right?"

    for them to do that. But I thought that is what they are trying to do. I think
    our armed intervention and peace keeping now gives them a shot at building a better

    battles in which capitalist powers compete against each other\r\n\r\nYou still
    seem to me to be putting all causation on the 'Capitalist' powers, and nothing
    on the locals. You still don't assign any blame to the locals, like Milosovic,
    except to say that 'there is blame enough to go around'. \r\n\r\nYou seem to be
    saying--correct me if I'm wrong--that the world's problems are a simply a byproduct
    of capitalist powers competing. I think this leaves out a critcal factor: lot
    of the problems are because poor countries have rotten governments that keep them
    poor. \r\n\r\nThe problems of the rich countries--and indeed not so rich ones
    like China is how to deal with these rotten states, like North Korea. It is not
    actually an easy problem.\r\n\r\nThe point I have been trying to make from my
    first post here is that the method of starting with blame is a bad way to understand
    social problems. The first thing is to try to understand the causes. The causes
    are complex, and only when you start to understand the mix of social conditions,
    culture, economics can you really see what needs to be changed. Assigning blame
    is part of this, but only when you understand the bigger picture do you get a
    realistic picture of who is right and wrong when. "

    (June 22 1:03 pm) by quoting me and Edel saying our views were \"ignorant of history.\"
    You may be right or wrong about my ignorance but you were certainly arguing with
    me. \r\n\r\n>I did not place blame. Not once. Why are you determined to see blame
    when it is not there?\r\n\r\nThis is what you wrote that I read as blaming:\r\n\r\n\"Deliberate
    policies led to the dismembership of Yugoslavia, including manipulation by the
    World Bank and inter-capitalist competition between Germany, France and the U.S.
    The tragedy resulted from capitalist international infighting and it probably
    won\u2019t be the last time we see such events.\"\r\n\r\nIf you did not mean to
    say that the World Bank, and infighting between Germany, France and the US were
    primarily responsible for the dismemberment of Yugoslavia--that they were primarily
    to blame (blame=responsibility for a bad thing)--then I'm sorry for misinterpreting
    you. Though it may not be what you intended to say, I must say that I don't think
    my reading is a distortion of your text.  \r\n\r\n>Didn\u2019t you say we shouldn\u2019t
    blame? And then you disagree with me because I do not properly blame the people
    you blame?\r\n\r\nNo, I said we shouldn't start out blaming, but first trying
    to understand. And I said that after making that effort, assignment of blame would
    be part of the outcome of an effort at understanding. My problem is with *starting*
    with blaming before analyzing the multiple causes of a situation. \r\n\r\nAnd
    I said that in my opinion that after such analysis you would generally find locals
    have a much larger role in the causality of what happens in their countries and
    the policies of international powers less of a role than often assigned (though
    of course an important one). So localities, in my view, deserve much more of the
    praise or blame for their own fates than much political commentary assigns. \r\n\r\nI
    thought that you were assigning too much responsibility for events to the international
    powers, but you say I simply repeatedly misread you. I don't know what your views
    are, then, and I'll leave it at that. "

  body: "The question was raised how people in Europe saw the role of NATO and the
    US in the conflicts in former Yugoslavia. I will try to give an answer.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Germany and Austria I think I can say that the majority of those people who
    had an opinion thought that the intervention was justified. They did not like
    that the longer the bombings lasted the more the focus of the bombings turned
    from military targets to civil targets and urban infrastructure, but they thought
    that the bombings could stop the ethnic cleansing. The opinion of the people in
    Greece was quite different. They saw in it senseless aggression which could only
    make things worse. \r\n\r\nHow come that people with access to more or less the
    same news drew different conclusions? I think the explanation lies in different
    historic experiences. \r\n \r\nThere was a long tradition of hostility towards
    Serbia in Austria and Germany (still stemming from the propaganda against Serbia
    in World War I) as well as sympathy for the Slovenians and Croatians (the sympathy
    for the Croatians, I am afraid I have to say, stemming from the World War II),
    which made it much more plausible to see the Serbs as the aggressors and enemies.
    \r\nThe Austrians and Germans were the first to recognize the \u2018national independence\u2019
    of Slovenia and Croatia, thus making things go really wrong. It is hard to say
    whether the tensions within Yugoslavia would have led to war in any case before
    this, but animating parts of a crumbling state to secede was like putting gasoline
    into fire. I can not say whether the politicians in Austria and Germany acted
    this way because of a mislead notion of a right of \u2018national sovereignty\u2019
    (in case of the Austrian Foreign Secretary this actually might have been the case)
    or cynical calculation, but the effect was nevertheless the same. Unfortunately
    the rest of Europe did not stop Austria and Germany.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the
    Greek population for opposing the war might have to do with the still vivid memory
    of the civil war (in which the British played a quite sinister role) and the role
    of the CIA in toppling a democratically elected government to replace it with
    a military dictatorship. The historic experience told Greece that NATO was not
    really an institution to protect Greece, but rather a source of threat.\r\n\r\nBoth
    positions, the one that backs the bombing of Serbia and the one that doesn\u2019t,
    have its weak points.\r\n\r\nYou can ask: \r\nHow can you stop ethnic cleansing
    without the use of violence?\r\nBut you can also ask:\r\nWhy did the west  animate
    \ parts of Yugoslavia to secede in the first place?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you really want
    to know more about the political problems of a specific region, you simply need
    to try to understand the historical development .  You need to read at least a
    few books about the history of that region. One which covers  the history of the
    last 150 years. If there was a civil war or similar conflicts it is always good
    to read two books about this conflict, because you can be sure that there are
    two views on this conflict. And you also need to read at least one book about
    the history of the party (and the trade unions) that represent the workers of
    this country and region \u2013 and oh, if the word communist appears in this book,
    don\u2019t be afraid to read on. Probably you would not need to drop that many
    bombs then.\r\n\r\nThere is a word for what is happening when you read on when
    the things do not correspond with your opinion or your (already acquired) knowledge
    \ - we call it learning.\r\n\r\nThe question \u2018who is right and who is wrong\u2019
    is good enough to watch a Hollywood movie, but reality is a little bit more complex."

    I am Austrian (even if I am living in the UK right now), and I can still remember
    the vivid discussions I had during this time, and the hysterical belligerent atmosphere
    then (especially in the bourgeois papers). I found it quite unbelievable how strong
    these old links to \u2018our Roman catholic brothers\u2019, the Croatians, still
    were. Of course, nobody ever said (in public): Let\u2019s partition Yugoslavia.
    Taking strongly the side of the Croatians (and Slovenians) was sold to the public
    in the media as helping the poor oppressed people. (BTW, quite similar to the
    caring voice of that guy being concerned about women\u2019s right in Islamic countries
    in that link you sent me, William - this voice has also quite belligerent undertones.)
    \r\n\r\nI focused on Austria and Germany also because I think everyone should
    try to have some influence on a local level first \u2013 how minimal and futile
    it may prove in the end.  I had no influence on what happens in Yugoslavia whatsoever,
    whereas on the local level I had at least people to discuss with.\r\n\r\nI do
    not claim that what I wrote covers more than one aspect of the partition of former
    Yugoslavia (my main topic was the perception of the situation in Yugoslavia in
    Austria and Germany as opposed to the opinion in Greece, and some historical reasons
    for this), and I am absolutely sure that some of the unmentioned aspects are far
    more important. \r\n\r\nHowever, I do not feel confident enough to comment on
    these other aspects.\r\nI am afraid you won\u2019t hear anything like \u2018the
    bombing was right\u2019 or \u2018the bombing was wrong\u2019, and if you want
    to know why, I can only refer you to my post above.\r\n\r\nI am also afraid of
    people who are too confident and too fast to jump from one historic example to
    the next (of course only selecting those which fit to the argument), using it
    like quotes that are often taken out of the context. (\u2018As the massacre of
    xxx shows xxx-ists are always ready to do the worst to their political opponents.\u2019)
    \ The result of such an approach might be a great speech that stirs up the emotions,
    but sadly this is only achieved at the expense of the intellect.\r\n\r\nThe difference
    is that whereas there are some authors who write in a aphoristic or anecdotal
    style which makes their sentences more suitable for being used as quotes, political
    developments are much more organic developments that always embedded in a longer
    story. It is always about how the members of society interact with each other
    and how they deal with influences from outside.\r\n\r\nBombs are not very organic
    things, whatever the belief of the person on whose head these are dropped might

    necessary thing to do from time to time.\r\n\r\nI got nothing to offer on the
    Belgians \u2013 sorry. \r\n\r\nHow history is remembered \u2013 now thats a very
    interesting topic.\r\n\r\nI would like to add also the question why is history
    remembered?\u2019\r\nRemembering takes an effort. It does not just happen automatically.
    \r\nThe more natural thing is to forget, not to remember. \r\nUnless there is
    some purpose involved in the act of remembering.\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting
    book on the topic of remembering, but I am afraid it is only available in German:\r\nJan
    Assmann: Das kulturelle Gedaechtnis (the cultural memory)\r\n\r\nThe theoretical
    part in this book is based on the work of the French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs.
    Some of his works are available in English.\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Halbwachs\r\n\r\nTo
    put the theory short, the book says that remembering is a social, not an individual
    activity.  \r\n(Strictly speaking the individual on it\u2019s own can only recall
    feelings and sensations. Meaning, on the other hand, is the result of a social
    process, a convention, and therefore bound to interpretation shared with others.)
    \r\nThe function of remembering is to strengthen the cohesion of a social group.
    By remembering, the group reassures itself of its identity. For the social function
    of the act of remembering it is irrelevant whether the story that is remembered
    is a myth or an actual historical event. (In modern societies it nevertheless
    tends to be a historic event. Whether this historic event is remembered in the
    same way as it actually happened is another question. In fact, it is much more
    likely that there will be some distortions). \r\n\r\nSociety has its cultural
    memory, but also sub-groups within society have their own cultural memory. \r\n\r\nThe
    cultural memory can be defined as the thing that WE MUST NEVER FORGET.\r\n \r\nThe
    cultural memory can be used to build up the loyalty of the subjects. The story
    is then usually why we are the chosen ones, we god is with us, why we are the
    highest form of life, the last link in a long, glorious chain of tradition and
    why we have to fight for these our values.  This story is being told to produce
    obedient subjects which can be turned - if needed - into cheap cannon fodder.
    \r\n\r\nSometimes, if the story is about being oppressed, it can be a very forceful
    weapon in a struggle against oppression. It also prevents the identity of the
    sub-group from being assimilated by the oppressor. The function of the memory
    is in this case to build forces of resistance. \r\n\r\nThere are, however, some
    events which to remember does not take much of an effort:\r\nhttp://www.iraqbodycount.net/"

    do. I thought Wiesel was knowlegeable and had his heart in the right place. The
    war, like all wars, was an evil thing to do, but it seemed the lesser of evils

    with regard to Kosovo; there were references to claims of genocide from sources

    Airforce'). There was plenty of evidence at the time that the Nato bombing within
    Kosovo exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, forcing both Serbs and Albanians to
    flee their homes; the former into Serbia and the latter into refugee camps in
    the Macedonian Republic. The bombing within Serbia deliberately targeted the country's
    civil industrial and communcations infrastructure, despite the fact that this
    infrastructure was in no way connected with the actions of the Yugoslav army in
    Kosovo.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of the campaign, the number of confirmed Albanians
    killed by Yugoslav forces during the conflict with the KLA, which has been estimated
    in the tens of thousands by Nato information officers and western politicians
    -- or even as high as 100,000 amid charges of escalation of Serb atrocities during
    the bombing --, was found to be in the hundreds. No evidence appears to have been
    presented of a deliberate policy of extermination.\r\n\r\nWhatever the reality
    of the humanitarian situation within Kosovo and the causes of it -- and there
    are certainly conflicting accounts -- it is difficult not to see the Nato campaign
    as part of a longer US policy of dismantling the socialist economy in Yugoslavia
    and the 'opening up of the market' throughout the former country.\r\n\r\nThe irony
    of the Kosovo situation is that one of the first significant acts in the breakup
    of Yugoslavia was the declaration by Croatian nationalist politicians that Croatia
    -- with Slovenia the wealthiest of the federal republics -- should not have to
    subsidise Kosovo. \r\n\r\nFinally, it would be difficult to overstate the importance
    of Kosovo to the Serbian national identity. The fact that there is a very large
    number of ethnic Albanians of Moslem faith living in Kosovo is a result of Ottoman
    policy. But Kosovo is the historical Serb heartland, site of many of Serb Orthodoxy's
    oldest and most famous monasteries and churches. The Ottoman population policy
    is an old example of the centuries-old meddling of outside powers in the region;
    the Nato bombing is a more recent one."

    now the misunderstanding is on your side. I have re-read my posts on this thread,
    and I have never 'demanded' anything. And please stop being so personal. It is
    not called for and is offensive.\r\n\r\nI did say that so long as Hrant dismisses
    mere \"formal accuracy\" that I did not want to debate politics with him. For
    this view in advance permits a person to dismiss any facts contrary to his opinions.
    Hrant is certainly free to express his political views, will I'm sure continue
    to do so. And I certainly do not want to limit his freedom of political speech.
    \  \r\n\r\nMy point all along is that the focus on blaming the US ignores more
    complex causes of world problems, including the important contributions of neighbors
    and locals. \r\n\r\nIn the Kosovo case this included European neighbors and locals,
    particularly Milosovic. This is certainly not my area of expertise, but I still
    feel that those closer to the scene were far more important than the US in creating
    the mess. \r\n\r\nSince I find that every plea to consider non-US causes, and

    you've ignored the people on the scene who worked day and night to stop the killing
    in Yugoslavia. Just as the people who worked against Saddam on the ground in Iraq
    were ignored. Just as the people who work against any brutal leader on the ground
    are ignored by outsiders. We take actions that support, or at least fail to oppose,
    brutality for years in these places and then we pretend we are shocked, shocked!
    that things have gotten so brutal. I'm no longer willing to accept that particular

    easily and often is. If democracy in the U.S. is reduced simply to the choice
    between voting for one rich man who hasn't a clue or another rich man who hasn't
    a clue, then it's pretty ridiculous. But that's not where we are at right now.
    We have areas in which democracy works wonders in our own lives. It might be your
    union or your church or your book group. Each of us has experienced it in one
    way or another. Once you've tasted that, it's pretty hard to give up.\r\n\r\nYou
    can imagine it even in our small universe. We have a form of democracy here that
    we enjoy very much. People share their knowledge of typography freely and openly.
    But what if we set up a system where we rewarded people for their arcane knowledge
    (and not just a book or CD at those TypeCon trivia contests). What if you could
    charge people for getting their font identified -- and charge people A LOT? What
    if Yves and Stephen and Tiffany the rest of them could get rich protecting and
    selling off their knowledge of glyphis? How long do you think it would take for
    our little democracy to fall apart? \r\n"

  body: "On paper printed with green and black ink, pictures of U.S. Presidents are
    avidly sought after.\r\n\r\nThe United States of America, although imperfect compared
    to countries like Canada and New Zealand (Sweden might have made this list, but
    apparently it has totalitarian tendencies, as it must have suppressed support
    for the U.S. military action in Vietnam, as someone making a documentary couldn't
    find any books in Swedish taking that position in their libraries) due to the
    heavy weight of its international responsibilities, is a democratic nation, and
    the democratic nation on whose military strength the survival of the other democratic
    countries, and thus the hope for a decent and meaningful future for humanity rests.\r\n\r\nSo
    I don't think I agree with what you're getting at, even if it seems as though
    I've laid it on so thick in the paragraph above that I must be sarcastic.\r\n\r\n(EDIT:
    I had previously added what is below to my post above to avoid a double post.
    I have moved it now to be part of this post instead to make it clear it was not
    part of what Hrant was responding to as I typed it.)\r\n\r\n@John Hudson:\r\n<cite>The
    bombing within Serbia deliberately targeted the country's civil industrial and
    communcations infrastructure, despite the fact that this infrastructure was in
    no way connected with the actions of the Yugoslav army in Kosovo.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell,
    it would perhaps motivate the authorities within Serbia to recall their army <em>from</em>
    Kosovo.\r\n\r\nI don't see what the problem is. If members of an ethnic, religious,
    or linguistic group are discriminated against or oppressed, any responsible democracy
    is entitled to say that this  shall end immediately. Or else.\r\n\r\nSo, for example,
    if the problems faced by Christians in Pakistan or Egypt don't end immediately,
    in this post-9/11 era, when the world's Muslims ought to know they're being held
    under close, microscopic scrutiny to see if they have any Taliban-like tendencies,
    the U.S. is fully and entirely within its rights to carry out regime change in
    those areas.\r\n\r\nEssentially, except for voluntary immigrants who have moved
    to the homeland of a different ethnic group in search of greater economic opportunity,
    everyone should be free to live in an independent soverign nation of his own cultural
    group so as to be completely safe from being a minority. 99.99% of the world's
    people should be part of a majority of at least 95% where they live. And, yes,
    this applies to the Inuit and the Hawaiians too.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we
    didn't have to move political boundaries around like this, because sometimes there
    is violence when governments object, but any other solution involves changing
    human nature for the better so that people are always nice to each under under
    circumstances where, in the past, we know this was not guaranteed. If one is really
    interested in human well-being, one should pursue practical solutions, not dreams
    that have proven themselves to be idle fantasies again and again.\r\n\r\nSo, in
    my opinion, not only is Zionism not racism, Zionism - for everyone, not just Jews
    - is the only answer to racism."
