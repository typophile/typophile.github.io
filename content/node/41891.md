  but I can't say for sure what their names are.\r\n\r\nThe first one is from FX Brasil,
  a TV channel. It looks very close to a typeface I have (ITC Century Std), but it
  is not 100% the same.\r\n\r\nThe second one is from a book my brother is reading,
  called The Scarlet Letter, by Nathaniel Hawthorne. I scanned a page from the book.
  From the typefaces I have, it looks close to Book Antiqua and Palatino Linotype.\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help me in those two cases? I have attached the files to this forum topic."

    Schoolbook]], based mostly on the 'a' tail. There are a number of different foundry
    versions, so that is harder to pin down, but no significant differences between
    any of them to my eye.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mr. Yanega, I just read on the TypeWiki that Palatino Linotype is a revised
    version of the typeface, but made in 1999. Is it any different from the version
    that you mentioned (Herman Zapf\u2019s Palatino)?"

  body: "I think the Wiki may be referring to changes in the digital font from the
    original metal version. I believe Herr Zapf did/does his work for the Linotype
    foundry, so there is no difference. \"Palatino Linotype\" is just the way the
    font file is named -- it is still Hermann Zapf's design.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    Adobe based on the Linotype design, and Palatino Linotype, which is the purely
    Linotype digitization of the same font (both based on the 1950 original metal
    version). There is also the 2005 Palatino Nova, which Zapf updated with Akira
    Kobiyashi.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    user. Hence the loss of subtle curves like in the stems of Optima (and probably
    a lot of other fonts\u2026).\r\nSince processing power is no issue anymore, foundries
    are putting back the subtleties (and making more money of these workhorses as
    well).\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
