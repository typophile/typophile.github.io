  alt="Tootsie">  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been trying to research odd design characterists
  of very bold typefaces and was particularly interested in the lowercase i. Anything
  similar &#40;or any interesting extra bold typefaces&#41; would be helpful.  <BR>
  <BR>Thank you, <BR>Jackson Cavanaugh

  body: I don&#39;t think that &#39;i&#39; goes with that type. It would be very easy
    to draw, and I can&#39;t recall that well, but is that a re-creation of part of
    the Tootsie Roll candy trademark?

    target="_blank">these images</a>, which include old and new pictures of the Tootsie
    Roll brand. <BR> <BR>The oldest ones are somewhat squared letters, the newer ones
    look a lot like Cooper Black.

    target="_blank">Rockwell Extra Bold</a>, especially the s. There was also a very
    similar font called Welt, but I don&#39;t know of that&#39;s available digitally.

  body: Back to your question. I think Tootsie is modified from a slab serif font
    like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/memphis/extra-bold/testdrive.html?s=Tootsie&amp;p=60"
    target="_blank">Memphis Extra Bold</a>. If I mutilate the top of the &#39;t&#39;,
    and fill in the o&#39;s, I think I get pretty close &#40;when I draw my straight
    line &#39;i&#39;&#41;.

  body: You also asked about other ultra bold fonts and what happens to some of the
    letters. The super heavy weights of the Gill Sans family are probably good examples.
    <BR> <BR>See <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gill-sans/ultra-bold/charmap.html"
    target="_blank">Gill Sans Ultra Bold</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/gill-kayo-condensed/condensed/charmap.html"
    target="_blank">Gill Kayo Condensed</a> to see some interesting alterations to
    the lower case &#40;and upper case&#41; at those weights.

  body: Wow, thanks for the fast response. The research on the bold fonts is actually
    part of a project involving Gill Kayo. The i in the sample above was interesting
    to me because the quirkiest thing about Kayo is how the dots of the i and j are
    treated. Thanks again!

  body: I&#39;m sure it&#39;s documented somewhere, but I recall that Gill Kayo was
    Gill&#39;s almost facetious answer to giving the market what it wanted--a vulgar
    ultrabold sans.
