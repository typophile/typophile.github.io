  body: "Sorry, but i cant see any similarity between this and goudy old style! it's
    so different! - different axis, different x-height, completely different serifs,
    straighter stems... Pray tell me how it's 'close enough'!?\r\nStill, thanks anyway
    - I can't talk - i haven't got very far on this one either.\r\nAnyone else?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Seminar]] was close. I think it isn't exact, though. The other font I looked at
    for a bit was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-slimbach/|Slimbach]], which
    also seems close to me, but I can't say if that's it.\r\n\r\nSo far those are
    my best ideas.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    you very much Celeste.\r\nCoincidentally, I had at one point checked that this
    typeface wasn't Christopher Burke's Celeste. They are not similar really, but
    there are some shared interests. \r\n\r\n"
