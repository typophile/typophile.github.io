    why having real quotes in web sites can be a PITA, and things can look like crap
    when some people are using them and some aren\u2019t. People got by just fine
    not having access to smart quotes outside of books and magazines for what, a century-plus?
    It\u2019s a bit much to expect everybody to start caring about them."

    the quality is plummeting."

    enter. It's reasonable, I suppose, if the rest of the text can be straight-up
    ASCII, to make this change: some older mail-readers have trouble with non-ASCII
    symbols. But Google really should leave the curly quotes alone if the rest of

  body: At the risk of being publicly stoned for saying it--and even knowing how typographically
    wrong it is--I dislike smart quotes online as well. Perhaps it's less of an aesthetic
    choice and more of a "it's what we're used to" thing.

    got by when typewriting letters, since the typewriter only contained prime marks.
    But typewritten paper was not the bulk of most people's reading. Most of their
    reading would have been typeset, in books and magazines. \r\n\r\nJason C"

  body: "It's funny: if the people at Quick Stop had phrased their request slightly
    differently, focusing more on the \"for whatever reason, smart quotes screw up
    something in our system, so we'd rather it stuck to straight ones\", we'd all
    (I expect) have gone \"shame, but fair enough\". Instead, because they said \"Smart
    quotes! We hate \u2019em!\", the typophile's natural response is \"philistines!\"\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "\"Typewriter quotes\" are ASCII quotes. \"Smart quotes\" are the raised comma
    and the turned comma. And by the way, the raised comma is also the apostrophe.\r\n\r\nIt
    does matter when you use the Latin alphabet for some transliterated languages.
    Look at how Omniglot shows Apache: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.omniglot.com/writing/apache.htm\r\n\r\nNow
    in Apache, that ASCII apostrophe should be a raised comma to signal a glottal
    stop. But not all orthographies use the raised comma for the glottal stop; for
    whatever reason, Polynesian uses a turned comma for just the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe
    confusion between ASCII apostrophe & raised & turned commas has let some web sites
    who fail to notice the distinction to make errors, and some publishers look at
    sites such as Omniglot to request the ASCII apostrophe to signal a glottal stop
    in some Native American languages -- which is flat out wrong.\r\n\r\nThe typewriter
    is pretty dead. The ASCII apostrophe & quotes should die with it."
