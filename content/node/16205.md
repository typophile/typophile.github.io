  \"M\" and others show well differences.\r\nI would be not surprised, if that some

  Thank for help."

    Syntax, Quay Sans, et al -- but I can't find an exact match.

  body: Thank you marcox and Bald for help. I know this type-bastards. This is already
    the 4th creation from an agency and I feel the man behind such work. And I never
    get information of this. Ok I customized "Infinity" for my identity, but you can
    see, that K-letter definitely reworked, not such minimal modification. Other question
    is... the wight of "New Lucida Sans"... it`s wider and more bold. Hmm.
