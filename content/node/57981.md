  we are to gather some data and design a positive piece that exhibits our findings.\r\n\r\nFor
  my project, I've chosen postcards! I am really excited about the project. In order
  to gather some data, I've built a website. Check it out at:\r\n\r\nwww.onepostcard.com\r\n\r\nIf
  everyone would be so kind as to take the survey and to upload some postcards.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
