body: "Please take a look at the attached pdf....I would appreciate any comments/suggestions.
  The book is a identification guide for the sharks and skates of Alaska. I included
  a few front matter pages and a few main body pages. The book is 8.5 x 5.5 and will
  open vertically with a spiral bind. The table of contents hasn't been worked out
  yet, and also the \"key\" (p.9-11) has given me the most trouble. The editor insists
  this is the best way to display the information because that is how the author did
  in his rough draft. I think it is really hard to follow. The typeface used is Myriad
  Pro...very basic, but the non-profit budget doesn't allow for many choices. Thank
  you in advance for any commments/suggestions!\r\njen gunderson"

  body: "I can see why the key is proving difficult (although I don\u2019t have any
    knowledge of sharks or access to the relevant pages) I suppose part of the problem
    is knowing your audience, I think this is presuming a high(ish) level of knowledge
    while making it difficult (or less easy) for a student or someone with an interest
    to follow. What were you offering as an alternative?\r\n\r\nTim"

    body: 'The alternative I offered was the same format except 2 column and instead
      of the dotted line leading to the column edge, I had an em space with the end
      item semibold. For some reason, I can''t attach a pdf to this reply so hopefully
      you can visualize it. It definitely makes it look nicer, but I''m not sure it
      helps the content to be better understood. '

  body: "You should be able to post a second pdf in your original post (leave the
    first for comparison). Can you explain what the figures in the lefthand column
    relate to, assuming that those in the far right relate to page numbers. Again
    as a total novice in shark matters, I would have thought the process for identifying
    would start with point 2 and 2(1) body shape and progress from there, almost the
    basis of a flow chart with yes/no options to narrow down to definite identification.\r\n\r\nTim"

    body: "Thanks, I attached the second pdf to my original post. This is where it
      gets confusing....the numbers on the far right only refer to page numbers if
      it specifically has the word \"page\" before the number. Otherwise, the number
      is referring the reader to find that number in the left hand column, leading
      them to another description. So yes, it is  like a flow chart.\r\n\r\nJen"

  body: "I would renumber the diagram on page ii so the numbering scheme actually
    makes sense - either left-to-right, top-to-bottom, or spiral clockwise from top
    left or something. I also think that type would work better here than hand-drawn
    numbers.\r\n\r\nI don't understand how the key is supposed to work, even with
    your description. Both versions are equally confusing. Why are there sometimes
    numbers in parentheses in the left column? If it's supposed to work like a flowchart,
    why not make it a flowchart?\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    body: "Good suggestion about the diagram on page ii, thanks. Sadly, I actually
      just placed that one without paying much attention.\r\n\r\nThe numbers in parentheses
      are supposed to tell the reader which step they just came from. I agree...it's
      totally confusing. The editor had to explain it to me a hundred times. A flow
      chart seems like a good solution. I'll see what I can come up with.\r\n\r\nJen"

  body: "Well if the flowchart is feasible it might be the most effective way to go,
    in the face of an editor though, an alternative might be to replace the lefthand
    column numerals (and where they occur in the righthand) with letters or Roman
    numerals*, maybe including an arrow or instruction like \u2018go to\u2019 or \u2018from\u2019,
    speaking of which on your second pdf I would be inclined to tab all the righthand
    column to the width of the column. Your new layout is certainly more attractive
    to read and look at.\r\n*However that would affect the lowercase roman numerals
    used for intro pages.\r\n\r\nTim"
