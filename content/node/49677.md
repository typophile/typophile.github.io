  body: "Windows has native support for \"PostScript\" (Type 1) fonts on Windows 2000,
    XP and Vista. They are natively supported for applications using the GDI and WPF
    APIs, but not for GDI+ (which is little used anyway).\r\n\r\nA few Windows applications
    only work with TrueType fonts. The most notable such application is AutoCAD.\r\n\r\nOther
    than that, the other important thing to know is that the Windows flavor of Type
    1 is a physically different file format than the Mac flavor. You can't copy Mac
    Type 1 fonts to Windows and have them work.\r\n\r\nOpenType fonts with PostScript
    style outlines (OpenType CFF fonts) work fine on both Windows and Macs.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: If your question was, 'will <em>my</em> Mac Postscript fonts work on a PC'
    then the answer is no, unless you convert them with something like CrossFont or
    unless you re-generate them with Fontlab or Fontographer. All .otf Postscript
    fonts are cross-platform compatible. The latest version of CrossFont will convert
    Mac fonts either into PC or into OpenType (.otf) format. I haven't used the program
    in years, but in the past have always found it to work flawlessly.
