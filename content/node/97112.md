body: "Hi everyone :)\r\n\r\nJust registered here to ask you all if anyone is able
  to identify these fonts. I used the first one a year or two back, the second about
  2-3 years back for a custom interface in a game. Unfortunately I can't find any
  records of them as I appear to have lost the files.\r\n\r\nI do happen to have a
  1080p video that I'd recorded at that time, and I've screenshotted as much as I
  could of the fonts into one image. Some lines were very small (hence the low quality)
  but hopefully it's enough!\r\n\r\nI have a hunch I found the second one on a fonts
  website under the Sci-Fi category or similar (I may be just making this up, I don't
  remember for sure).\r\n\r\nTranscripts are under the images that show exactly what
  they say (including correct case).\r\n\r\n#1:\r\n<img src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii11/Bobblybook/Untitledfont_zpsc6f78c1a.png\">\r\n<code>Shadow
  Orb x3!\r\n+256 Mana [3 Hits]\r\n(Allenda) +1517 <84> [10 Hits]</code>\r\n\r\nAs
  you can see, the uppercase/lowercase shapes look all mixed up. The numbers look
  fairly normal. That \"r\" in \"Orb\" has a bit of a funny leg though.\r\n\r\n#2:\r\n<img
  src=\"http://i260.photobucket.com/albums/ii11/Bobblybook/unknownfont_zps43f79cb9.png\">\r\n<strong>From
  left to right:</strong>\r\n\r\n<code>(Cheri) +0 <812>\r\n(Cheri) +0 <2248></code>\r\n\r\n<code>[Backdraft]\r\n+223
  Mana</code>\r\n\r\n<code>Pet 697 <78 resisted>\r\n4062\r\n1208 <134 resisted>\r\n+0
  <2477> (Nokgup) (3 Hits)\r\n11239</code>\r\n\r\n<code>[Ancestral Fortitude]\r\n-[Shadow
  Resistance Aura]\r\n-[Moonkin Aura]\r\n(Chopbuster) +10126</code>\r\n\r\nThis font
  I can't find at all!! A few things which stand out to me over similar fonts:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Tiny
  <> brackets in this font</li>\r\n<li>The \"3\" has a sharp-angled top (whatever
  they're called in the font community)</li>\r\n<li>The \"9\" has a larger hole in
  the middle than the gap at the bottom. Many similar fonts have these spaces equal
  and basically have a backwards \"E\" shape.</li>\r\n<li>The capital \"C\" curls
  up a little at the bottom.</li>\r\n<li>The \"b\", \"p\" and \"u\" letters have a
  little pixel gap between the main line and the connecting curve, where the curved
  line appears to continue in a circle shape. Other fonts tend to have this line connecting
  at right angles without this tiny gap.</li>\r\n<li>The tail on the lowercase \"g\"
  doesn't appear to curl all the way under.</li>\r\n<li>The \"k\" shape is fairly
  unique. I have been using that \"Nokgup\" image to compare similar fonts and there's
  usually a difference there.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nA couple of similar fonts I've
  found are:\r\n<ul><li>[[http://www.identifont.com/show?24U|Handel Gothic (BT)]].
  This doesn't have the \"C\" curling and the \"e\" is wrong. Letters are a little
  too high I think too, the one I used was more squashed down.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>[[http://www.identifont.com/show?H0|Cable]].
  This one has a closer \"e\" but a lot of the points mentioned above don't fit, and
  looking at the capital \"S\" in particular, the font I'm looking for is a lot more
  squished down vertically.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nSorry about the long post, I figured
  more info was better than less :) Hopefully this isn't too much of a challenge for
  the pros!"
