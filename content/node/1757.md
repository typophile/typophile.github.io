  src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/19023.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>I may
  not have the proportions of the white squares to the black exact.  <BR> <BR>The
  idea is that when you look at this your brain does a &#39;gestalt switch&#39; between
  seeing white squares against black one moment, and a framed cross the next. <BR>
  <BR>Noordzij says &#34;Real characters have built-in stabilizers that keep black
  shapes in the forground&#34;. In other words, they avoid the dazzle in this illustration.  <BR>
  <BR>I am interested in what you experienced type designers think of the problem
  of avoiding dazzle, particularly in text faces.  <BR> <BR>First of all, do you think
  Noordzij has it right? Is getting type to rest on the page a matter of balancing
  white and black? And what are your thoughts on doing it? <BR> <BR>What would make
  me question whether the black/white balance is all of the story is the to me undesirable
  dazzle in many of the &#39;didone&#39; class of type in small sizes. It seems like
  part of the story is just the thinness of the lines.  <BR> <BR>I was recently struck
  by how well Kent Lew&#39;s new face, Whitman, &#39;rests&#39; on the page, at least
  judged by the samples on the internet. I am interested in how he and others have
  approached this problem. '

    <BR>which is why I use it so successfully for display, but never text. <BR>But
    I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t explain exactly why it dazzles, other <BR>than the
    sharp serifs.

  body: I think GN is totally right about the centrality of balancing the Black and
    White. I call it notan &#40;a Japanese term&#41;. Ironically, notan is the reason
    his theories of type design don&#39;t make sense! <BR> <BR>&#62; &#34;Real characters
    have built-in stabilizers that keep black shapes in the forground&#34; <BR> <BR>There
    is no foreground &#40;at least not during immersive reading&#41;. We read notan,
    the balance, not the Black and White separately. <BR> <BR>The relevance of notan
    to type design is complex, because we have to design &#34;firm&#34; atomic blacks,
    but half the whites &#40;the sidebearings&#41; exist on a more abstract level
    &#40;since they only work in pairs&#41;. OpenType actually allows us to equalize
    the treatment of Black and White &#40;by designing entire words which would get
    swapped in contextually&#41;, but I don&#39;t see many people doing that... <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I am hoping that this will lure some others as well into spilling secrets
    of &#39;notan&#39;. As well as Kent Lew&#39;s accomplishment, mentioned above,
    James Montalbano&#39;s Clearview seems to be an example where this was thought
    out carefully.  <BR> <BR>He notes on his website that the typeface is designed
    to reduce &#39;halation&#39; experienced by older drivers looking at lighted signs
    at night. <BR> <BR>What is this about? <BR> <BR>For myself, I think that fineness
    of lines and points can create dazzle, as well as evenly spaced parallel lines.
    I think there are psycho-optical effects going on that affect comfort in reading,
    but they do seem to be complex.  <BR> <BR>  '

  body: '&#62;reduce &#39;halation&#39;  <BR> <BR>I believe the term <i>halation</i>
    refers to a sort of &#39;erosion&#39; of a letter&#39;s outline due to the refelcted
    light from its counter. Or vice versa. <BR> <BR>E.g., the letter <i>b</i>&#39;s
    counter looks like a circle - at night, on a reflective background - instead of

    What I&#39;m trying to say is that the aura, or &#39;halo&#39;, reflected from

  body: 'Thanks so much, James; that is really interesting.  <BR> <BR>Hrant, your
    hypothesis on why the same considerations apply to text sizes seems plausible
    to me.  <BR> <BR>When you look at a page of small text in Helvetica or Bodoni,
    the problem is not that you can&#39;t read it. It is that it is noticeably more
    effort to do it, and it probably slows you down also. If we do, as you &#40;and
    others?&#41; hypothesize gather significant information outside our center of
    focus, then that would explain it. <BR> <BR>The sharp points and hairlines - and
    more closed counters etc - would fuzz out before more beefy points and lines,
    and open counters, so you would lose that information.  <BR> <BR>It may even be
    that this is the cause of the &#39;dazzle&#39; experience. When you look away
    slightly from part of the text with sharp or thin lines, they fuzz into vanshing,
    and move your eyes they &#39;pop&#39; back into appearance. This would explain
    the &#39;twinkling&#39; experience.  <BR> <BR>I do have the feeling that there
    are also some &#39;optical illusion&#39; effects as Noordzij hypothesizes. -and
    the two types may interact.  <BR> <BR>With Whitman, the &#39;resting&#39; effect
    is noticable to me at least, but it is a very different face from Clearview -
    and less beefy than James Montalbano&#39;s Rawlings.  <BR> <BR>I hope we can rope
    Kent Lew into commenting on this also. <BR> <BR>Very informative!   '

  body: '&#62;test the design ...in the actual environment. <BR> <BR>This is very
    important for newspaper fonts. One&#39;s typefaces &#40;both headline and text&#41;
    may look perfect on a laser proof on white paper, but they will be dull printed
    with dark grey ink &#40;aka black, but nowhere near the density of toner&#41;
    on light grey newsprint paper. So a little pre-emptive dazzle is required.  <BR>
    <BR>So to answer the original post, if I&#39;m designing a typeface for a specific
    use, I try and get what I consider to be just enough sparkle, but not too much
    dazzle, for that context, and, as James says, do in situ tests. <BR> <BR>However,
    with more &#34;experimental&#34; typefaces &#40;and perhaps Vendome may be so
    described&#41;, I may decide to crank up the dazzle to 11 just for the hell of
    it, and let typographers figure out what to do with the font. Hence Eunoia. <BR>
    <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/19121.jpg" alt="TurnUpTheDaz">
    <BR> <BR>With a dazzling font, the typographer has the option of playing off the
    dazzle by printing it in subtle colors, or on rough stock, or very small, or filtered,
    or moving fast, or low res, in which circumstances the dazzle can be considered
    a pre-emptive sharpening. Or the typographer may use the font precisely for its
    eye-popping effect.'

    of the paper and ink. - A design might work well with low contrast, but dazzle
    with high, or be too low contrast for easy reading, but fine with high.  <BR>
    <BR>Are different factors involved here in design issues? <BR> <BR>This seems
    to get more and more complicated. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, can anyone report on
    what Gerard Unger said about readibility at ATypI? I saw a picture with him standing
    in front of a slide about brightness, so he may have touched on these issues also.

    <BR> <BR>&#62;a box of tricks to turn up or down the dazzle <BR> <BR>Generally,
    I don&#39;t think about it too much. There are so many design axes &#40;or elements
    in the graphic language of a typeface&#41;, and once you get the knack of type
    design, they all get mashed together, into a global skill. <BR> <BR>I would say
    that dazzle is a question of contrast and precision, so it can manifest in any
    parameter -- which is why Bodoni is so dazzling across the board, as it has strong
    thick/thin stem-width contrast, and also sharp serifs -- sharpness being a strong
    figure/ground contrast at the level of detail. Bodoni also has a strong contrast
    between straight and round forms. <BR> <BR>The dazzle that is caused by an equivalence
    of positive/negative forms, where there&#39;s ambivalence about which is figure
    and which ground, is apparent in Vendome, where the sharpness of the serif shape
    is &#34;mirrored&#34; in the sharpness of the acute joints. <BR> <BR>Another kind
    of dazzle caused by equivalence and precision is the &#34;picket fence&#34; effect
    of evenly spaced vertical stems. <BR> <BR>Again, on the subject of equivalence,
    when a typeface has a very precise evenness of spacing between characters -- I
    mean the almost imperceptible negative &#34;hairline&#34; space between adjacent
    serifs -- this creates sparkle, if not dazzle. You can also see that in Extra
    Bold House Gothic. <BR> <BR>'

  body: Yes. If you &#34;turn off the preview mode&#34; when examining a font character,
    you are left with just a thin perimeter. In Vendome, the line is extremely angular,
    whether it goes round the outside or inside of a corner -- creating positive and
    negative shapes that are similar. You don&#39;t get this in say, Times, for although
    it has sharp serifs and high stroke contrast, its serifs are bracketed.
