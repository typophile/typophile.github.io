  body: Martin, <BR> <BR>Is it spose to be a little joke about &#34;branding&#34;
    to make it look like livestock branding with a hot iron? <BR> <BR>If so maybe
    choose an old western typeface &#40;put your own twist on it though, funk it up&#41;
    and make that B look a lot more like a branding iron. Possibly stick with black
    / charcoal as a colour. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>Ken
