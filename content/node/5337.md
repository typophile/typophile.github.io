body: In the US the billboards have the oblique sans-serif font in white on dark blue
  background. I&#39;ve also seen this in various print publications but can&#39;t
  fine it anywhere on the Internet including the A-B web site and the Bud Light web
  site. Go figure.

  body: If memory serves me it&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-meta/black-italic/testdrive.html?s=Choose%2Bon%2BTaste&amp;p=60">meta
    black italic</a>. &#40;Sorry if that&#39;s incorrect. I don&#39;t have a sample
    to check against.&#41;

  body: I &#40;finally&#41; drove by one of these billboards last night. I&#39;m pretty
    sure it&#39;s <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/F/MYRP/F_MYRP-10012300.jhtml"
    target="_blank">Myriad Bold Italic</a> or possibly <a href="http://store.adobe.com/type/browser/F/MYRP/F_MYRP-70019300.jhtml"
    target="_blank">Myriad Black Condensed Italic</a>. Anyway, some version of Myriad
    Italic, not Meta.

  body: Wow. Typophile is amazing! I previously tried Identifont but didn&#39;t have
    an example to examine and compare. <BR> <BR>Karl&#39;s suggestion of Meta Black
    Italic seemed close but I couldn&#39;t get a large enough view of their font set
    to judge. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not the Myriad Black Condensed on the billboard. Surely
    it&#39;s the Myriad Bold Italic. The Myriad family has been around for ages; surprised
    that it didn&#39;t jog my memory. The e,g,b and r really help in the ID, I believe.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m new here. Do I vote for Karl for the photo or Mark for the ID?
    Hmmm:-&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks for sparing me the trip out to I-10 tomorrow with
    my camera!! Way cool!

  body: Karl, where did that photo come from? I know that you and I both live in the
    Minneapolis/St. Paul area. It looks like it&#39;s on a subway or train, but the
    new light rail transit system we have here doesn&#39;t start operation until tomorrow...
    Surely, it&#39;s not an MTC bus, is it? Just curious...

  body: I was in New York two weeks ago and snapped that photo while riding the train.
    I wish I could say I had a premonition that someone would need the font identified.
    <BR> <BR>Actually though the &#34;Choose on Taste&#34; line has been a running
    joke among friends. I contend that it sounds as if it were written by a <a href="http://nrg.ncl.ac.uk/news/neanderthal.jpg">homo
    neanderthalensis</a> due to the questionable grammar. I couldn&#39;t balk at the
    opportunity to document the bud light saturation I experienced in this particular
    subway car. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad it turned out to be helpful in a type id request.
