  complains about the kerning in this design with any of the letters?, have I broken
  any don't do's?\r\n2) Would you notice any change if I was to purchase \"Eurostile
  Next\" and changed the font to that? It is currently set in the old Eurostile and
  I can't really see a difference between the two, I have only used \"try font\" on
  a font website for me to determine this.\r\n\r\nThanks heaps for your time\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SNAG_4033.jpg]"

  body: "Metrically the SNAG component looks dead on\u2013 optically the word looks
    weighted because of the SN; really it's the negative space of the Cap A. Have
    you thought of kerning the A in s it touches the N and then kerning in the G?\r\n\r\nI
    have a real problem with tracked-out punctuation as in CO. \u2013 it's just wrong;
    sorry. There are no rules pertaining to  it but it's a \".\" lost in space. ;

  body: "Yeah Good point on the \".\" it really is lost in space haha. What do you
    mean by \"optically the word looks weighted\" because of the SN; really it\u2019s
    the negative space of the Cap A\". If you could help break that down that will
    be awesome. Your help is much appreciated. So you think the A and N need to touch?"

  body: "I think what Mac_56 means is that the SN pair seems to form a solid, structured
    block, whereas the AG pair seems a lot more loose. I agree with him on that, and
    also agree that it must be because of the extra negative space afforded by A.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    what weight is SNAG set in? I realize that Eurostile comes in an extended variety,
    but somehow it seems to me a tiny bit stretched on the horizontal.\r\n\r\n- \u2014

  body: "OK, Here\u2019s what I think:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SNAG_spacing_4450.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
    you need to aim for is a balance between innerspace (space within\u2014 lightblue)
    and intraspace (space between \u2014 pink). \r\nStart with the largest of the
    innerspaces, in this case N or G, and then try to make the intraspaces equal to
    that. In your sample the S is way to close to the N.\r\nOnce you have balanced
    everything you can either substract or add equal amounts of space between the
    glyphs, depending on what your aiming for (tension, or light colour, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe
    other line: Wordpace is excessive. Wordspace equal to the innerspace of N is adequate.
    The dot should be way closer to the O, and do not line it up with the topline,
    but let it stick out somewhat.\r\n\r\nAnd try looking at this up-side-down or
    in a mirror.\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "It seems to me that the overshoots on S and G are too small.\r\nI noticed
    that, but not anything about the kerning.\r\nThe N overpowers the other letters.\r\nThe
    way Novarese designed it may be OK in general, but for a four-letter logo, some
    tweaking of the glyph may be necessary.\r\n"

  body: "I'm with Nick on this one. There are competing factors in spacing. One is
    how far apart the closest blacks are. Another is visual equality between the letters.
    Another is balance between inner and outer. Your first goes for the first one.
    I think that is OK, if you want compactness, which you might want in a logo. The
    other way is what Bert said, but if you want to go that way I think you need the
    S still further away. \r\n\r\nAs Nick says, the joins on the N may be too heavy.
    Try slightly reducing the width of the verticals.\r\n\r\nOn the bottom line the
    OT looks too wide, but slightly tweaking the whole thing is probably needed for
    perfect balance. I don't see why you need the period at all. "
