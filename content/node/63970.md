  body: "I would say that it seems similar to Jukebox [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000035#characters|Opulence]],
    a revival of Zoom Script by Jason Walcott. The initials are similar, though modified
    (perhaps), and the lower case, except for the r style, matches quite well. That
    seemed to be the best match I could locate.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
