body: "\r\nBack in the OS9 days, there was this brilliant little utility which allowed
  you to just drag a bunch of non-installed fonts onto it, and it would give you an
  instant preview of the families. Since this utility (I think it was called Font
  Gander) hasn\u2019t been around for at least 10 years, I was just wondering whether
  someone here knew of something equal in functionality. I know I haven\u2019t found
  anything as of yet.\r\n\r\nOn a sidenote, I find it really odd that an app like
  FontExplorerPro doesn\u2019t support this functionality (without adding the scanned/opened
  fonts to its database, that is).\r\n\r\n\r\nAny suggestion would be much appreciated,\r\n\r\n\r\nyoshi"

  body: I use NexusFont, but to see non-installed fonts in it you need to specify
    a directory they're in. On the other hand, if you unzip all your font folders
    to one directory (or its subdirectories) they'll turn up immediately.

    very well...

  body: It's no Font Gander, but Mac's built-in Quick Look previews are at least better
    than the tiny non-resizable windows spawned by Font Book. And, as the name implies,
    relatively fast. It handles multiple selections, and Option+Space opens the preview
    in full screen.
