    The uppercase seems from a different typeface than the lowercase.\r\nBut, since
    they\u2019re used for setting authors\u2019 names too, there very well could be
    one or two actual fonts involved."

  body: The book description mentions a 1952 Buick and the fonts look like chrome
    scripts. Possibly it is something based on old Buick logos.
