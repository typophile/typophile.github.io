  body: "I assume you are asking about the Latin letters. I think those look like
    one of Hans Eduard Meier's calligraphic fonts, such as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/barbedor/|Barbedor]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/syndor/|Syndor]]. I'm having trouble seeing
    your image details well enough, but I lean towards Barbedor.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
