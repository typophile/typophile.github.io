  body: 'I suppose WEFT should run under Vitual PC, we&#39;ve not tested it. But as
    the WEFT release notes reveal, Mac IE&#39;s support for the format is flaky to
    say the least &#40;non existent in recent versions&#41;. Anyhow the guys to talk
    to are em2-solutions in Sweden. They&#39;ve implemented their own code for creating
    EOT&#39;s - essentially to sell a serve-side EOT creation solution for use on
    non-Windows based servers. <BR> <BR>Best of luck!  '
