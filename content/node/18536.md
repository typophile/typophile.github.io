body: "Hello everybody.\r\n\r\nI'm searching for a display type (maybe a script?!)
  that looks slutty (uups! Sorry!) and is from the 70s. Last point is not a must-have.
  First I thought of Bello. But I think it looks a bit too friendly and is not bold
  enough!? Is there a font that the sex-business-industry preferred in the 70s!? Hope
  that you can help me.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\nSteven"
