body: "I found this interesting. I came across this document for the first time yesterday
  and it struck me that many of us use the term 'OpenType' incorrectly according to
  Microsoft's trademark guidelines. Particularly, I think that we often use the phrase
  'OpenType fonts', where the guidelines counsel this is incorrect and that 'OpenType-based
  fonts' or 'OpenType-formatted fonts' is correct.\r\nI'm curious to find out how
  strictly others try to follow these guidelines and and when you might disregard
  these guidelines."

    consistent in deploying these guidelines:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec140/recom.htm\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/devanagari/intro.mspx\r\n&c."

  body: "I think it\u2019s probably best to avoid the hyphenates. It reads like marketing-speak
    or technical pedantry, neither of which is especially inviting to end users, who
    probably understand that OpenType-formatted fonts, Opentype-based fonts, and OpenType
    fonts are all the same thing. Keeping a human face on fonts is important if we
    want designers to think of type designers as people trying to earn a living and
    not faceless corporations raking in money from stockpiles of computer-generated
    IP."

  body: "Si Daniels, bless his heart, tried to remind people of these guidelines in
    the first few years, but I'm sure he's given up now. As James says, it's really
    not important unless there's a potential for misunderstanding. Another example:
    Apple refers to the iPhone like it's a person: \"don't eat iPhone\" but even the
    most Apple-savvy journalists say \"the iPhone\". No big whoop.\r\n\r\nBut you're
    at Adobe now, Paul! What do their guidelines say?"

  body: "The guidelines really say to use a hyphen like that? Adobe's lawyers would
    have a cow every time somebody tried to take a trademark and turn it into a hyphenated
    term like that.\r\n\r\nHuh.\r\n\r\nT"
