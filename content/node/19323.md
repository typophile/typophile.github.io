body: I am a college senior about to graduate at the end of May and am currently putting
  together my final thesis.  My thesis is a book of essays and photographs on the
  Florida Everglades and this weekend I will be doing the final layout.  While I already
  have the design in mind I have no idea on where to start on picking a font.  I would
  love some suggestions on what resources to look at that will help me with this process.  I
  realize fonts are typically a very personal choice so I am not really looking for
  a "use this" but rather some information (or link to an essay) explaining how people
  make these decisions.  Thanks for your help and I look forward to hearing your responses.

  body: "Hi, Drew.\r\n\r\nFonts can or may be a personal choice but they are also
    helping to communicate something, so it is important to bear in mind the content
    and subject matter of the text you are setting (which you already are, since you
    mention these), as well as the audience that will be reading it.\r\n\r\nOne thing
    you can do to get started (perhaps you have already done this) is look at existing
    books on the same subject and see what font choices their designers made -- not
    to blindly copy, but to see what you think works or doesn't work in those examples.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing you could do is make a list of the different functions the texts in your
    thesis will have. For example, you will have body text, but probably there are
    also titles and subtitles, and perhaps captions for the photographs. You may want
    just one font, in a range of weights, for all of these... or perhaps two fonts
    -- one for titling, the other for body text, to give a simple example. With a
    list of functions you can have a better idea of what you need to look for.\r\n\r\nI
    hope these suggestions don't sound too obvious!"

  body: "Drew\r\n\r\nI am sure this is going to get me kicked off the list but if
    you are doing a thesis, use Courier. I'd also recommend it for resumes. Avoid
    \"personal choices\" for informational documents such as these. I once remember
    being on a job search panel, and an applicant who had sent in a very appealingly
    designed resume got kicked off just for that reason. You are going to be judged
    on the information you present not on how you present it. And, how you present
    it can actually be detrimental (to you) if it does not conform to the norm."

    you want something restrained for a thesis or resume at least go with Palatino,
    Garamond, Times, a real font.

  body: "Thanks for the help everyone.  \r\n\r\nBieler and Pattyfab:\r\n  Part of
    my thesis is in fact the design aspect.  I am submitting a very nontraditional
    project as it is in fact a book, more than half of which will be photos.  The
    book will be laid out as if it is a photo book purchased in a store.  That's why
    I am trying to be careful in my font selection.\r\n\r\nRicardo:\r\n  Thanks for
    the help.  Here are the different sections I am going to be using text for and
    I will have to do some thinking on how I want each displayed.\r\n\r\nBody text
    - Text of each essay, nearly half the book (~50-75 pages)\r\nChapter Title - Part
    1, Part 2, etc\r\nChapter Subtitle - Title of each chapter (The Everglades)\r\nPhoto
    Title - Title and location of each photograph.  Currently set up in Small Caps\r\nPhoto
    Caption - Currently set up in italics and is smaller than body text.  Typically
    a few sentences describing the photo.  \r\n\r\nI will post a link to a sample
    page w/ a PDF in the morning when I can get access to a full version of Acrobat.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for the help and I look forward to learning more about this process.  I
    will definately spend some time looking through other photography books this week.\r\n\r\nDrew\r\n\r\n----------\r\nDrew

  body: "pattyfab\r\n\r\nI do have to ask this question. Based on your suggestions,
    has a thesis or resume proved fruitful for you using the \"real fonts\" you suggest?
    Also, Courier, by the way, is a real typeface. And despite its disdane among contemporary
    graphic designers (?) it does have a bit of a distinguished history to it. Personal
    taste in this matter is of little concern here since that is what you are trying
    to avoid.\r\n\r\nIf I am to send a manuscript to a publisher it is still going
    to be in Courier. They are not going to be concerned about how clever I am in
    my choice of typeface. In fact, it gets in the way of judgement."

  body: "Gerald, I think Courier would be appropriate if this is a resquirement for
    theses, but otherwise not, especially in conjunction with photographs. As this
    evidently has a strong design component, you should look for what best complements
    the photos. \r\n\r\nWhatever you choose, test with the photos as these are going
    to dominate visually, and should. The font should be a supporting actor, not the
    lead.  "

  body: "Beautiful images, Drew. If design is one of the aspects of your thesis, then
    I agree that Palatino or Garamond would be good choices for the text.\r\n\r\nIf
    you will be using small caps, be sure to get a font that has \"true\" small caps
    as opposed to picking the \"small caps\" style in your layout program (same goes
    for \"bold\" and \"italic\" settings -- use a font that has these weights as part
    of the font package). Here's an example of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino/small-caps-and-old-style-figures/\">Palatino
    Small Caps</a>. (And here is the whole range of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/palatino/\">Linotype
    Palatino</a> weights, also by way of illustration.)"

  body: "Ricardo,\r\n  Thanks for all your help.  What is the benefit of using a Small
    caps weight rather than the \"CASE\" option under styles in InDesign?  I appear
    to have both Palatino Linotype and Garamond but dont have a Small Caps weight
    for either.  As a college student who has already thrown all of his money at this
    project I am also wondering if there are any free options.  \r\n\r\nHere is a
    link to a temp layout done with Palatino Linotype and showing all of the different
    uses.  Just for context, the book is a 10\" square and this is a two page spread.

  body: "Drew, I am, shamefully, still something of an InDesign newbie. When I advised
    against using Small Caps, Italic and Bold styles rather than the actual weights
    in the font menu, I was referring to programs like QuarkXPress, which \"fake\"
    those styles -- the faked styles don't always print the way they look onscreen.
    Maybe someone else here can tell you how InDesign handles these things -- from
    the evidence of the PDF it <em>looks</em> alright, but better to be sure.\r\n\r\nAs
    for your layout, you have not asked for a crit, but I agree with timd; it will
    look better if you don't indent the first line of the photo caption on the lefthand
    page (the same applies to the first paragraph of your main text on the facing
    page -- you could start it with a drop cap, or with the first few words in small
    caps, to give a couple of suggestions). And one more thing about the caption:
    it might look better if the parentheses around those unitalicized names were also
    not italicized... right now they look like they are running into the text... Sorry
    to get all anal on you.  :-)"

  body: I do not know if it is the best option to make captions in Small Caps. Small
    Caps seems to work better for sub-headings or in some cases the headings themselves.
    In this instance I would make the caption text italic but keep it the same size
    as the text on the right. And then I would play around with the idea of making
    the heading small caps at the same size as the text and drop the saturation of
    the overall text to about 90% so it is not overpowering. I apologize if you are
    not after a critique though.

    I have already changed this layout a bit, moving around the photo title and captions.

    you get all the words right! Once you got the font family, styles and the template
    the rest is easy. \r\n\r\nI agree with the earlier suggestions that Palatino and
    (Adobe) Garamond would be more than suitable (and economical) for setting your
    thesis/book in.\r\n\r\nIt seems that you've used \"faux\" Small Caps (SC) in InDesign,
    they don't look quite right. The problem with \"faux\" SC is that they're not
    weighted/designed proportionally to the regular/or corresponding weight. For this
    reason alone, I suggest you purchase the single SC weight of your chosen face.
    It should not be expensive if you've already got the other weights as you have
    with Palatino and Garamond.\r\n\r\nAgain, good luck. :^) "
