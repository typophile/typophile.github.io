  body: "How many times have you posted this question? I've seen it in at least two
    other forum sections.\r\n\r\nIn Illustrator, make a large area of your screentone
    pattern. Put it under your text. Select both the text and pattern and \"Make Clipping
    Mask\". (You might need to have converted the text to outlines first.)\r\n\r\nYou
    can do it with the screentone pattern above the text but it seems you need to
    make it into a Compound Path first.\r\n\r\nI use a fairly old version of Illustrator,
    from CS1, so there might be other ways in newer versions."

  body: "What a coinkidink: Just this morning, I was noodling a project that will
    require a good technique for achieving this effect.\r\n\r\nI see two solutions
    proposed here and in the link above, and, unfortunately for me, neither seems
    really elegant. One can either create a halftone in Photoshop (which leaves us
    with a raster image) and optionally Live Trace it in Illustrator (which leaves
    us with irregular shapes), or one can buy an expensive plug-in.\r\n\r\nI don't
    mean to belittle the talent that goes into developing that plug-in (it looks really
    impressive), but the prospect of buying it for a single project isn't appealing
    to me.\r\n\r\nIt's unexpected and disappointing that while Photoshop has had this
    functionality for a long time, Illustrator still doesn't seem to. It seems like
    an effect that is inherently more appropriate for vector images.\r\n\r\nWasn't
    there a popular free font in the 90s that did this? It seems like there must be
    another way."

    circles just make them from scratch, starting with a single dot and using the
    Move/Copy funtion. Gradients take a bit more work as you need to keep expanding
    the paths on different rows."
