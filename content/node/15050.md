  body: "I just went there but there's not much going on. Personally I don't see why
    a chatchannel is neccesary, but that's just my opinion. You never know who is
    hanging around there. My fear would be to get in contact with someone I can't
    verify in the right context. \r\nI think Typophile is a good place to get to know
    the right people and than, if both see the need for it, exchange an ICQ, MSN,
    .MAC or any other account. With the right software you can than also join a multi-user
    conversation. \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n*** www.characters.nl

  body: "Strange thread to choose for this. Strange forum also, I guess.\r\n: )\r\nSince
    I'm sure you'd prefer a legal version, a set of Gill Sans (MT) has been bundled
    with MS Office for some time."

    you aware of the caliber of persons that are on this site? Many of them are professionals,
    and not just professionals -- but type designers, ex-typographers, designers,
    etc.\r\n\r\nWe have people here who make their livelihood from designing typefaces
    and/or setting type or designing layouts for clients. They have worked hard, and
    they own their own fonts. They have bought them and can use them for the necessary
    jobs in front of them.\r\n\r\nWhat you are asking someone here to do is abet you
    in stealing. I think not!"

  body: efnet ... brings back memories. But like others, I don't see a real need for
    real-time chatting with the person who happens to be online at the time. I find
    threaded messages like this forum to meet my needs.
