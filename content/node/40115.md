  looking for a font where the number 2 makes the first (blue) circle and the 2 last
  rings (red-green) make up the 8.\r\n\r\nIt should look a bit like this\r\n\r\n[[http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/8121/2008pi4.png]]\r\n\r\nDoes
  anybody know about a font with a '2' like that?\r\n\r\nIf there are any ideas out
  there on how to connect the red and green rings to make the 8 mor obvious, those
  are welcome too!\r\n\r\nTIA\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n"
