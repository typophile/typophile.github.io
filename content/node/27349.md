    then you probably don't want it in your portfolio.  Or, you should spend the time
    to fix what you aren't happy with.\r\n\r\nIf you want more comments on the actual
    piece, you'll need to tell us a little more about it."

  body: "first of all thanks for the reply.\r\nAgree with you...but some time you
    don't like something in the project but peoples  are happy with that..in that
    case you can't work on that project further..same thing happened with me..I made
    this poster for my schools film and vedeo batch 2004(10 students batch). They
    were screening their first films and they called it 'Spots'. They told me to make
    a poster for this occassion. I made this and they liked it and get printed.\r\n\r\nEveryone
    told me that they liked the poster..but I need a feedback as a typographers point
    of view.\r\n\r\nthanks again\r\nsatya\r\n"

  body: 'Maybe it''s a little bit difficult to read ''spots''. This is because two
    items are adding confusion: tipography chosen and the place where you place it.
    I think if you change one of these things you''ll like it more.'

    rips etc, but then I see smiling people.\r\nIf asked whether this was deliberate
    design (read:developed via a thought process) or a pure stylistic attempt (read:
    without much if any purpose) I'd say stylistic attempt.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

  body: "The colours in the top version work better with the photography, but the
    lower iteration seems to be more faithful to the concept of ripping a paste-up
    off a concrete wall. \r\n\r\nTruncating the top of the letterforms does introduce
    a lot of ambiguity there. As Tim has shown, it might be more effective for you
    to rearrange the type or layout to avoid that end. Also, whether or not Frederic
    Goudy actually did say it, the tracked-out lowercase type (particularly at the
    top) really bothers me. It could work more effectively as a coherent line without
    capitalization or parentheses\u2014 remember that as the designer, you can often
    reformat copy within reason."
