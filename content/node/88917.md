  or not.\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? The 'w' part is what im having trouble
  with i think.\r\nThe logo is for an Archive organisation, and the idea was wanting
  to go from a serif 't' to a sans 'a' but i've tried different versions too.\r\n\r\nAny
  feedback would be great,\r\nMany thanks   \r\nToby"

  body: "t looks like 1 and, as you say, w is invisible. I think you're trying too
    hard to make a single glyph out of three.\r\nAnd, more than from serif to sans
    it would be easier going from handwritten to printed."
