body: "Has anyone got nice examples to share of current books that have horizontal
  spine text, preferably set flush left / ragged right? I'm aware of the slews of
  classic books with centered horizontal text on the spine, but I'm looking for more
  current examples.\r\n\r\nIs this more popular with nonfiction than fiction? If so
  why?\r\n\r\nAlso, any good reasons against doing this sort of thing (assuming of
  course that it works without making the text too small and/or causing uncomfortable
  breaks)?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    modern/design-y, so maybe it depends on the novel too."

    up with. I'm sure you'll make it look great.

    about it, other than the inability to scream DAN BROWN or similia using all available
    space (mitigated by the better readability of horizontal text), the only other
    issue I can think of is with the type of binding. A used paperback book, one that
    was actually read, tend to develop vertical cracks along the spine. Vertical text
    would appear somewhat stenciled, but still legible until a certain point. The
    risk with horizontal text would be the cracks deleting single letters."

  body: "Interesting. I've been thinking about this as well of late. It seems that
    we've become quite used to tilting our heads (or our brains) to be able to read
    vertical text on a spine, especially when it reads from top to bottom (in North
    America). But on websites, magazines, or other collateral, it's not recommended
    nor is there a convention established.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know when vertically
    displayed text became a standard in book publishing or is it just a matter of
    longer titles and shorter books requiring it?"

    to see if anybody will :-). It is rather uncommon, but I tend to think that's
    a good thing, in terms of making it stand out."
