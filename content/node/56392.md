body: "In a previous thread I wrote: \"My concept of what we should be doing in type
  design is that, at least in the text-type domain, we should be exploring feature
  manipulation / norm-violations that promote or enhance rapid automatic visual wordform
  resolution in reading.\r\n\r\nHrant replied: \"As long as we make sure not to leave
  the Old Continent eh?\r\nCoast-hugging is dead; we need our astrolabe.\"\r\n\r\n[The
  issue here is chirography, or what I've been designating chirographic paraphrase
  in type design.]\r\n\r\nI didn't really want to dwell on this in the context of
  the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/cms/node/56293\">Learning Handwriting</a> thread,
  but I do want to clarify my stance. The \"my concept\" statement was an attempt
  to articulate in my own way, a common ground between myself and Hrant. In his reply
  Hrant imputes an undisclosed (by me) qualification (\u201Cas long as...\u201D) that
  I personally don't make. I don't do type design, but I'm interested in every exploration,
  including Hrants. My interest in Legato should testify to this. Legato goes beyond
  paraphrase. My analysis of it in several places on typophile was an attempt to measure
  \u2018in what ways.\u2019\r\n\r\nHrant promotes breaking the contrapuntal links
  that are at the bottom of chirographic paraphrase, because he thinks this will initiate
  a quantum leap in type design's ability to enhance \u2014 in my terms \u2014 rapid
  automatic visual wordform resolution in reading, by improving the notanic integrity
  of words. I think this is an interesting proposition, but I don't think the logic
  behind how Hrant <em>wants to go about it</em> is as ironclad as Hrant believes
  or simple common sense, and I think the negations Hrant invokes to make it seem
  critical at this time are more categorical than warranted."
