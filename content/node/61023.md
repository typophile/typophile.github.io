  body: "I know it's available on dafont. That's not what I'm asking. \r\n\r\nI'd
    like to know what font people think it's based on. I've looked at a few sans serif
    fonts but haven't come up with anything similar so far.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Titling Gothic, like Alternate Gothic and Knockout, is similar but not the
    same. Some letters look identical but others, especially the \"G\" and the \"K,\"
    are very different. \r\n\r\nAlso, overall his letters look a bit more boxy, or
    squarish, than any of the fonts mentioned here.\r\n\r\nThese are a good start,
    nonetheless. So thanks a lot!"
