body: "Hello all, I'm new here and very happy to find you with thanks to Thomas Phinney
  for pointing the way. Most of my font creation experience is with Type 1 PC fonts,
  but I'll try and contribute all I can as I learn the OTF format.\r\n\r\nI'm currently
  updating a Type 1 font we created a loooonnng time ago by opening the Type 1 files
  in FontLab 4 to create an OTF that we'll use in InDesign for Windows and pass off
  to a designer for InDesign on the Mac.\r\n\r\nInDesign, however, isn't using the
  kern pairs in the OTF font. If I generate new PC Type 1 files from FontLab InDesign
  uses the kern pairs, but not in the OTF font. Other programs including Word 2003
  are seeing the kern pairs.\r\n\r\nI have a hunch it may be because InDesign is \"smarter\"
  with the OTF than the other programs, but I've not been able to find what it's looking
  at that is preventing the kerning.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nKen"

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nFL4 is not really a good choice any more and if possible, you
    should update to FLS5.\r\nI assume you already have used the \"update kern feature\"
    button in the Kerning Assistance, so that a 'kern' feature shows up in the OpenType
    Panel.\r\nHowever, you also need to add a substitution feature. This can be something
    as simple as\r\n\r\nliga (\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;sub aring by aring;\r\n) liga;\r\n\r\nIt
    doesn't do anything visible, it's just for the sake that it's there. (Please exchange
    the parentheses in the code by braces. Of course this requires that there is an
    'aring' glyph in the font.)"

    odd to me that I had to add the substitution as well. Is that a bug in FL4 or
    something with the OTF format.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: In addition to this issue with the kern feature, you also need to be sure
    InDesign isn't using it's own kerning algorithm. Set kerning to "Metrics" rather
    than "Optical". Optical kerning in InDesign means the built-in kerning is being
    ignored, and the kerning engine of InDesign is adjusting things on the fly. The
    kerning (and general fit) of everything under Optical kerning also changes depending
    on the size you set your type, so for type designers doing fit and kerning testing,
    you should avoid InDesign's Optical kerning.

    It was a bug (fixed in CS3) in CoolType, a library for enumerating and rendering
    fonts used by InDesign."

    -- <cite>Neither.</cite>\r\n\r\nSorry if my \"better update to FLS5\" in this
    context suggested that it's an FL4 issue.\r\n\r\nThe fact that 'kern' feature
    is not recognized in InDesign is one thing, as Miguel said. (Good to hear this
    is fixed in the new version!)\r\n\r\nThe \"update to FLS5\" suggestion is unrelated
    to this.\r\nSome things have been much refined in FLS5, like the way FL4 generates
    font names for OTFs, or the way FL4 generates the 'kern' feature. -- However,
    these are <cite>not serious</cite> issues if I correctly understand your description
    of your use of FontLab. E.g. it seems you don't use classes for kerning, and in
    this case the 'kern' feature which FL4 generates should be ok.\r\nBut then, the
    update is a real bargain ... (If you don't plan to include OT features in future,
    TypeTools 3 looks like a great tool too. Fewer options, thus less confusing than
    FLS5 may be at times. I just had a quick look into the demo yesterday.)\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "> <em>The fact that \u2018kern\u2019 feature is not recognized in InDesign</em>\r\n\r\nWhat
    was happening was that GPOS data was being treated as a subset of GSUB data. So
    if no GSUB table was included in the font, the GPOS table would be ignored.\r\nInterestingly,
    if the font was processed through VOLT, the bug wouldn't be triggered, because
    VOLT always creates a GSUB table, even if it ends up empty."

  body: I have a question which is partially related to this discussion. I'm trying
    to kern a hebrew font in fontlab (I know how to do it in VOLT, but for my purposes,
    fontlab is easier). The tip on GSUBs helped the kerning take, but it only works
    properly on som pairs. With others, instead of kerning the correct letters, it
    kerns the one before the pair. I don't see any clear pattern. What could be causing
    this? Also, in VOLT, you can control the values of both letters in the pair, can
    the same be done in fontlab?
