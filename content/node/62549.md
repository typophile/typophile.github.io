  body: "It's a modified Caslon variant. The scripty capitals look a bit like Dorchester
    Script with a few other scripty additions; the ampersands is def. not Dorchester,
    the F and B look like it.\r\n\r\nGood luck..."

  body: "The textface seems to be Caslon 540. So Ben\u2019s suggestion makes sense
    (\r\nCaslon Italic With Swashes).\r\n"

  body: that is one hell of an ampersand... it's so flourished-out, it almost doesn't
    look like an ampersand.
