body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nAssumptions: regular/normal [[weight]] is slightly (but noticeably)
  lighter that text/book weight fonts. Regular/normal weight tends to look anemic
  and high contrast at text sizes.\r\n\r\nI assume that the text weight is suitable
  for longer passages of text, as in body text, and probably optimized for sizes 8-12
  points.\r\n\r\nThen when is it appropriate to use the normal/regular weight in design
  work. What's it for?\r\n\r\nI ask this because of the way some FontFont packages
  are divided. Examples are Kievit 1 & 2, Milo 1 & 2, Max 1 & 2 and others. In these
  packages book/text and regular/normal are separated.\r\n\r\nSo what choice does
  the designer who may not have the money nor want the overhead of having both packages
  do?\r\nIts not as simple as roman, italic, bold and bold italic.\r\n\r\nAnd then
  to make matters more interesting take a look a Emigre Vista. In the \"Love Letters\"
  catalog the sample texts are set in the regular weight. The book weight is actually
  lighter than the regular weight. Go figure.\r\n\r\nSo what is the intended function
  of regular/normal weight? And is the book/text weight really important?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for helping ( I need it ),\r\n\r\nMike Diaz"

    think normal is a stupid name for a weight anyway. \r\n\r\nIMHO there is so much
    variety in font styles/weights that you should go with what intuitively looks
    best, and the only way to figure that out is to print it on a high dpi printer.
    Clearly when a font has a \"display\" weight that is designed for larger sizes
    and headlines. I am frequently frustrated by the (seemingly) arbitrary way fonts
    are packaged, usually I want to mix and match but that's sometimes more expensive.
    As in, I'd rather have book and regular but maybe not light and bold."

  body: "This is also a question I wrestle with as a type designer. As far as things
    already on the market, there is no definitive answer. Frutiger has the best idea
    with his numbering system. You at least know which weight is bolder just from
    the number.\r\nThe terms Regular, Normal, text, book, light are sometimes used
    interchageably and sometimes have a clear meaning. I have also seen book look
    lighter than regular in some families. Patty is right, you really have to look
    at samples set as text blocks to be able to make up your mind. Designers who have
    created cuts for specific uses are giving you the most help in chosing. Many of
    the larger superfamilies have a cut for text, subhead, caption, and display. The
    cuts are optically sized to fit the intended job. Often, it is not just lightness
    that changes, it is usually contrast, xheight, and width as well. A caption cut
    will be a bit bolder, more extended, higher xheight, and have a bit less contrast
    than a text weight.\r\nAnother consideration is printing and paper stock. A more
    absorbent text paper may print a bit darker than a coated stock. Looking at a
    typical phone book page will give you the extreme.\r\n\r\nI wonder what the typical
    Typophiler would say about text vs. book weight? Maybe it is poll time?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "One thing to keep in mind whenever you see <em>regular, text, book,</em>
    and <em>normal</em> suffix type weights is that <strong>NOT ALL</strong> type
    families or expanded weight families were conceived or developed as a whole package.\r\n\r\nMany
    revival families with book or text weights, as well as expansions to initial releases
    of digitized font families were added <em>afterwards</em>, sometimes years or
    decades later, often to correct or enhance design of <em>regular</em> weight specifically
    for book/magazine publishing. The necessity to have additional weights often came
    as responses to market requirements.\r\n\r\nSince there are no standards associated
    with weight naming and actual type densitiy (not all text, book or regular weights
    are comparable to each other from type family to type family), you really have
    no way of determining what looks or works best for your projects other than testing
    the actual output. So follow what Patty and Chris suggest above and use your own
    judgement.\r\n\r\n"

    me, as pointed out, to generate test prints to determine the suitable package.\r\n\r\nMikey

    of a font that just can't bring itself to be called Roman, often in a Sans that
    was never meant for body copy. Text is for setting long blocks of text as opposed
    to ad copy. Book often seems to mean that some foundry is milking a cash cow and
    churning out more weights of a font than are really necessary, ie. AG Buch. "
