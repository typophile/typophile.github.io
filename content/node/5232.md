  body: It used to be that the system fonts per se were required. As of 10.3.x you
    can now use the Type 1 versions of those fonts instead without problems, but you
    do need &#42;some&#42; version of Helvetica &#40;and perhaps others&#41; installed.

  body: thx a lot, i dont&#39;t know for sure what the reason was exactly, but i guess
    it was helvetica. when using the &#34;fix duplicates&#34; command it removed obviously
    the required version.  <BR>  <BR>

  body: Phew! this has been a long-haul pain in the butt to upgrade to Panther, and
    I&#39;m wierdly relieved to hear that others are having problems, no offense.
    My Address Book gets corrupted; I don&#39;t know if there are conflicts between
    Font Reserve and Font Book; and certain fonts turn themselves off and on without
    my wanting it. I installed Adobe CS soon after Panther, and don&#39;t know it
    Adobe has some fonts load automatically.  <BR> <BR>Over the years, I&#39;ve used
    Font Reserve, Suitcase, and ATM Deluxe and am sad that ATM Deluxe no longer exists,
    as it was my fave. With nearly 10,000 fonts, this is all a big headache. Should
    I disable FontBook? Any insights, tips?

  body: Has anyone seen this issue. Type 3 fonts from various sources. Seen in OSX.2
    &amp; X.3. Seen in all font Mgmt utils and in design applications. Garbled mapping
    of characters. A previously working font can go bad due to a temporary addition
    of a client font with the same name. It does not have to be turned on. I have
    seen this on multiple machines. Below Bold faces fine, Light have lost their map.
    Replacing the outline may or may not resolve the issue depending on OS X&#39;s
    mood at the time <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    alt="OS X Font problem illustrated"> <BR> <BR>Face appears to lose font map due
    to conflict. Does anyone have a solution? It is impossible to eliminate fonts
    from various sources due to being a pre-press provider. I have work arounds but
    would rather have a solution. <BR> <BR>Thanks
