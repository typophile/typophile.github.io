		<div class="commentbody">When you kern you&rsquo;re adjusting the distance between characters so the spacing looks uniform. Since characters have different shapes, some must be closer together than others to create spacing that appears uniform. There is a subjective element to it, but bad kerning is usually pretty obvious. If you Google &ldquo;how to kern&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll find articles that give tips. You could also post an example of type you&rsquo;ve kerned to get suggestions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes, kerning is a matter of personal taste. Which is not the same as saying anything is correct. Kerning is a matter of harmonious spacing, that is, everything needs to work well together. Often, a change to a kerning pair shows a difference in one&rsquo;s notion of proper character fit, so a change in one kern value will lead to others.</p>
<p>Occasionally though, changing the kerning of a single glyph does not affect other spatial relationships &ndash; witness Slimbach&rsquo;s notion of the proper kerning of an apostrophe versus what other equally skilled people deem correct.</p>
<blockquote>Professional type designers spend a lot of time carefully spacing and kerning typefaces to look just so. Generally, any extra input from the end-user is not needed</blockquote>
<p>Extra &ldquo;input&rdquo; needed? No, but quite often fixes are needed by the &ldquo;professional user.&rdquo; And by that I mean the professional type designer gets things wrong, usually by omission, occasionally by error. I&rsquo;m not speaking of a difference in preference about spatial relationships here.</p>
<p>But there is no need to give the &ldquo;professional type designer&rdquo; input. Many &ldquo;professional type designers&rdquo; don&rsquo;t live in a world populated by sentient authors, editors, typesetters, and readers. Very hard to convince them otherwise &ndash; usually a wasted effort. Just fix things and get on with life.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>This is particularly true in your situation, a logo. Presumably, there aren&rsquo;t many letters involved. A type desigenr, working on an entire font, has to make compromises in order to get all the letters to work well together. With your rather limited set, and a purpose that isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;continuous reading,&rdquo; decisions will likely be different. You can can still get things wrong, of course, but that&rsquo;s different than claiming there is a single &ldquo;right.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Personal taste yes, but within the culture of professional typography—which encompasses the efforts of type designers, kern algorithm programmers and typographers.</p>
<p>There are, and have been, various conventions and philosophies of how to space letters. Here’s an example of “tight but not touching” from the 1960s:
<img src="/images/old-images/Pepsi_1968_3905.png" alt="">
If you decide that the time is right to revive such spacing in your wordmark, you will have to do it manually, because neither built-in metrics nor InDesign’s “Optical” will produce this result.</p>
<p>Not only should you consider each individual letterspace in a wordmark, and manually kern where you see ﬁt, but you might also consider modifying letter shapes for improved overall color.</p>
<p>Herb Lubalin’s masthead for Avant Garde magazine (which begat the typeface) originated, I surmise, from him working with one of his favorite types, Futura. I made the example below to show a possible interim stage in his design of the masthead. The idea is that you can only get so far—in certain kinds of wordmark—without going beyond off-the-shelf type.
<img src="/images/old-images/AGs_4209.png" alt="">
My apologies if this old stuff is out-of-date, but it does offer a perspective and, being an extreme, clearly represents the principles involved.</p>
<p>In recent years, many OpenType fonts have been published with alternate glyphs, which enables some customization of wordmarks, without having to “create outlines” in Illustrator.</p>

<p>Another point is, with short copy, it depends on the words themselves. If I were setting</p>
<p>WAWA BOX</p>
<p>in a logo-type environment, kerning between all the letters could be tighter than if the two words were</p>
<p>WARP DRIVE</p>
<p>and certainly tighter than would be appropriate in the font itself, which has to work when setting long runs of text.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Not just personal taste – you might want to loosen kerning for a tiny use and tighten it for giant use just out of production considerations.</p>
<p>It is almost always necessary to consider kerning for headlines to articles too and certain character pairs can cause problems in a document (this is especially true when you encounter something a type designer would not necessarily consider when setting the kerning for example a numeral/letter combination).</p>
<p>I was shown two ways of considering kerning – one is to print it out and turn it round; the other was to partially close eyes and squint at the setting on screen – this reduces the characters to a blur and lets you pick out the space in between.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">What about the word &lsquo;minimum&rsquo; that a lot of typedesigners use to set the white space they like as a basic setting with the typeface and most important the type size involved? By the way, in a logo or in a name (like a movie title) you have to deal with characters as if it where individuals. The concept &lsquo;typeface&rsquo; should not be important. Often in a logo you can alter some characters (although a type designer is often not happy about that) so that you are really creating a logo and not simply a headline or typed title. It has to become a form of its own.
When a typeface is made originally as a textface, often other choices are made according to letterform and use of white than you are dealing with in a logo or movie title.</div>
