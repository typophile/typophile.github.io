  relying on you to help me out. It will be used for a programming language akin to
  CSS.\r\n\r\nSo that's what we currently have:\r\n\r\nhairline 50\r\nthin 100\r\nultralight
  150\r\nextralight 200\r\nlight 300\r\nbook 350\r\nnormal 400\r\nmedium 500\r\nsemibold
  600\r\nbold 700\r\n\r\nHere are the complicate ones:\r\nextrabold\r\nheavy\r\nblack\r\n\r\n1/
  What's the correct order for these 3?\r\n2/ Does ultrablack corresponds to one of
  these? Is it a separate weight?\r\n3/ Which one corresponds to 800? 900?"
