    the style itself is Italian; Two-Line Great Primer is the particular body size
    of the sample shown. \u201CItalian\u201D as a style dates from the early nineteenth
    century, when foundries typically offered a limited range of styles, and is curiously
    distinguished by its horizontal stress, rather than the vertical stress found
    in a truly Italian type such as Bodoni."
