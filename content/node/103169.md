body: "Many of you are interested in issues surrounding open font licensing, so you
  may be interested in how the SIL Open Font License can be used in a web fonts world.
  There are some difficult issues, but after months of discussion with various industry
  representatives, we've come to some conclusions.\r\n\r\nNicolas Spalinger and I,
  the maintainers of the SIL Open Font License, have posted a draft of an update to
  the OFL-FAQ (1.1-update3-draft). Although there are many small clarifications and
  refinements from version 1.1-update2, the main addition is a greatly expanded section
  related to web fonts. There is also a related discussion paper on Web Fonts and
  Reserved Font Names that deals with those issues in even more detail. Comments and
  feedback are welcome.\r\n\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/OFL-FAQ_web_11update3draft\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web_fonts_and_RFNs\r\n\r\nWe
  hope this helps to bring clarity to some of the many difficult issues related to
  web fonts and Reserved Font Names.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nVictor Gaultney\r\nSIL
  International"

    the same reasons. Please explain why. '

  body: "What I say in the web fonts paper is:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>EOT was one of the
    earliest web font formats and did not initially support all of what is needed
    to preserve FE. However, more recent changes in both the format and supporting
    development tools may provide what is needed. Deeper technical analysis of this
    is needed before a judgment can be made about this format.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nUntil
    recently, the only EOT tools available made considerable changes to the font,
    including removing some important key data, and the tools did not allow otherwise.
    The WOFF format and tools, however, can be used in ways that preserve FE (Functional
    Equivalence).\r\n\r\nI suspect that these limitations on EOT, however, may no
    longer be in place given the right tools. I have no conclusive evidence or examples
    of this, or that show that EOT fonts can be built in a way that preserves FE.
    Hence our decision to not take a stand either way for now.\r\n\r\nWe would <strong>very
    much welcome</strong> a clear but thorough technical explanation that shows that
    FE can (or cannot) be preserved, and would happily add that as an appendix to
    the web fonts paper. It would need to show specifically how to preserve FE when
    building EOTs, so that developers can get it right in their tools and build systems.
    <em>Submissions welcome!</em>"

  body: "What particular \"key data\" was removed? Can you give some examples (or
    an exhaustive list)?\r\n\r\nI think Si Daniels would be the person to be in touch
    with on this."
