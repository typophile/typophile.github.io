  everyone, I have just released my first typeface project for free. Not as good as
  most of the stuff in here but I'm hoping that you'll find it useful in some way.\r\n\r\nYou
  can grab a copy of it here: [[http://www.andrewpaglinawan.com/typeface/QuicksandFamily.zip|Quicksand]]\r\n\r\n"

    I have a question concerning the special characters. I use M$ Word 2007 and the
    strange thing is that the percent character won't show up in the dokument. The
    place where the % should be is simply blank. Has anybody got an idea why this
    happens? Also, if I put in the percent character Word tends to replace the font
    with Times New Roman, as if this specific character was missing in Quicksand.

    \ Furthermore, the wider on the bold font seems perfect for headers/titles.\r\n\r\nI
    suggest you distribute a license with it, so it's a little less vague in terms
    of what you're allowed to do.  Although, I'm always biased to recommend the [[http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl|WTFPL]].\r\n\r\n<strong>Awesome,

  body: "Hi Andrew,\r\nIs this font really free to use for commercial. Can we use
    it to logo presentation in logo contest?\r\nAnd if we win the logo contest, do
    we have to pay the font? Because 100 % logo creation include the font given to
    the contest holder.\r\nDo the buyer (CH) need to pay you after take your font
    use it?"

    agree on a price, pay him, then use the font to enter the competition. Also, you
    should mention the font when you submit to the contest, and if you win.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
