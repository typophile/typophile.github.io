  to my home country of Malaysia, I found it fascinating how dominating the usage
  of Sans Serif is in the West.  Furthermore, usage seems to be completely limited
  to the following fonts or their derivatives;\r\n\r\nArial\r\nHelvetica\r\nMyriad\r\nDIN
  / Blender / etc.\r\nGill Sans\r\n\r\nEvery website and corporate signage appears
  to be using at least one of the above.  I once spoke to a typographer from a Big
  Agency that will remain nameless who essentially said the above are all you need
  for readability from a long distance, and as such these fonts will continue to dominate.
  \ Serif gets dated quickly and is not good for prominent signage display.\r\n\r\nI
  found the above statement fascinating, and I was wondering what your opinions were
  on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKen Kamal \u2014 Branding Strategy and Design\r\nhttp://brandlibra.com\r\ninfo@brandlibra.com\r\n"

    here (and in general too much uniformity) not least as a result of ignorance concerning
    readability. But I'm surprised -in a good way- that you say Malaysia is better
    in that respect. Do you mean in Latin-alphabet usage, or Jawi?\r\n\r\nBTW, try
    to ignore those who cannot tolerate dissent of their culture.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Nick, thought you raised some excellent examples of corporate typefaces,
    and I do concede Real Newspapers have retained their independence even when switching
    to smaller formats which is excellent - although, I believe this is an attempt
    to disassociate from tabloids as much as anything. :)\r\n\r\nHowever, I think
    the point I make about the use of Sans Serif is still valid when referring to
    any recent rebranding or development in the UK. Look at M&S, Abbey (admittedly
    they dropped that disastrous logo and went back to Serif), o2, or anything done
    by Pentagram (not to slur them either, although I do question that \"proprietary\"
    font for the John Lewis logo).  Looking at the buntings hiding building sites
    really did hone the point that Helvetica is undead.   \r\n\r\nI would have loved
    to see fonts like Baskerville used in more contemporary contexts, but apart from
    historic tourist attractions and a lone Ogilvy and Mather business card, it seemed
    to be thin on the ground.\r\n\r\nhhp, I think it impacted on me in Malaysia when
    I returned to a world of Jawi, Arabic, Chinese text and calligraphy, Sanskrit
    and so forth.  Corporate Identities often have more than one language or typeface
    (sometimes three or four), and even in application of the Latin alphabet Serif
    fonts are well entrenched here.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is not true of English
    newspapers in Malaysia, where Sans Serif completely dominates and everything looks
    and reads like the Sun (without the nudity).  Kerning is also non existent here
    (although, admittedly, I have been guilty of this cardinal sin too)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    articles about the dominance of a few sans faces, and tried to explain it. Some
    of these articles (eg The Face of Uniformity) are on my website, shinntype.com.\r\n\r\nThere's
    also a photo-essay I did on Helvetica in the UK:\r\nhttp://typographi.com/001009.php\r\n\r\nI
    just thought your saying \"completed limited...\" was an overstatement, especially
    when I'm comparing Canada with the UK, and Canada doesn't have that large dimension
    of exciting proprietary typefaces that there are in the UK. Notwithstanding M&S!"

    give us a break from your banal generalizations of \"culture\" and consider real
    people? What I \"won't tolerate\" (although that's your usual exaggerated inflamatory
