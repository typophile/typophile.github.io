body: Hello all, I've recently acquired a beautiful monograph of Dan Winters', released
  last year by Aperture. The book is set with a very beautiful didone face that I
  can't quite put my finger on. What's mostly giving me fits is the swash style in
  the italics. A <a href="http://www.spd.org/0809WIFFDANW611.jpg">cover</a> image
  and <a href="http://www.spd.org/images/blog/0809WIFFDANW586.jpg">interior spread</a>,
  for your consideration. Many thanks!

    I couldn't ID by sight, and Identifont, WhatTheFont, and the Serif Font ID Guide
    didn't get me an exact match.
