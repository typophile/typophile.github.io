    X]] is the best on the Mac side.

    fonts is to duplicate the Fonts directory and then delete most of them form the
    main directory.\r\n\r\nHappy Trashing with Flowers\r\n\r\n"

  body: I was going to use the Vox-ATypI classification, but I think it'll end up
    taking to much of my time. I have them organised by foundry atm using smartsets.

  body: "The Extensis guys said that they manually organize huge lists of categorizations
    of fonts for their software font managers. I don't have Suitcase Fusion, but I
    seem to recall that it worked decently when I used it on a friend's computer.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, I use Font Explorer X.\r\n\r\nIt does have smart sets, but I have
    yet to figure out how to get them to work the way I want them to."

  body: "The problem with the VOX system is that it does a great job of classifying
    classical fonts. But what do you do with something like the IM Fell fonts or a
    rough script from Veer?\r\n\r\nA generic \"Display\" category? Lame.\r\n\r\n "
