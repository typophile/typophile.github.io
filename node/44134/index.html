  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>As a student, something I encounter often is the notion that whenever possible long sections of text should be broken up with lots of invented section breaks. The justification for this is usually something along the lines of “people don’t like to read” or ”nobody wants to look at all that text.” As someone who has always enjoyed thick books with no pictures, I find these notions irritating and even offensive; I feel that the continuous success of mammoth books from popular authors like Stephen King and J.K. Rowling make it pretty clear that people really don’t need someone else chopping reading into smaller chunks.</p>
<p>Is there really a good typographic reason for breaking text up more often than authors and editors might want? Or is this just a tendency of design professors and writers to throw in extra flourishes (and live vicariously through student work)? Or is it all just part of the trend of dumbing down some areas of popular culture?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, different media have different purposes. If someone wants to read a book, they&rsquo;ll pick up a book they want to read, and they&rsquo;ll read it from beginning to end. Something like a magazine article or an advertisement is trying to hold the attention of a reader who may not be particularly interested in the subject matter and is eager to skip ahead to the next thing. The designer has to try to coax the reader into taking a closer look, or, failing that, to get the reader to absorb some of the intended message just by skimming it before turning the page.</div>

<p>Probably. I remember a design professor on a panel at a national meeting who said it was the designer&rsquo;s responsibility to challenge and excite the reader.</p>
<p>I stood up in the Q&amp;A session &amp; said that if a designer wanted to &ldquo;challenge&rdquo; or &ldquo;excite&rdquo; a reader, he/she should write a book; those were the author&rsquo;s prerogatives. He replied &ldquo;Of course. The designer should check with the author.&rdquo; Perhaps fine advice in school; almost never happens in the real world. Should something like that be needed, it will be the editor, in conversation with the author, who makes the decision.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Magazines often do the &ldquo;break up big blocks&rdquo; thing for differing reasons as Cerulean mentioned. Also, magazines are often read in spurts on subway commutes and doctor&rsquo;s offices. Having stopping points may be an advantage for such uses. The New Yorker is more likely to run long text because it is a readers magazine and the writing is usually quite a bit better than the lifestyle mags that promote &ldquo;10 things your husband really wants (in bed)&rdquo; or &ldquo;101 best bars to pick up babes&rdquo;. Magazines also have plenty of ads and jumps so the reader gets visually jolted around and has to resettle himself with cues like subheads.
Books that are more a reference than a novel need subheads so that a person can find the section they are looking for easier. Things like &ldquo;Linkage adjustments on the 1967 Plymouth Fury&rdquo; may help the scanning gearhead find what he needs.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As Cerulean said, it&rsquo;s all about the context. No, you don&rsquo;t want to break up novel unless you are Jonathan Safran Foer or Dave Eggers. The New York Review of Books and The New Yorker get along just fine with a bare minimum of breaks and/or flourishes. That wouldn&rsquo;t work so well with Lucky or Us Magazines. The main thing is to recognize who your readership is going to be and what is going to best work for them. There are no hard and fast rules.</p>
<p>When you get out into the real world, it is pretty rare for a designer or art director to overrule an editor when it comes to matters of text. You have to have a very good reason for doing it beyond &ldquo;it will look cool&rdquo;. The last thing an editor or author wants to think is that &ldquo;people don&rsquo;t like to read&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I get pissed when I think the designer is being hostile to the text, as in a lot of Phaidon art books where the text is treated as a design element and frequently not so easy on the eyes. But from what I understand that is a rare instance of the art director getting to call the shots (as an editor there has told me).</p>

<p>If you disagree with the principles you are being taught, you could survey current practice and see what is normal in different genres.  Standard practice may not be aesthetically or theoretically pleasing to those who stop to think about it, such as educators, but at the very least it is highly readable to its audience&ndash;it has evolved to be the way it is through a process of natural selection in large cultural systems. It wouldn&rsquo;t look like it does if it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>Has anyone read Chip Kidd&rsquo;s &ldquo;the Cheese Monkeys?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure most know who he is, but in case not, he&rsquo;s pretty much designed every novel cover in the past 10 years.

<p>I think the smaller pages allowed for more places to stop, as well as for the reader to feel slightly more intelligent, that he could read a whole book so quickly. The white space was however almost the same real-estate as the text itself. I&rsquo;d be interested to see the other version(s).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">In editorial design for non-profit agencies, their annual reports and related promo pieces tend to be text-heavy. We cannot assume readers are willing to read the text, so designers use a variety of intermediate devices that either sell the piece or convey the main points without reading body copy&ndash;two-tier headlines (teaser big, info line smaller), pull quotes, section sub-heads, interesting captions. These devices supplement the main text by super-imposing a kind of outline that the reader grasps at a glance. The client wins when the reader gets the message so easily, or at least, when he gets the impression the agency is support-worthy, which is all the agency really needs. This is the justification for using such devices to sell text; in magazines it serves the same function. There&rsquo;s no reason to spurn this method, it&rsquo;s just a question of how intelligently you use the devices available.</div>

<p>Another cliche of Design Professors is that it is the job of the designer to challenge preconceptions, or challenge something, at any rate.</p>
<p>I think this is mostly design professors wanting to make the designer a tool of their own frustrated political activism — whether it conduces with the author&rsquo;s intention or not. &ldquo;Break up the text, insert more pictorial elements&rdquo; is often a disguised way of saying that high literary culture is a thing of the past and good riddens to it. It goes along with unsubstantiated nonsense about 5 minute attention spans.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Most comments here have been referring to the practice as creating <em>breaking</em> points. But another way of looking at this sort of thing is creating <em>entry</em> points. And, as has been stated repeatedly, it all depends upon the material, the audience, and the environment.</p>
<p>Certain types of material (magazines or annual reports, for instance) do benefit from multiple entry points. A reader scanning a magazine may not be attracted by the headline or the topic, but might get hooked in through a photo and caption, or a pull-quote, or a subhead, and before they know it they&rsquo;re actually reading the text. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>Fiction and other sustained narrative genres do not necessarily need these sorts of hooks, and in fact can be disrupted by the practice.</p>
<p>My experience is that good authors, editors, copywriters, etc., understand their genre and the tools of their trade. As such, the text will reflect what&rsquo;s appropriate and the designer should look for cues from the text and the editor.</p>
<p>I have worked in environments where it is collaborative and I can make suggestions to the editor, knowing that we&rsquo;re both after the same thing. But that&rsquo;s different than a blanket statement that says design should always try to break up text and enliven the page; context is everything.</p>

<p>Exactly, Kent, thank you. These &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; devices are needed in a crowded, distracted environment like a magazine, or when a one-purpose publication (like an annual report) crosses a busy desk and needs to win that reader&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>There are tasteful ways to use such devices in books too; I&rsquo;ve done it successfully. Don&rsquo;t spurn the method, just make intelligent use of it.</p>

<p>David Ogilvie addresses the issue of layout in &ldquo;Ogilvy on Advertising&rdquo;. I always recall his tactic, that if it really is impossible to connect, by means of coherent grammar, the points that need to be made in a passage of text, then write it in list form, preferably numbered.</p>

We all have had a teacher or two who has not been inspiring or even downright worthless. Teachers can say the same about some of their students. I hope in your time as a student that there have been enough good teachers to push you along and get you to become self-inspired and excited about your chosen field. Teaching is a tough arena with an awesome responsibility. Being a student also brings with it great responsibility. I don&rsquo;t know much about Corcoran but I hope all-in-all that you have gained something valuable in your time there. I would be curious to know what in particular frustrates you about your professors. It has been years since I taught but I still think I could learn something from today&rsquo;s design school issues.</p>

Society (at least the USA) has been bred to have ADD to somehow process more different forms of information in smaller bits. I&rsquo;m not normally a condoner of Noam Chomsky, but he has some good arguments about &ldquo;concision,&rdquo; and not only how it&rsquo;s dumbing us down, but actually making us less informed. I guess  that&rsquo;s a little more of a political issue and less typographic though. Sorry for the tangent.</div>

But I do feel like some design teachers see design school as a place where students should be doing crazy things that they could never get away with in commercial work, and some students are really interested in learning how to do things that would make for great commercial work.

<p><em>I think the smaller pages allowed for more places to stop, as well as for the reader to feel slightly more intelligent, that he could read a whole book so quickly.

<p>Chipman, I think the design is very much in service of the text here.  I re-read the Cheese Monkeys last night, and find that the stilted, alienated narrator&rsquo;s vignettes make the short sections the only logical choice.  As far as having lots of white-space, I find that it just makes the book much easier to read - none of my usual reading headaches.  :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What I&rsquo;m about to say has mostly been said already, but I&rsquo;d like explain the reasoning more thoroughly.</p>
<p><em>How to Read a Book</em> recommends essentially that books be read in multiple progressively longer and in-depth rounds. First, you read things like the introduction, conclusion and table of contents to get an idea of the <strong>structure</strong>. Second, you skim the book by reading only the important sentences. You do this to get a more detailed idea of <strong>structure</strong>, to get something of the book and to determine whether to read it in more depth. Third, if it&rsquo;s worth reading in more depth, you read it front to back, and forthly, you may go into extreme detail through things like outlining.</p>
<p>Paragraph breaks identify the important sentences; the first and last sentences ofa paragraph are generally more important than the middle sentences. <strong>Lack of necessary breaks and presence of unnecessary breaks both make skimming the book more difficult.</strong></p>
<p>Only a complete idiot would break paragraphs completely arbitrarily, so I hope there&rsquo;s some justification (hehe) for the breaks. If you find that some of the breaks are more important than others, it would certainly help to have a hierarchy of breaks.</p>
<p>Novels are sort of an exception because they are difficult to skim like that. Or maybe I just feel like that because I don&rsquo;t really like reading them. <em>How to Read a Book</em> still recommends steps equivalent to the steps for general reading, but I don&rsquo;t think it expects people to skim the book in the same way.</p>

<p>If you want a straight answer for this post, here it is: trust what you know, try different things, and keep at it until you think it looks and feels right for what you are designing. If you do not know if it looks or feels “right” ask the art director—or in your case the professor. They might have the experience and the know-how to help solve the problem.</p>

<p>That said, I think that whoever invented the barcode should be placed in a cell and forced to listen to the dial-up modem sound for the rest of his life.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I like Emigre&rsquo;s solution to the barcode on their later issues, placing it directly in the middle of the cover (i&rsquo;ve seen several other publications do this as well). It drew attention to what violator of form it is by making it part of the composition. I guess i&rsquo;m getting a bit off-topic, but I think it speaks the same for making lemonade when the copywriter/author hands you lemons.</div>

<p>Thomas: Well, that advice for &ldquo;how to read a book&rdquo; might make sense for certain types of nonfiction books, but certainly not for novels, and probably not for biographies or histories either.</p>
