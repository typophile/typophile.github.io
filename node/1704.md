body: 'Greetings, <BR> <BR>This is my first post here.  <BR>Please excuse my english.
  This is not my native language. <BR> <BR>I would just wish to know if anyone ever
  noticed a problem in FreeHand MX and 10 &#40;OS X&#41;... or is it me? <BR> <BR>In
  FreeHand MX and 10 &#40;OS X&#41;: <BR>Type an &#34;O&#34; and then use the menu
  &#34;Text : Convert to Paths&#34;. I see a whole bunch of segments. Way too much.
  <BR> <BR>Do the same in Illustrator 10 and below: <BR>No problems. <BR> <BR>Thank
  you for your input :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Yves Malouin'
