  body: "\r\nHey Mike, \r\n\r\nI kind of meant a typeface that was similar to ITC
    Coolman in keeping with the hand written look, but something that \r\nlooked slightly
    more elegant as i felt the 'c' and the 'h' in ITC Coolman looked a little childlike\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: I designed the Chocochic brand and all the packaging and the font I used was
    called Fabulous 50's. I can't remember if there are other variants within that
    same font or not. Maybe try Honey Script?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/honeyscript_4816.jpg]

  body: "Tamara, \"Fabulous50's\" appears to be a rip-off of ITC Coolman, without
    its kerning. That explains the awkward spacing of letters. That also explains
    why the Font Author was shown as 'unknown'. Please don't use fonts like that.
    When you can't find the name of the designer, you should be wary of a rip-off
    font.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, the \"Fabulous 50's\" font I have has the author name 'Pelle Piano'
    who says:\r\n\"This was my first real attempt to make a working font. It was found
    on an old record cover that I stumbled over on the Internet. It had only the letters
    \"The Fabulous 50s\". The rest was up to my imagination.Some worked out OK some
    are not that good, like \xC5.\xC4.\xD6 as you can see.\"\r\nso perhaps the font
    you've been looking at is an illegal one eh Mike??\r\n"
