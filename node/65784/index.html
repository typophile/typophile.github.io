  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>What are your thoughts about tracing or redrawing fonts? I know it&rsquo;s unethical, and maybe ilegal some times, but what about when you don&rsquo;t have the budget to buy a font family, but would like to use it on your projects? And by tracing, I mean doing the curves from zero, using the font as a guide, then using the vector shapes to &ldquo;set&rdquo; the type.</p>
<p>It happened to me when I worked on a little shop where the projects had a very little budget. We focused on poster design, and surprisingly, each poster design costed about what a regular font costs. We loved Helvetica, but obviously didn&rsquo;t have the money to buy it, so one time we thought about drawing all the characteres and setting each one of them manually in our projects. We didn&rsquo;t, and instead, focused on using free or really cheap fonts&hellip;</p>
<p>I started thinking about it again, and would like to hear the thoughts of typographers and type enthusiasts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In the sign industry, profit margins are very slim. There are times when we get art from clients, either printed or digital, without their <em>special</em> font. If the font does break my almost non existant software budget, and if I can use it on future projects, I&rsquo;ll buy it. Sometimes (rarely) if a client intends to use a font in a lot of signage I&rsquo;ll negotiate it into the price of the job. But, if the single weight or smallest package is cost prohibitive, I&rsquo;ll trace that sucker in a heartbeat. And, I&rsquo;m fast. By the time you figure the time it takes to find the font and the purchase price, they add up very quickly. If there are only a few letters, tracing is cheaper assuming that the sample is good enough. Competition in the sign industry is such that the difference of $30 bucks can cost you the job.</p>
<p>However, in the case suggested by firbrewd, I&rsquo;d just bite the bullet and buy the damn thing or use what is available. I hate copying other people&rsquo;s stuff.</p>

<p>This reality is one of the many reasons I positively loathe design contests and spec work! It&rsquo;s trickle down poverty; the designers can&rsquo;t afford to buy fonts, so the type designers sell fewer fonts.</p>

<p>???!</p>
<p>The question regarded ‘tracing a font for an identity project (commercial or personal)’. If the project were personal, I&rsquo;d be willing to let it go, but <em>any</em> commercial identity project should have a budget big enough to comfortably include a font license and there is no excuse for not paying for one. A typeface may contribute massively to an identity project and, if it forms the main constituent of the identity I&rsquo;d say that a standard per-user license fee would be incredibly cheap for the value gained from that typeface. [This is why Restraint is licensed under a different model for use in identity work: a recognition that typefaces have different value depending on their use.]</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting points of view, everyone.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how well known it is, but in developing countries, identity design, for example, isn&rsquo;t considered as something that should be paid considerably, with a budget that could include the purchase of a whole type family — just design as usual, with low pay as usual. I&rsquo;ve had this debate many times, if tracing some letterforms to make a logo would be ethical or not, because in the first place, you aren&rsquo;t copying the &lsquo;font&rsquo; itself, and second, you&rsquo;d be tracing a few letters (let&rsquo;s say the logotype is Pepsi). Would it be fair to pay full price for five letterforms?</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m not degrading the work of the typographer at all, and in fact, I think it&rsquo;s one of the most important pieces of a design project, but sometimes, the price of a font should be considered. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fair to pay less for a font on a project of a five letters logo, than on one involving heavy use of the font, as in a magazine? It should be also considered that you could manually set the type of the logo (thus ignoring the &lsquo;font&rsquo; or programming aspect of the type), just using the vectors, but in a magazine, you need advanced options that a good font will provide, like kerning pairs, ligatures, extended latin characters, and so on.</p>
<p>Also, we could make some exceptions here. Sometimes a font is so heavily used (like Helvetica or Arial) that &ldquo;it feels light air — it&rsquo;s just there&rdquo;, that one wonders if it could apply for a more open licence of some sort, or use a way lower price than regular fonts. Could be used for another debate.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This discussion touches on something that has been bothering me for a while now. My case is different from the scenario described above, as there was no font file produced at all – I simply drew and &ldquo;kerned&rdquo; the glyphs required to build four words using images of an existing font as a starting point.</p>
<p>While looking at some sketches for a masthead for [[http://www.danpetter.net/|my website]], I registered a substancial inspiration by an existing font, the wonderful [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/ars_type/ars_maquette_black/|Maquette Black]]. Even so, I didn&rsquo;t want to plainly set it in Maquette for a number of reasons: some of its proportions and glyph shapes were not right for my purposes, and felt I had to add/exaggerate some contrast here and there; also, a license would set me back almost €200, as Maquette is available as a 5-font-package only. Still, I figured I could save some time <em>and</em> produce a much better result if I used Maquette Black as a starting point. So I set the four words online, traced the resulting screenshots and developed my own design from there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dealt with an amorphous feeling of remorse ever since, blaming myself for harvesting the fruit of another designers legwork. The tenor of this thread offers some relief from those worries.</p>

<p>Almost any, I agree. But there are exceptions.</p>
<p>Let me be clear though - to me it&rsquo;s not OK if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it results in a font in any hands besides the designer&rsquo;s.</li>
<li>the font could be afforded, the person just wants to save a few bucks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the second point is a thorny gray area, but so is life!</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be fair to pay less for a font on a project of a five letters

<p>Some people did exactly that during the phototype age, and first URW and then Letterror tried it for digital fonts a while ago (but I guess it didn&rsquo;t really fly).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Typefaces represent added value in a design project. If they didn&rsquo;t, then one could just use Courier for everything. Designers select particular typefaces because they add value to the overall design in some way. So, it makes sense to consider the value and hence the appropriate cost of a typeface in terms of the added value, rather than in terms of either number of users of a font or quantity of text set in the font. This is why it makes no sense to me to suggest that using a typeface in a logotype that uses only five letters should cost less than using the same typeface to set the text of a magazine, because it is entirely likely that the added value in the logotype project is much higher than in the magazine.</p>
<p>Hrant, I think your two criteria under which tracing is unacceptable miss what seems to me the real problem: that someone other than the designer or licensed vendor/user of those letters is <em>profiting</em> &ndash; either directly or in added value &ndash; from the use of those letters. Simply put, it is exploitation of another&rsquo;s work and creativity to create wealth or value without compensating that person. I put it in the same category as failing to pay wages for work done.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of developing countries, why ape the design of the industrialised nations by copying fonts? Why not encourage domestic creativity and the work of local lettering artists, sign painters, etc., which may in turn develop into a domestic type design business.</p>

<p>Its&rsquo;s easier said than done. Clients are the ones demanding certain typefaces, not designers themselves. However, I see your point, and it&rsquo;s a valid one.</p>
<p>Hrant: That&rsquo;s exactly what I was trying to explain, well put. I think it&rsquo;d be pretty hard to let one&rsquo;s sister die instead of just taking some food from a supermarket, and it&rsquo;s clear why.</p>

<p>Sure, relative. But there&rsquo;s a threshold price for tools, a start up cost that is recouped across subsequent projects. Like a carpenter buying tools. They might be seen as expensive to begin with, but the cost is recouped as they are used. It&rsquo;s the same with graphic design. It&rsquo;s the same with any similar business. A photographer buys a camera, so on, so forth.</p>
