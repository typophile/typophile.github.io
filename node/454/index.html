<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody><a href=http://www.quark.com/products/xpress/ target=_blank>Quark</a> finally announced their long needed <br>upgrade to XPress 6.0. <br> <br>Have you switched to <a href=http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/ target=_blank>InDesign</a>? <br> <br>Are you finally moving ahead with Quark?</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I haven't even upgraded to QXP5... I work with InDesign Full-Time now, whenever a client forces me to use QXP, my price goes up because it just takes THAT much longer to get things done right. ID has very few flaws left while Quark more and more feels caught between the weight of old age and the massive lack of innovative ideas. Integration, reliability, creativity, speed... ID is my first choice in Layut and even in smaller stuff I once did in Freehand. What Photoshop has become in terms of Imageediting, ID has become in terms of designing pages...</div>

<div class=commentbody>what is with those tiny little screen shots on the XP 6 <br>"first look" page!? are they trying to hide something? <br>they certainly aren't providing much in the way of <br>meaningful product info. <br> <br>regardless, Quark has made it clear that they are <br>disinterested with customer support, designers, the <br>Mac, and Unicode. while I admire their unabashed <br>arrogance, I have completely written them off for future <br>upgrades. unfortunately, I'm still working with OS 9 and <br>QXP 4 while I await a full switch to X. <br> <br>by the end of the year, I will be running OS X and the <br>full Adobe arsenal (PS, AI, ID, and Acrobat) in their most <br>recent incarnations. I have always found Adobe to be a <br>reliable and design-focused company. it is encouraging <br>to know that they have been extraordinarily successful <br>as such. <br> <br>the design community has a fantastic assest in <br>InDesign.

<div class=commentbody>Man, I hope more people switch to ID. Although OpenType isn't the most democratic format right now, the upsides of the format are just dandy with me, text-setting hasn't been as much fun in years. <br>And as Adobe and URW and Lino and some other companies are making the switch to OTF and others, like House and Emigre sloooowly trying their hands at the extended possibilities of that format as well, I think Quark will either include OTF or involuntary give Adobe a marketing bonus. <br> <br>Quark only survives because people are so used to it. I have worked with both systems and as of ID 1.5 Adobe has far surpassed Quark in my opinion. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Keith, I use InDesign and Acrobat Distiller -- it's a perfect combination Exported PDF works okay (better than any otheer direct-to-PDF-export, the EPS-Export is also nice), but Distiller still is the safest and most flexible way to do it. Since I work with InDesign and on Win-based workstations, I have preferred PDF for well over five years now, when most printersor film-outputters didn't even accept them. Thanks to Computer-to-plate that has changed. PDF is the best way to get your data to the outputter and InDesign+Distiller is a Killer combination. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Many type people seem to love InDesign. Fantastic. <br>But we're talking about a work flow issue here. Quark <br>is central to the fabric of publishing almost everywhere <br>so switching (especially now with native X Quark) is a <br>big deal. Most people won't bother.

<div class=commentbody>I've only been using InDesign 2.0 since last August. I really love it for all the OpenType features. I've only been using it for small and simple 1-2 page jobs though, so I don't know how well it works for more complex colour stuff.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Did someone suggest that Quark 6 doesn't support OpenType? <br>Will they in the future? <br> <br>_________ <br>Related Tangent: <br> <br>It's very interesting to track Adobe versus Quark and <br>Macromedia. <br> <br>It seems pretty clear from Macromedia's moves in the last <br>year (buying Cold Fusion, launching MX, pushing Flash to a <br>much richer, application development tool) that they're <br>much more interested in creating apps for the development <br>of enterprise-level web sites. It's a smart move for <br>Macromedia, but it's just interesting to see it happen. I <br>wonder if Freehand will eventually go the way of XRes and <br>Fontographer. <br> <br>Then there's Quark. They have a huge foothold in the <br>publishing industry (not just graphic design). They've taken <br>XML and run with it. Maybe ID can do that too - I'm not <br>sure - but I can't see these old, giant companies switching <br>to ID as easily as an agency or a design firm or even a <br>school could.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have heard that the pretty big Publicis company in France Switched to Indesign. <br> <br>As John Hudson pointed out ,couple of months ago, Quark guys came a day to Unicode conference to say they will never support this silly Unicode stuff. How stupid how they are! I really don't know how they will manage xml in the future without Unicode. <br> <br>At my own little user experience, I have used xml import for dictionnary layout in Indesign, it worked correctly (not perfect, but more because the xml wasn't set up correctly and because I lack of experience), mainly a set up of Style sheet, et voil</div>

<div class=commentbody>I finally downloaded a trial copy of inDesign a couple of months back and I've never opened quark since. Aside from being vastly more intuitive than quark, the type setting and style sheet features are top notch. Also, no more bitmapped fonts. Precise letterspacing and kerning were impossible on screen in Quark because of the terrible display of most T1 fonts. ID does a much better job. Finally, the collect for output features of ID are a thousand times better than Quark, though perhaps a topic of disagreement among type designers. ID actually collects your fonts upon your request. (You do get a dialog box warning you that you may be in violation of copyright by doing so) And if you don't want to send your fonts, you can convert them to outlines. Another ID only feature. <br> <br>Needless to say, I'm sold. I hate to see the market dominated by a goliath such as adobe, but as long as quark keeps developing such an inferior product, adobe it shall be.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The set of common InDesign concerns/myths are: <br> <br><i>"No one uses InDesign."</i> <br>Every designer I've introduced to InDesign has switched to <br>it for the majority of their work. Quark definitely still has <br>the lionshare of the market but they've been the only game in <br>town for years. The broad adoption of InD has be relatively speedy. <br> <br><i>"Quark is the proven standard. How can I be sure InD can do <br>everything that Quark can?"</i> <br>I've designed and output a 72-page full-color catalog with InD. <br>Not only can it do everything Quark can do, but I have <br>no doubt InD's superior UI and features saved me days on <br>the production of this piece. But don't take my lousy word <br>for it, take it from <a href=http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/customerstories.html target=_blank>these folks</a>. (Fossil and Glamour UK are <br>not small fry.) <br> <br><i>"No one will output InDesign files."</i> <br>Bullpoop! I live in a pretty small market (Salt Lake City) <br>and we haven't come across one service bureau or <br>press that would refuse an InDesign document. Sure, some <br>will grimace and gripe a bit, but it's getting smoother now <br>that more and more local designers are moving to InD. <br>Moreover, almost everyone takes PDFs these days, and InD's <br>PDF export is far cleaner and quicker than Quark's.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I will cast a blind eye to any Quark development in the future. Quark let me down over 5 or 6 years ago and I've been forced to use them because of their stranglehold on the industry, but Adobe InDesign has given me a taste of freedom, and have given page layout the overhaul that Quark has needed since the late 90's. <br> <br>I'm still learning the finer points of InDesign, but nothing will distract me from it. Adobe has proven its commitment to the design community over and over for years. Plus, Adobe most of the other application I use in my print work. Why switch to another system, another GUI, another product, to hold it all together?</div>

<div class=commentbody>The downside of the file restauration management of ID (which, at least partially was already one of the nicer features of Pagemaker) is that whenever I work in Quark or Freehand I forget that THEY DO NOT HAVE something along those lines. So you experiment more, save less often inbetween, and when it crashes, it's gone for good. No prob with ID, but on Freehand you have no chance of retrieving your designs. FH, even in the MX version, sucks compared to Indesign. <br>Photoshop could use somthing like this as well, especially as they DO save intermediary files on your harddisk, so restoring them after a crash should be rrrrrelatively simple to program. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I've been a staunch supporter of Quark for <br>years.

There are so many more options in ID. <br>I will never go back and work is like <br>going back in time. <br> <br>Quark, I guess it was just one of those <br> things... one of those crazy flings... <br> <br>I'll never go to 6.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>> You can do everything in Indesign.</i> <br> <br>While I am a fierce advocate of InDesign and use <br>it since the infamous version 1.0, I must disagree <br>on one point: it cannot do <i>everything</i> Quark does. <br> <br>At my job, we often design low budget stuff in two <br>Pantone spot colors.

I actually <br>had a hilarious time reading a magazine review where <br>the author went as far as extolling the "Straight Line <br>Tool" which draws only horizontal or vertical lines <br>(as opposed to holding down the friggin' 'shift' key) <br>as an advantage of Quark. It all sounded a bit sad. <br> <br>This being said, I do all my page lay-outs in Indesign, <br>from simple one-page things to multi-chaptered indexed <br>catalogues with tables of contents and all the trimmings. <br>No way am I going to support this overpriced dinosaur <br>of a program.</div>

You should send this into Adobe as a wishlist item. This is a really good feature. Hmmm. 1000 pts InDesign v. 1 pt. Quark. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>Yeah, that is one big minus. Although I mostly found workarounds with mixing Cyan and Magenta or something and using those channels for the seperations, it would be nice to have fully mixable Pantone spot colours with accurate screen preview. <br> <br>I also wish that they would include some option to change the size of indivudal spaces, at least the pagewidth -- that would be good for fold-up-pages and Leporellos. ALso, it would be nice to have an option that makes the table borders and cells visible even if you do not have an outline (and the handling of adding outlines to the cells could be a bit easier, imo). <br> <br>The shift key thing I'm used to from FH, so that never bothered me at all. I also took the time to synchronize my keyboard shortcuts in FH/Shop/ID, which makes life THAT much easier afterwards. <br>:-D. </div>

<div class=commentbody><i>> The downside of the file restauration management of ID <br>(...) is that whenever I work in Quark (...)

I can't lose <br>more than 15 minutes of work when my computer crashes. <br> <br>This sounds <i>SO</i> silly, me 'defending' Quark's (very few) <br>virtues while at work I'm the one nagging everybody about <br>switching to InDesign for good. I hope my boss never stumbles <br>upon this thread. ;)</div>
