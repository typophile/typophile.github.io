body: "I have used TypeTool3 to make minor adjustments to our font that we use internally.
  \ I now need to make changes that are far easier to accomplish if FOG5.\r\n\r\nThe
  problem is that if I take my vfb file and generate a true type font using TT3, the
  characters come out smooth and well formed.  \r\n\r\nIf I take the same vfb file
  in FOG5 and generate a true type font, the characters are more jagged and the down
  strokes on the lower case q, d and u are very thin.  \r\n\r\nThe only thing I did
  before generating in FOG5 is selecting all the glyphs and enabling auto hinting
  for them (since in TT3, I had the option checked to auto hint any unhinted fonts).\r\n\r\nAm
  I missing a setting that is automatically set in TT3?"
