  any magazine, or newspaper, which uses helvetica as it's main font (for articles,
  etc.)? Would be kickass, if someone could help! Thank you in advance.

    beautifully set in Helvetica. Also, most of architecture magazines which I come
    across appear to be set mainly in Helvetica. Bloomberg Businessweek is another
    magazine using Helvetica. '
