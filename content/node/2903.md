  the site mentioned in bj harvey&#39;s Letraset Tattoo thread. <BR> <BR>I wonder
  whether  typophiles should offer some more refined letter forms. His database is
  quite weak in some characters.  <BR> <BR>It also remimded me of this site, which
  is pretty cool too <a href="http://www.lares.dti.ne.jp/%7Eyugo/storage/monocrafts_ver3/03/index.html"

  <BR> <BR>I did try searching the boards for these, but even if they&#39;re not new
  I&#39;m sure they deserve a reprise. <BR> <BR>BTW: I&#39;ve got loads off the stuff
  &#40;Letraset, in the UK&#41; if anybody is interested, but my marker pens dried
  up years ago <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif" ALT=":-&#40;"
