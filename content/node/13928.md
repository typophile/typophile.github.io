    Foundry</a> )</em> seems to have served as the 'Inspiration' for 'Blender'.. <em>Hmm..</em>

    the layout designers grumbled througout the entire process. Maybe Gridnik works
    better.  \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    this blender face, but it looks like it is being sold for around EUR 200. i dont
    know what that is in US$ but i am sure it is more than 200.\r\nouch. i am just
    a poor type student."

  body: Another alternative to look at is "Mandrax" by Feliciano (myfonts.com), although
    Blender is much more subtle. Die Gestalten has another face on their website called
    "Regular" which is a little less expensive, but similar to Blender. Gridnik seems
    to work surprisingly well for a text face. Phaidon has a series of pocket-sized
    photography books called "55" which uses Gridnik (I'm pretty sure it's Gridnik
    anyway). Really nice little books.

  body: "I think blender has it's own integrity. I don't know how it would fare in
    a long text setting but a good deal better than most of the altrenates offered
    here I bet - gridnik aside. \r\n\r\nI wonder if you could get it from Phil's fonts
    or Font font or Myfonts.com ...\r\n\r\nWhat did you do in the end?"
