body: "I need to use an company name in running text and am having wondering about
  the placement of the reserved symbol. It sucks I can't write the name of the company
  because it's changing and hasn't launched. Boo. I'm trying to make this understandable
  without giving away the name. Let's say there are two sentences here in each example:\r\n\r\nLorm
  ipsu dolor New Name, Inc.(R) New Name Subsidiary cetti mar klepto pacis.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nLorem
  ipsum dolor New Name, Inc(R). New Name Subsidiary cetti mar kelpto pacis.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
  the problem is the first two words of the first company name (incorporated) begin
  with the same letter. Then on the second company name (a subsidiary), the first
  two words are the same. It starts to look confusing in the first example.\r\n\r\nGrammatically
  I would think the first option was correct, because Inc. needs the period. But then
  the (R) looks to be sitting outside that sentence and belong to the next sentence.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?"

    I searched and searched every major company out there... Apple, Inc. Adobe Systems
    Incorporated, Nike, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Yahoo, Inc., Microsoft, Inc. etc.
    and couldn't find one instance where they showed a registered trademark with the
    company name.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has quite a list.\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/library/toolbar/3.0/trademarks/en-us.mspx\r\n\r\nI
