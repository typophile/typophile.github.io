  that should be merged into a single suitcase.\r\nIt becomes very tedious to scroll
  through huge blocks of the same typeface that should be nested into the same suitcase.\r\nIs
  there a way to group these families into a single suitcase through the use of a
  freeware application or other means?\r\nI am using 10.5.\r\n\r\nI have attached
  an image for reference.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "There's no such thing as a \"suitcase\" with PC TrueType fonts. The fonts
    are probably not named well so they are not grouped in application font menus.\r\n\r\nYou
    should contact the foundry for a fix."

  body: In the case of Aaux (the font family in your example image), the foundry has
    chosen to put each font style into its own family of one. This is not an uncommon
    practice and is done mainly to avoid cross-platform document compatibility problems
    due to differences in the way font families are handled on Macs and PCs. There
    isn't any simple way to change the way a font's names are set up. It's one of
    the more complicated areas of font development. If you know what you are doing,
    you could do it with TTX, but I wouldn't recommend it. I would agree with Jens--it
    would be best to contact the foundry.
