body: 'I finally figured out that to build a nice quirky sans face, the first thing  you
  have to do is figure out the curves in the letters &#39;b, c, d. g, j, o, p, q,
  r, and s&#39; Once you get those curves down, then you are in business. I wish somebody
  would have told me this months ago. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":&#41;"> <BR>Back to the post about &#39;how do you build a face,&#39; I would
  suggest making a lot of elliptical and rounded square shapes &#40;unite/pathfinder
  a semi-circle on the end of a square&#41;. Then empty the fill and work off the
  stroke, but don&#39;t create outlines....always keep the outlines so the weight
  can stay consistent. When the face is finished, make sure your weights are consistent
  before you join and outline, or outline and unite. <BR>Always save a copy of the
  beziers off to the side for tweaking. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s apollo sans. Any feedback
  is welcome. <BR> <BR>bj <BR><!-Attachment: apollo.swf-!><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1><TR><TD><IMG

  body: ' You have some interesting strokes and structures, but I think the font could
    benefit from some smoothing and balancing of the curves, particularly on the &#34;B&#34;,
    &#34;J&#34;, &#34;R&#34; &#40;short-tailed version, especially -- maybe try cutting
    the tail&#39;s terminal obliquely?&#41;, &#34;S&#34;, &#34;3&#34;, &#34;5&#34;,
    and, to a lesser extent, on the &#34;2&#34; and the tail of the &#34;Q&#34; &#40;same
    suggestion as the &#34;R&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>The font as a whole seems as though
    it wants to be a geometric sans, but isn&#39;t quite making it. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    also not sure you need the slight vestigal serifs on the tops of &#34;C&#34; and
    &#34;G&#34;. <BR> <BR>The upper arm of the &#34;K&#34; could be pulled back in
    a bit, too, to keep it from looking top-heavy. <BR> <BR>The vertices of the &#34;N&#34;
    are bothering me a bit as well. In fact, I think it might work better with the
    rest of the font if it were simply inverted, placing the sharper vertex at the
    bottom right and the blunter vertex at the upper left. <BR> <BR>Final suggestion:
    tone down the horizontals of the brackets a bit, to keep them from looking heavier
    than the rest of the font. <BR> <BR>As far as the structures go, I really like
    the direction you&#39;re exploring. I&#39;ve always thought that a geometric face
    should at least be playful with the geometry, or why bother with it at all? <BR>
    <BR>The &#34;G&#34; with a descending tail and double-V &#34;W&#34; are favorites
    of mine, and I also very much like your construction of the &#34;8&#34;. '

  body: ' David - Thanks for the comments. <BR> <BR>&#42; some of the widths are off,
    evident when I type in certain words. <BR> <BR>&#42; Definitely, the curves need
    some work. I noticed that when I dropped it into Fontographer, I chose clean up
    points, insert points at extrema and it messed up some curves. For example, zoom
    in on the &#39;O&#39; and look at the counter. It used to be perfect, now it&#39;s
    nasty. I am now deleting stray points with the minus &#40;pen&#41; tool, though
    it takes longer. Anybody know a shortcut to remove strays but keep the basics
    intact? <BR> <BR> - I like your suggestion on the &#39;R&#39; <BR> <BR>&#42; I&#39;ll
    pull that K arm in. <BR> <BR>&#42; Can you point me to any geometric sans in particular?
    <BR> <BR>&#42; I&#39;ll see how the &#39;N&#39; looks flipped. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    the brackets were just bracketed on, not intended to match the face. Kind of like
    the movies where the words don&#39;t match the lips. <BR> <BR>Thanks David. <BR>
    <BR>Great to see you back. '

  body: ' For getting rid of points, probably the best way is the &#34;Merge Points&#34;
    command &#40;Cmd-M, under the &#34;Points&#34; menu&#41;. But make a copy of the
    original form in the Template layer beforehand, so that you can adjust the new
    form to something closer to the original &#40;Fog doesn&#39;t do the best job
    with Merge&#41;. <BR> <BR>Another way is by using &#34;Simplify Curves&#34;, but
    that&#39;s much harder to control. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: Ah.... Your explanation of the curves issue answered my point about being
    a geometric sans. Solve the curves, and you&#39;ll solve the perceived identity
    crisis. :&#93; <BR> <BR>But check out Frantisek Storm&#39;s &#34;Bahnhof&#34;
    anyway. ;&#93;  <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/FontFamily9528.html"
