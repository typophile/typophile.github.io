  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I was going to browse the wiki looking for foundries that might be interested in distributing some of my work. <strong>since the wiki is <em>down</em> *suggestion: get the wiki back, please?*</strong> I figured I'd ask a relevant question of the community.
<ol>
<li>What is the minimum degree of completeness for a single font required by most foundries? What is the preferred level of completeness? (aside: hrant, I know nothing is ever finished in type design :-) )</li>
<li>Are any foundries known to be kind to beginners? By this I mean, if they reject a submission to the offer criticism?</li>
<li>How hard is it, really?</li>
<li>What advice would you give to someone who wants to see their design reach a wide audience and maybe make a few dollars in the process?</li>
<li>Whatever I haven't thought to ask explicitly but which would nonetheless be relevant to the overall question of "how do I transition from an interest in type design to being a type designer?"</li>
</ol></div>

		<div class="commentbody">in (partial) answer to your questions:

1) most foundries want font submissions to be pretty much the final version. if an extensive amount of work is still in order, some foundries may finish the font for you, but with a cut in the royalties you would receive.
2) my only real expereince is with [[IHOF]]. I'm selling my first face, Kilkenny, through them. I think if a foundry thinks a design has potential, but needs a bit of tweaking, they'll give you suggestions on things you could change. i believe (i could be wrong) that you could set up your own foundry with myfonts.com. check this info: http://www.myfonts.com/info/prospectus/
3) i had an in with IHOF since i work for P22, but had they not wanted to market this design, i would have tried letterheadfonts.com, as i feel my Victorian face was a good fit with much of their stuff and I think they would have gone for it. I think the trick is just to find a good fit for your work.
4) hmmm... i'm still waiting to see how i do on this one. my first face is an experiment of sorts... i think the best way to make $$$ is to make a name for yourself and have your own website where users can order/download your fonts. i think fontdiner.com is an excellent model of this. this method involves more hassle: you have to do your own marketing and get your name out there. you also have to set up your website, &c... but the upside is you get to keep all the profits.
5) i'll leave more qualified persons to answer this one.

also: don't forget about the <a href="http://typophile.com/forum/7">Release</a> section of the forums. there are several threads that answer similar questions, including this one:
