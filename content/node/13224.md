  body: "Dot accent is a quite common diacritical mark in some European languages.
    It is used in Maltese (over 'c', 'g', 'z'), Lithuanian (over 'e'), Polish (over
    'z') and Turkish (they distinct between  i/\u0130 \u2014 \u0131/I \u2014 i with
    and without dot). And actually, the dot as a diacritical mark can be found in
    every language using Latin script over 'i'.\r\nMore at <a href=\"http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=15\">Project

  body: "Spooky, just last week I was thinking that in German one could get away with
    making the umlaut one dot... It would be especially helpful in caps. If you did
    this at the type design level, the font would not be [easily] usable for a language
    that uses <strong>both</strong> single and double dots [on the same vowels]. Are
    there any such languages Filip? While if you did this at the composition level,
    you'd have to worry about circumventing spell-checking issues.\r\n\r\nOr what
    about using a macron-style umlaut?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Catalan (u/c & l/c I and U for diaeresis and u/c & l/c L for dot) and Turkish
    (u/c & l/c O and U for diaeresis and u/c I for dot) use both but not on the same
    character and Hungarian uses the diaeresis (umlaut) and double acute (Hungarian
    umlaut). Macron seems to be Lithuanian and Latvian also used for transliteration
    of Arabic.\r\nTim"
