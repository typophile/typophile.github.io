		<div class="commentbody">By the way, here is how a headstone is done in our cemeteries:
After the burial of the deceased, the grave is sealed with a stone placed horizontally (not vertically) then the electric stone-cutter is driven from LTR inscribing the RTL wh+how info in fascinating Calligraphy, without prior outlining. More surprisingly, the inscription takes place only after fixing the stone leaving no room for errors. Incredible!</div>

Dan, I make fun of mediocrity anywhere. But being dyslexic for example does not necessarily qualify. To qualify you need to not care. You certainly don't need to be rich to care. Heck, you don't even need arms to care:

A rotting piece of wood has much more dignity than that mess immortalized.

What kind of literacy are we talking about? I'm talking about the literacy of caring. We, collectively here, have a problem with people who think font selection is unimportant. Same difference in this case. Just like when you design a good font or logo but then see a case of mediocre design (including by large corporations), put yourself in the position of the stonecutter who was not hired to do it right.

We have no idea of the context in which it was made. Either someone without ability (and possibly of low intellect) did the best they could in what was probably difficult circumstances, or maybe Hrant is right and whoever engraved it didn't care, which suggests an even sadder story.

Either way, I think it's equally unworthy of designer criticism.

If you think this memorial lacks dignity, just beacause it is relatively cheap and not expertly engraved, then that is your failing.

		<div class="commentbody">Using the money for the stone to pay a woodcarver instead would have been much better. If you can't do it well, know that, and at least don't immortalize your deficiency. Have the humility to fade into the [back]ground with dignity. This way many generations will look at that headstone and feel -even more- sorry for Shula.

Maybe the father was arrogant, or dirt cheap, or had a family feud with the town stonecutter? As Jon hints, we can't know enough to be sure - but of course that can't and shouldn't prevent people from thinking and opining.

		<div class="commentbody">Wait, that doesn't look like stone, it looks like cement! Maybe the father was a cement guy? So I'm guessing they poored the cement into the typical wood frame on the ground, then figured to just use a branch or something while it was still wet. I'm certainly a fan of heartfelt spontaneity, but: Had they never seen a headstone before? And when they were finished, didn't they realize it was too cruddy? They could have made a second, better one - or even just resurfaced it with a bit more cement and tried again. I think it's pretty safe to say they didn't care.

		<div class="commentbody">To a naive person, crafsmanship may have a different meaning. People of little means have always felt the only option was to use their own hands--that the sweat and toil of their own hands had more to say than the perfection of craft by someone else's. I think of it as well like the crude, hard to read, crayoned, get well wishes from my kids several years ago when I was getting heart bypass surgurey. Their own hands may have been poor at the lettering craft, but the meaning was far more powerful than any of Zapf's finest work.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks to Hrant for giving us something to think about and talk about. 

Wormwood said,
"We have no idea of the context in which it was made."

Yes we do know some context. Just based on the picture Hrant posted we know it marks a grave from 1905. I extrapolated more context from the link that contained the picture. It is a grave at the Wassamssaw Baptist Church in Berkeley County, South Carolina. The closest stonecutters at that time were a hundred miles away in Charleston — cars, expressways and freight forwarding weren't around at that time BTW. The stone is more than likely limestone, the cheapest stone available and it's very soft. There is plenty more context that I gathered.

I think Miss Tiffany and dezcom get it right. When my time comes I couldn't care less. Gravemarkers are for the living, not the dead. But my living thoughts are that I would prefer mine be made by someone without skills that cares rather than a hired hand. The key that Shula's marker was made by someone that cared is the poem.

Hrant, just saying that they could've sold some deer carcasses to cover the expense is being flippant. I am, nevertheless, glad you're giving your honest thoughts.</div>

I should have said 'We have no idea of the <em><strong>human</em></strong> context in which it was made.'

Like BlueStreak, I've now managed to extrapolate a lot more from the picture...

Shula's parents had already died from the same plague that finished her off. Only her 8 year old twin brothers remained, who were now homeless as the family shack had been reposessed by a merciless landlord. Winter came early in 1905 and it was amidst a bitter snow storm on the edge of the cemetary that the two crippled and pox ridden boys, Walta and Hecta, struggled to fulfill their dead mother's wishes by creating a lasting memorial to her beloved daughter. If they lifted even a stick from the ground the sheriff would shoot them for stealing firewood, so Walta made do and used the rotten stumps of Hecta's diseased fingers to scratch the words into the freezing cement. Or maybe not.

Craftsmanship can say a lot, but mainly only about the craftsman. Hrant's probably right. If it walks like sh¡te and talks like sh¡te then...

Gosh, I guess I'm just silly, because I feel the total opposite :(
I really couldn't care what my memorial says. And if I ever commission any, their text with be sparse. No need to spill so many words, I think. The most important element of a marker, in my opinion, is the dash! You, know "1925–1993." The year of birth and death really don't mean all that much compared with the dash… the dash is someone's entire life, boiled down into just one little mark!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@hrant:
<cite>Thinking about this thread, I have a feeling that the resistance to what I'm saying might be in large part a knee-jerk reaction based on the "death complex": the fear of our own death causes us to avoid -and even combat- any criticism of expressions of mourning. In this respect I think much can be learned from Mexican and Hindu cultures.</cite>

Although I do have to admit that the engraving on the tombstone in question is not well done, I'm afraid I do have to go with the naysayers on this one.

The proper attitude to take, when there is mourning, is to mourn with those who mourn. To empathize with their suffering. Compassion, not squeamishness or fear of death, is what I think is the motivator.</div>
