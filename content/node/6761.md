body: Wondering if anyone knows what the dotted typeface is. I&#39;ve looked at myfonts.com,
  fontshop, veer and a few other places and can&#39;t find a match. The design firm
  is in the UK, so maybe it&#39;s available only in Europe? Thanks for any help...<img

  body: it&#39;s not a match, but Kirmes <BR>is an E&#43;F dotfont with a little <BR>bit
    more personality. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.elsner-flake.com/" target="_blank">http://www.elsner-flake.com/</a>
    <BR> <BR>If it suits you, you could make a font like this in <BR>about half an
    hour.  <BR>In a vector app, just make a 5X7 dot grid, <BR>duplicate it 36 times,
    and remove dots <BR>to make letters and numbers. <BR> <BR>bj

  body: Thanks for the ideas. So many of these are close but not exact, maybe it is
    a custom face. BJ, thanks for the idea, I might just give that a try...

  body: Ignacio, this seems to be the closest match. This really is good work - especially
    for one of these shareware/freeware fonts. I try to stay away from these since
    so often they aren&#39;t worth the download.
