body: I&#39;ve got some of the usual script faces &#40;like Bellevue, Dorchester,
  Flemish, Kuenstler, Shelley, Sloop, etc.&#41; but I&#39;m looking for something
  really special like the script font -- and especially the flourishy border -- in
  the attached sample. Any ideas where I should begin my search? Thanks for any direction
  you can give. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/11879.jpg"

  body: Sloop, from Font Bureau, as some beautiful alternates. But maybe it isn&#39;t
    copperplate enough?

  body: Stephen, did you mean to attach that link? I was excited to see Anglia Script
    and instead read about americanskas.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Adobe Bickham Script has a lot of scroll-like flourishes. Available in OpenType
    format as well as in Multiple Master format &#40;from Veer&#41;. Bowfin.com has
    a very good identification file for scripts.

  body: Thank you all! After doing a lot of business-to-business design, I&#39;m looking
    forward to working on something with a little more historical reference --- an
    old theatre here in Memphis. And isn&#39;t that playbill from 1943 beautiful!
    Thanks again. I&#39;m off on a typeface treasure hunt!

    target="_blank">http://www.ultimatesymbol.com/products/category.php</a> <BR> <BR>Use
    the pop-up to select  Spencerian / Flourishes / Accents.  Not as nice as your
    sample, but a good place to start for the ornate flourished border. Think the
    individual art is about $10 US a pop, cheaper to buy the CD ROM if you can use
    other parts for another project. <BR>'
