  body: "Do they use the same font for any other lettering? I might have a better
    chance with a couple more letters that are helpful for ID purposes. The 'a' is
    the only sort of distinctive letter in this logo. If you do have more letters,
    you could try the new version of the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php|Sans
    Guide]] that lets you pick the shapes of key letters, and then it shows which
    fonts have those shapes. Having the 'a' wasn't enough for me to spot this one,
    although I tried.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hey Mike,\r\n\r\nI don't see this typeface used anywhere else on the website.
    I'll give Sans Guide a shot, something close to this typeface should suffice for
    the project i'm working on. I appreciate the help =)"
