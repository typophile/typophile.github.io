		<div class="commentbody">Tell me about it. The CEO is having difficulty letting go of products and services that he knows the company is capable of providing. Myself, and many others from what I&#39;ve heard, have encouraged him to focus on one or two of their primary services &#40;preferrably ones that offer the highest ROI&#41; and dedicate all resources to them. Due to his stubborness to let go, I am taking a compromised approach by catagorizing his various products and services into comprehensive divisions. In the future eKnowledge will be marketed as: &#40;1&#41; eKnowledge - systems &#43; information management, &#40;2&#41; eKnowledge - training &#43; education, &#40;3&#41; eKnowledge - rich media marketing &#43; PR, or some similar catagorical divisions. At least that way, their will be added clarity to the customers. I&#39;m working on the proposal now, so hopefully, he&#39;ll buy into it. <BR> <BR>Oh yah, back to the critique. I am favoring the altered Georgia logotype also. I didn&#39;t want to say anything until I had heard from someone. Considering the broad customer base, I think it is the most universal of the options. The reason I included the Futana type was because I think it lends well to using a byline &#40;reason for including all that gibberish above&#41;, which will be a necessity if I am successful in my pitch. <BR> <BR>Thank you for the critique.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I definitely agree that the Georgia version is the best choice.  It&#39;s strong, but not cold. It&#39;s also got a nice unique flavor. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s something about it that makes my eyes/brain try to see Greek or Cyrillic characters in the word &#40;I speak/ write neither, by the way&#41;. I don&#39;t know if this matters, or is something others see, but I can&#39;t seem to shake it from my head. I think it has to do with the terminals, the curve-terminal combinations that the italic makes and the custom ligatures. Again, this is really here nor there. <BR> <BR>I also agree with Cristian and Tim about the eK ligature needing tweaking to make it lighter, and Tim about the g&#39;s descender and trying a ge ligature. It didn&#39;t bother me, but once I caught the connections running through the whole word, the end e seemed left out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of those three I like the Georgia the most, but I think it&#39;s still off-track. I think you need something squat, geometric and somewhat bland.

Available through <a href="http://www.fontshop.de" target="_blank">http://www.fontshop.de</a> , but not cheap. <BR> <BR>BTW, is there a way you can make the logo modular?

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all for the great feedback. I apologize for not responding with anything of interest yet, but I wanted to acknowledge the helpful critique I&#39;ve received and provide a brief update. <BR> <BR>Last Tuesday &#40;1/27&#41; I submitted a proposal to my client using the Georgia concept. The existing logo &#40;as shown in my original post&#41; was proposed as a universal eKnowledge logo to be communicated to investors. Three market specific logos were also submitted, which included the eKnowledge logo, as shown, accompanied by the above mentioned descriptors &#40;from my second post&#41;. I believe this is the kind of approach Hrant was alluding to: eKnowledge &#40;static/fixed&#41; and descriptor &#40;dynamic/changing&#41;. In addition to having dynamic descriptors, these market specific logos are each assigned a unique color as well. I expect to discuss the project with my client tomorrow &#40;Mon 2/2&#41;, at which time I should have an idea of where I&#39;ll be taking this. <BR> <BR>You have all identified some flaws in the current typeforms, namely, the &#34;e-K&#34; ligature and the &#34;g-e&#34; relationship that is void of a ligature. Originally, I simply thinned out the stem of the &#34;K&#34; to offset its heavy base which is a derivitive of the &#34;e-K&#34; lig. Obviously, from the remarks that have been made I didn&#39;t quite pull it off. The horizontal line over the &#34;e&#34;, which I added after creating the logotype contributes to the heaviness also. I&#39;m still uncertain about whether or not to connect the &#34;g-e&#34; via ligature. Since my initial sketches, I haven&#39;t come up with a way to make it look natural, or rather, indiginous to the original typeface. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know how many of you were on board my personal logo critique for <a href="http://www.creativesqueeze.com" target="_blank">http://www.creativesqueeze.com</a>, but I shared my personal philosophy or practice of trying my best to maintain the integrity of typeforms when using what I consider to be classics. You might say that I will pursuade an existing typeface to conform to my logotype, but I will not ask it to give up its true identity. Georgia must remain Georgia, even if it is eKnowledge Georgia. There are fonts that I don&#39;t have as much respect for and I will treat them more liberally, but Georgia is not one of them. If my client allows me to continue in this direction, I will try my best to work some of your insightful recommendations into the logotype. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tom: <BR> <BR>I used &#34;Mayo&#34; for the business descriptor type. The &#34;e-K&#34; and &#34;g-e&#34; have been my nemisis on this logotype. I have sketched out every connection/disconnection I could think of and come full circle. My current resolve &#40;unless someone here inspires something I haven&#39;t tried yet&#41; is to leave them as is, but with the applied tweaks: &#40;1&#41; slightly nudged the ending &#34;e&#34; to the left, &#40;2&#41; slightly nudged the beginning &#34;e&#34; to the left, decreased the base of the &#34;K&#34;, and slightly nudged the phonetic symbol over the &#34;e&#34; to the left, all to lighten the &#34;e-K&#34; connection a bit. As for color selections: &#40;1&#41; blue is appropriate for the targeted conservative corporate clients, &#40;2&#41; green is appropriate for conveying education, and &#40;3&#41; the third segment is where I thought I would implement a red, which would be appropriate for eye-catching marketing, but it seemed too hard for PR, so I toned it down to a red/blue &#40;a.k.a. purple&#41;. Also, I think purple is a rich &#40;Rich Media Marketing&#41; color. <BR> <BR>Daniel: <BR> <BR>&#34;Rich&#34; Media Marketing is mouthful in itself, but my client ate it up, as a perfect description for the specific marketing services/products offered</div>
