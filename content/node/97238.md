  touch. I'm working on a project where I might get to used it and I would like to
  get a nice compagnon/s for it to be used for display, graphics, but eventually also
  captions and short text... maybe a geometric sans to contrast Vendetta but I'm very
  open\r\n\r\nI came across two examples that i thought were interesting (slabs in
  this case) but once I've put them next to each other it didn't really drive me crazy.
  Moreover I haven't found available fonts close to them. I'm attaching previews if
  you don't feel like navigating away:\r\n\r\n1) Mark Bally's Oberland http://www.marcbally.ch/oberland-slab-light/\r\n2)
  and an exercise i found here http://friendsoftype.com/2010/12/yachts/[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ce2412fa3e6435775a36e347cbe14dff_6532.jpeg]\r\n\r\nAside
  from Vendetta matching issues,  I would be happy to know about available fonts similar
  to Oberland Slab and On the Rag\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ce2412fa3e6435775a36e347cbe14dff_3877.jpeg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/on-the-reg-1250x1250_3961.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Combination_5122.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help!\r\n\r\n"
