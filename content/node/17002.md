    you show a sample?\r\nFrom the cover repro from the <a href=\"http://www.aarpmagazine.org/inprint.html\"
    target=\"new\">AARP The Magazine</a> website, I only see \"The Magazine\" using
    slab serif. (cover thumbnail is too tiny to see anything else)."

    body: Thanks for all your postings. I don't think I've got a name check yet. The
      font is cheekier and less formal than Siseriff LT Std Semibold. The 'e' leans
      a bit and has a humanist quality while the 'a' has a curved slab serif. It is
      a great font and the AARP uses it well. I guess it must be a custom font

  body: This is indeed a custom face from FB, drawn by Cyrus Highsmith. It's a slab
    version of their sans, which was called Antenna last time I checked (which is
    a great name - i hope it sticks). The sans is also used by Poz, Popular Mechanics,
    and another publication or two, and has the extensive range of weights and widths
    one would expect from Font Bureau, but as far as I know the slab is exclusive
    to AARP, at least for the time being.

    it common for FB (and/or other houses) to make designs that are sort of between
    retail and custom, I mean where somebody off the street can't buy it, but more
    than one client uses it? For example are the Poynter fonts sort of like that?
    Or is it simply that the very high prices of such type systems in effect puts
    them de facto outside retail?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
