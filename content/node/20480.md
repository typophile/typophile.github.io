body: "\r\n\r\nHi all. I'm about to embark on my first PROPER development of a typeface
  and I figured I should ask before I get cracking\r\n\r\nFirst off, what are peoples
  recommendations for font creation software? Doens't need to be uber advanced at
  this stage.\r\n\r\nI've done a couple of letters before (a LONG time ago) and remember
  that my typeface was tiny compared to every other font when used in applications.
  Is there a way to get around this?\r\n\r\nIs there a template or format one can
  use to get sizing, etc setup correctly?\r\n\r\nCan you control how characters are
  kerned and leaded within the font file? I'm pretty sure you can, but tell me if
  I'm dreaming ... to include that type of detail in a first font.\r\n\r\nMuchos appreciated.\r\n\r\nPaul\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would look at the fontlab series of tools. There are also free tools but
    I have no experience with them & can't recommend or not recommend them. What kind
    of font do you want to make & why?

  body: Yes, this is a good idea. And maybe you can download the FontLab Studio 5
    user manual from <a href="http://fontlab.com/FontLab-Studio/FontLab-Studio/Download-FontLab-Studio/">this
    site</a>. At the moment it is the best single document about making fonts. It
    also refers to other important web sources. My bet is that it will answer questions
    you haven't even thought of yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)

  body: 'Yet another suggestion for you: I have a very basic program called Type Tool
    and it is a great mini program (compared to FontLab) for a font design - easy
    to use and very intuitive. The user manual is very helpful. I also picked up a
    great book called Designing Type by Karen Cheng and although I''ve only just started
    reading it, it seems like a great resource. Good luck!'
