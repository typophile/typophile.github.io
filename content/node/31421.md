  as font managers. I am currently using ATM Deluxe and I hate it. I have had all
  the usual problems with InDesign not recognizing fonts that other programs do. I
  have always found a quick fix; be it installing fonts through the control panel,
  copying shortcuts of the fonts into secret InDesign Fonts folders, hunting down
  conflicts from PS and TT versions of the same font, etc. But I am running into problems
  more and more, and have decided that somethings gotta give.\r\n\r\nI started looking
  at other font managers and I found a lot of old forums of mix-emotions for each
  program, but no real reasons that one was better than the other.\r\n\r\nAlso, at
  my workplace, there are four typesetter/graphic design hotshots, each sporting their
  own collection of good, bad, and ugly fonts. We also do in-house printing, and the
  prepress guys have a melting pot of everyone's junk fonts. Right now it is every
  man for himself, and the fonts are freaking out. \r\n\r\nFor this reason I have
  lately been looking server-based font management and was wondering if that is pretty
  much the way to go, or pretty much not the way to go... Pros and cons... likes/dislikes...\r\n\r\nFrom
  what I have read, having a single location for fonts to be installed from, with
  restricted access, would eliminate the problem with multiple versions of the same
  font (or \"evil twin\") problems that I keep running in to. Or am I mistaken? It
  would also be nice to restrict the installation of unapproved fonts that one of
  the \"others\" downloaded from \"Bill and Ted's excellent font lab\". As I am led
  to believe, this power can be held by one single dictator, or is all this just wishful
  thinking.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your thoughts."

    to fully evaluate the server aspects.\r\n\r\nSharon"
