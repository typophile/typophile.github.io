  body: hmm Fraktendon seems rather awkward to me, the serifs and blackletter flourishes
    seem to fight for attention while in the above sans version it has a nicer flow
    to it.

  body: The caps in Fraktendon is very awkward in my opinion, but I rather enjoy most
    of the lowercase characters.

  body: "Yes, it is (minus the initial S) Royal Family by Patrick Giasson, originally
    published by Thirstype some time in the mid-late 90s.\r\n\r\nPatrick asked that
    the collection be taken off the market a few years ago, and we complied with his
    wishes. I cannot speak to the reasons for his decision, and perhaps he will post
    in this thread to discuss this choice."
