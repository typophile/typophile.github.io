  received a report from a customer regarding a problem with Lapidaria\r\nMinor Light
  \u2026 On Windows, Lapidaria Minor Light shows up as just Lapidaria. If it is installed
  in addition to the free Lapidaria Medior, it is not possible to\r\naccess both fonts;
  one overwrite the other. \u2026 Windows can handle only regular, bold, italic and
  bold-italic as styles within a family.</cite>\r\n\r\n\u2013 Really??!\r\n\r\nNow
  I wonder:\r\n\u2013 I have other families in stock named individually, no complaints
  so far.\r\n\u2013 on the Mac the family runs perfectly.\r\n\r\nNow here\u2019s a

    Italic, Bold, Bold Italic styles per family only. There's no place for anything
    like Minor or Light. You'd need to move Minor Light to the Family Name and make
    sure that Style Name is exactly one of the above-mentioned four.\r\nYou can assign
    any number and kind of styles via Preferred Family/Style Name on the next Font
    Info page. This then is used e.g. in CS apps.\r\n\r\nYou may also try FOG5's Font
    Info dialog in Easy mode, fill in Family Name and Design Parameters and then check
    in Advanced mode which names it has produced."

    Maior (FontLab info panel / OpenType-specific font names / OT Family Name). This
    would improve the comfort; if the user wants to switch between Minor, Medior and
    Maior, he would do it with the font main menu in Adobe applications. And the weight
    would be changed with the font sub menu. Because I assume, that you did not make
    mistakes with regard to Lapidaria Light only, you have to correct the names of
    the whole family.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to style link the semibold styles to the
    regular styles, the family names of the semibold and the regular styles must be
    Lapidaria Minor, Lapidaria Medior and Lapidaria Maior. And the family names of
    the Lapidaria Light styles must be Lapidaria Minor Light, Lapidaria Medior Light
    and Lapidaria Maior Light. If you don\u2019t want to style link them, the style
    names must be regular in case of all nine styles. If you want to style link regular
    and semibold, the style names of the three semibold styles must be bold and the
    style names of the other six styles must be regular.\r\n\r\nThe thread on the
    FontLab forum is really good. In one of my posts you find links to all technical
    documents, that I have found with regard to the naming.\r\n\r\nThe FontLab info
    panel \"Additional OpenType Names\" is useful, if you really want to have full
    control over the naming."

    of rasterization), though not entirely (uncompromising fonts wouldn't work anywhere),
    and definitely not when it comes to naming: If your fonts are supposed to be Mac-only
    or Adobe-CS-only fonts, all is fine. But if your fonts are supposed to be cross-platform

    would make use of the same name records as Adobe applications, you still should
    care about backwards compatibility. We are not talking about a hack for Windows,
    that might cause problems with your fonts, when Microsoft has addressed \u201Ctypography\u2019s

    other platforms, the specifications or the recommendations of experts like Adam.
    I only wonder, that it was the first time, that you got a bug report. The MAC
    is not the mother of all computers and even for creatives it is not necessarily
    better than Windows.\r\n\r\nAddition to my first post in this thread: I don\u2019t
    style link weights, but uprights and italics only, because in most cases the regular
    weight is style linked to the semibold, but not to the bold weight. If there is
    a bold style in the family, the Office user could accidentally take that instead
    of the semibold weight and the other way around."

    records in the same way, as Adobe actually does on Windows. The user, that has
    posted the bug report to myfonts had not a problem with Lapidaria in the Creative
    Suite, but in Office, OpenOffice, Notepad, Wordpad et cetera. It would be Microsoft\u2019s
    fault, if they would block the development of the specification. Just name the
    fonts according to the specification and they work in Office. It is absurd to
    pass the buck to Microsoft. Microsoft makes use of the namerecords according to
    the OT specification. They often misinterpret specifications, but this time they
    didn\u2019t. If you don\u2019t want to care about applications like Office, it
    is your decision, but not Microsoft\u2019s fault. If you buy a pair of shoes without
    having a look at their size, it is not the fault of the manufacturer, if they
    are too big or too small. Apple is not the measure of all things and Windows neither.\r\n\r\nThe

    style from the text formatting tool bar. If it is something confined to office
    applications (I first though, from the summary, it is a common Windows issue),
    then it is a much less dramatic issue. Though I still it is a software limitation
    (lets not say fault, since apparently some finds it rude), from customer point
    of view it is still the duty of font vendor to work around such limitations, it
    is up to the font designer to choose what applications or use cases he wants to
    support.

    violate the specification just because their fonts don\u2019t work in a program,
    that was developed by people, that don\u2019t care about specifications. In case

    and new font formats to:\r\n\r\n1) work with previously existing apps and OSes\r\n2)
    work with both Mac and Windows\r\n3) display more typographically reasonable behaviors
    (or in this case, names) in savvy apps\r\n\r\nSo we end up with needing to have
    multiple sets of info in the fonts, to handle legacy Mac constraints, legacy Windows
    constraints, and the preferred way we want things to work going forwards.\r\n\r\nMany
    of the most confusing aspects of OpenType font development stem from this issue:
    naming, vertical metrics, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you want font naming to be easier, Apple,
    Microsoft and Linux are the wrong folks to bother:\r\n\r\n1) Neither you nor they
    are likely to be willing to abandon compatibility with existing apps and OSes.\r\n\r\n2)
    If you did want to abandon that, you'd want your approach enshrined in the OpenType
    / Open Font Format specification as well, and you should make your pitch on the
    appropriate mailing lists.\r\n\r\n3) If you are going to work within the existing
    framework of the world, the place to deal with this is in the tools! Adobe has
    already contributed work on *testing* families to show whether the names seem
    to be properly coordinated. What is needed is a framework to make it easier to
    properly coordinate font names across an extended font family in the first place.\r\n\r\nAdam
    Twardoch is one of a handful of people (including me as well) who know this naming
    stuff inside out and backwards, and understands the hassles it creates. He did
    a bunch of research towards this in working on the new Fontographer. Probably
    one of the most useful things they could do in FLS 6 would be to further develop
    this, and if done right could drive some upgrade revenue.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
