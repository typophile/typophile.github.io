  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&#39;ve been wondering, has anybody discerned the logic &#40;assuming it wasn&#39;t formally documented in the first place&#41; of the Petrine reform of Cyrillic at the beginning of the 18th century? Like why was the cap U &#40;the one that looks like a big Latin lc &#34;y&#34;&#41; left/made into a form different than the Latin cap &#34;Y&#34;&#42;, while something like the EM was made totally Latin? Was there some system to it? <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, wassup with the code point 04AE in Unicode? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">Have you read Vladimir Yefimov&#39;s essay on the Petrine Civil Type in <i>Language Culture Type</i>? It doesn&#39;t directly address the capital U question, but it does provide a fairly detailed history of the reform. Of course, at the final stage Peter the Great simply picked up a pen and crossed out a pile of stuff: alphabet reform by royal fiat, and I don&#39;t suppose the Tsar felt any need to explain himself. <BR> <BR>You might also track down volumes 3:4 &#40;1969&#41; and 4:2 &#40;1970&#41; of the journal <i>Visible Language</i>, which contain a two-part essay on &#39;The Genesis of Russian Grazhdanskii Shrift or Civil Type&#39; by Ivan L. Kaldor. I don&#39;t have my copies to hand, so I can&#39;t check what information they might include about the alphabet reform. Kaldor was principally interested in identifying the specific Latin types on which the Civil Type was based. <BR> <BR><i>BTW, wassup with the code point 04AE in Unicode?</i> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s used in the Cyrillic orthographies of Azerbaijani, Bashkir and Kalmyk. Take a look at the lowercase form, U&#43;04AF. I&#39;m not sure when this developed. All three languages were written in variants of the Latin script in the 1920s and 1930s, until Stalin decided that the USSR should be a Cyrillic-only zone. But if you take a look at the images at <a href="http://www.pmicro.kz/~library/unicode/index.html">this site</a>, taken from M.I. Isaev&#39;s <i>Yazykovoe strointel&#39;stvo v SSSR</i>, you&#39;ll see that the &#39;Y&#39; is shown with a typical Russian U form. It is difficult to tell whether this represents the form used for these languages in the 1920s and 1930s or if this was simply what Isaev had available in 1979.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Obviously, I haven&#39;t read Yefimov&#39;s chapter yet. :-/ <BR>I&#39;ll have to bump it up my reading list... In fact I can make it second in line &#40;after part 3 of that Ovink thing&#41;, not least because Typophile threads get &#34;closed&#34; after a month of inactivity... <BR> <BR>And thanks for the VL references. I recently finished &#34;mining&#34; Quaerendo all the way back to the beginning, and VL/JoTR can be next. Long live UCLA! Well, at least their libraries... <BR> <BR>&#62; at the final stage Peter the Great simply picked up a pen and crossed out a pile of stuff <BR> <BR>That&#39;s what I suspected. But I guess the preparatory stuff by &#34;advisors&#34; did guide the process to a large extent &#40;at least I hope so&#41;. Nonetheless, what might be called the erratic, &#34;human&#34; nature of the process probably resulted in some strangeness. For example, for the cap U, I wonder if Peter saw a lc Latin &#34;y&#34;, and since it&#39;s &#34;tall&#34; he thought it was a cap, and he just took a fancy to it? But this is mostly just my imagination for now - I&#39;ll read up that material soon. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62; 04AE <BR>&#62; Take a look at the lowercase form <BR> <BR>Huh, it looks like a van Krimpen Greek gamma. <BR> <BR>&#62; All three languages were written in variants of the Latin script in the 1920s and 1930s <BR> <BR>It seems that this is what would have made them used a more Latin form, although <BR>that lc is still strange - maybe it was to differentiate it from the mainstream/Russian form. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

All three languages use this straight-leg form <i>and</i> the typical Cyrillic U. In the new Azerbaijani Latin orthography &#40;1992&#41;, the latter is written <i>u</i> while the straight-leg letter is written as <i>&uuml;</i>. I&#39;m not sure of the exact phonetic value.</div>
