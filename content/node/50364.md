body: "I'm working on a logo for a company that currently does embroidery promotional
  gifts (caps, T-shirts etc.). Right now their logo is second to non existing. They
  want to have one. I was playing a bit with the idea and came up with a few. Three
  of them are presented in the PDF. If you could comment on them.\r\n\r\nSo the logo
  should reflect professional promotional gift producing company that may handle complicated
  custom made works. Since I know them personally I know they are very dedicated and
  very accurate at their work. So their products are really fine produced.\r\n\r\nBTW.
  Name as in logo #1 hides a word \"stitch\" (in our language), their original line
  of work. That's why I was thinking not to go completely into embroidery symbol since
  the name implies on it already. And I know that the end result will contain at least
  three basic colours (red, blue and yellow).\r\n\r\nI would like to know which of
  these is worth pursuing if any at all. And if they also maybe remind you of any
  other logo."

    industry. From the versions of 1, which I would like to see with your thoughts
    of colour if it is to have the red, blue and yellow, I can see a, possibly too
    obvious, play on stitch and hyphen but I don't get a complicated, passionate,
    detailed approach, maybe seen with product(s) or in a context with them it could
    work in the way a simple versus complex juxtaposition. Of the three I would pursue
    the first to develop with the aim of refinement but also to see if anything else
    strikes you in that direction.\r\n\r\nTim"

    that in my next refinement.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I'm also sending some other
    ideas I've been playing with for a bit. YOu can also comment on this if you like.
    I guess that most of them are better than #2 and #3 were in the first preliminaries.\r\n\r\nThey
    are deliberately numbered with letters so I won't get confused whether they are
    related to the first or this post.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo

    Less letter spacing and a bit thicker lines.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think so far?

    It should be ok since embroidery is almost never smaller than 3cm (depending whether
    it's vertical or horizontal).\r\n\r\nI'll send business card design as well when
