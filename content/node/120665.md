  to this one at least. This is at the entrance of the Monument to the Battle of the

  body: " Completed in 1913 for the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig, also
    known as the Battle of the Nations. The statues of the monument were sculpted
    by Christian Behrens and his apprentice Franz Metzner who finished the remaining
    statues after Behrens's death in 1905. This suggests that the Jugendstyl/Art Nouveaule
    lettering is an original design by Christian Behrens  and/or Franz Metzner.\r\nThis
    style of lettering was very fashionable in Germany and elsewhere before WW I.\r\nThe
    specimen books of German foundries included a fair number of similar styles. Most
    have not been digitized.\r\nA few digitized similars are Belgravia http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/belgravia/
    \ Ortem http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/ortem/ Brillant http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rmu/brillant/
    Eckmann   https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eckmann/ \r\n\r\nBTW the phrase
    \"GOTT MIT UNS\" was widely used by the German Army, including on the belt buckles
    of German soldiers.\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
