  a quote from Walt Whitman? I'd like a handwritten look, but his actual handwriting
  doesn't seem right (not to mention I don't have a sample of a handwritten version
  of  this poem.)\r\nSo the basics, I guess, are 19th century, masculine, a sense
  of vitality and energy, artistic, not too formal, maybe somewhat idiosyncratic?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any ideas you may have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
