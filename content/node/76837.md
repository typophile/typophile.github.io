  body: "I am very glad to see this post, as I have wondered about this myself. I
    think I had a relatively early dawning of \"typographical awareness\" and I have
    yet to encounter a math or science text that uses text figures (proportional oldstyle,
    or even oldstyle at all). I have occasionally typeset texts with small amounts
    of math and used them, but I'm not sure what I would do for an extensively mathematic
    text. As much as I would like to use oldstyle figures, I feel that only titling
    figures are accepted in these technical areas, in a way similar to how only one
    form of the theta is recognized as a mathematical symbol, or only one form of
    the lowercase g is used in IPA transcriptions. However, I don't know for sure
    why this is, and indeed, I'm very curious. My best guess is that mathematicians,
    scientists, etc. may see it as a legibility problem for certain characters, but
    I think overall equations and charts look both more attractive and more easily
    scannable/readable when set in OSF. Anyway, it's a very interesting topic. I look
    forward to more responses.\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "I'm involved in scientific research as my \"day job,\" and have been intrigued
    by this question before, as well.\r\n\r\nI once read a book by Werner Heisenberg
    (reprinted by Dover: http://www.amazon.com/Physical-Principles-Quantum-Theory/dp/0486601137/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1291176215&sr=8-1)
    that used text figures in the equations. It was mostly legible, with the exception
    of the 0 and the 1. Specifically, the 0 looked too much like a lc /o/ (which is
    occasionally used to, for example, indicate an element of solid angle -- anyone
    who tells you /o/ is never used as a variable or operator is lying) and the 1
    of the typeface used looked too much like some variant of a small caps /I/, which
    would make someone question if that is how they choose to indicate the imaginary
    unit at first glance -- not a good thing to be confused about!\r\n\r\nMy personal
    thoughts are to avoid text figures in equations. First, most of the target audience
    for such material is not used to looking at text figures in type. As a result,
    it distracts from the content when the figures are different than what the reader
    looks at day in and day out. Second, some text figures suffer from the ambiguities
    noted with the Heisenberg book above, though that can be fixed through appropriate
    selection of the typeface. Finally, once one delves into science mathematics beyond,
    say, the high school level there are few numbers in most equations -- equations
    at this level are mostly combinations of variables and operators, both upper and
    lowercase (and often with uc and lc greek and sans/serif/blackletter in one equation!).
    When a number appears, there is no reason why it should blend in with the lowercase.
    If anything, it should stand out as a pure number in a sea of variables, and make
    the reader wonder what quirk of calculus made it appear there."

  body: "IMHO, the lining option is far better than the oldstyle for scientific data.
    BTW, I think even in common text OsF is not always the better choice, although
    there is a solid general opinion favouring them.\r\n\r\nThese figures are more
    distinctive and elegant, but become distracting if the text has lots of numbers.
    The argument about x-height of OsF to match lc is valid. But when you have a text/language
    with many ascenders, numbers with descenders may become a bit strange or appear
    misaligned. This may not be an issue for English, where |y| is very common and
    increases the descender frequence. But for Italian or Portuguese, languages with
    much less descender usage, this may cause OsF 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9 not to fit so well
    to the text.\r\n\r\nBesides this, sequences of figures with ascenders (like 886),
    in a passage without other numbers, may give the idea of a lining standard (and
    even to be set in bigger type size) for the average reader.\r\n\r\nJust for literature
    I have no doubt to take OsF as a primary choice.\r\n\r\nBetween disciplines from
    which I handled some amout of material, I never saw OsF figures used for Mathematics
    or Biology. But I saw some books about Philosophy, History or Law using OsF. For
    these, OsF just work if few numbers were present. About chess notation, I tried
    to do this when editing a small chess magazine, but had to give it up. There is
    so much amount of lining characters in chess notation and this makes OsF appear
    very small and shifted towards bottom.\r\n\r\nAn interesting possibility is to
    have figures in an intermediary size. Let's say, a lining which matches uc height,
    an oldstyle which matches lc x-height and a third set using lining numbers with
    height mid-sized between x- and X-height."

  body: "I think the biggest aesthetic problem with text figures in this situation
    is their varied vertical alignment: for instance, see the 4/3 fraction in the
    denominator of the fifth large fraction. The fraction bar appears to be closer
    to the 4 than the 3 \u2014 which, of course, it is. If the numerator and denominator
    of the small fraction had several more digits, the effect might disappear, but
    it's very noticeable with only the two digits. Of course, a fraction like f/e,
    for instance, gives you the same problem. I recall a math text that adjusted the
    numerator and denominator baselines to avoid this issue:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mathfractions_6112.jpg]\r\n\r\nAn
    interesting solution, but it made equations with several fractions look inconsistent
    and haphazard.\r\n\r\nIn the useful examples provided by SciTechEngMath, the oldstyle
    figures don't help the legibility of fractions and superscripts, certainly, but
    I definitely like the look of them in a line of text. For instance, I actually
    think 4\u03C0 looks very nice with OSF as does any nonfractional term with a combination
    of digits and variables. OSF next to italic lc letters or lc Greek letters is,
    I think, very attractive. I recall that Bringhurst's chapter on page proportions
    had a bit of math (also, like the examples above, in Minion) and used OSF \u2014
    but this was all inline, I think, and didn't include anything as complicated as
    the above. I thought of it, though, because of the frequent use of \u03C0 and
    \u03C6 (he uses the letter, I think, not the math symbol \u03D5), which look quite
    nice with OSF.\r\n\r\nJosh"

    That would be very effective when there is only one or at the most two fractions

    \u03C6 (two stroke versus single stroke lc \"phi\"). I have seen both used in
    various contexts in both papers and books. The one I see the most is the two stroke
    form (\u03D5), which is almost invariably the one selected for the azimuthal coordinate
    of a spherical coordinate system and is also frequently used for the electric
    potential in certain literature. When I see the one stroke form (\u03C6) it has
    usually been in the context of quantum mechanics to represent a wave function,
    and is sometimes mixed in expressions with the two stroke version when they wish
    to use spherical coordinates (i.e., the two stroke form represents the azimuthal
    coordinate while the one stroke represents the wave function, so you may have
    some perverse form like \u03C6(\u03D5)). I was unaware of there being much of
    a convention regarding this.\r\n\r\nCould you please share what you know about
    the choice between the two forms?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    comment regarding me getting the two backward: it appears as though several fonts
    on my system have the two reversed or, as is the case with how Typophile is presently
    displaying for me, identical. Inspection of the page element with the trusty UnicodeChecker.app
    shows that the page has character U+03C6 when I mention the single stroke form,
    and U+03D5 when I mention the two stroke form. Experimentation shows that Lucida
    Grande (among others) has the correct forms in the correct spots, whereas Adobe
    Garamond Premier Pro (among others, including all of the Japanese faces I have

  body: "I do remember that in one British book - I think it was \"Teach Yourself
    Calculus\" - there were log tables in the back which were set using oldstyle figures
    rather than ranging figures.\r\n\r\nSo, while for reasons outlined above, oldstyle
    figures are generally inappropriate for complex equations (in addition, 0 and
    1 could easily be confused with small capital O and I, again because of lack of
    context) in older works, where oldstyle figures were the norm, they would be used
    where feasible.\r\n\r\nThe Doctrine of Fluxions, by James Hodgson, and published
    in 1736, and available on Google Books, is set in Caslon, and although this textbook
    on calculus has equations in it, it uses oldstyle figures in them; back when Caslon
    was what people used when they set type, that's what they used for equations too,
    and they managed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when it is merely tabular matter instead
    of equations, oldstyle figures are not a problem, which is why they've been used
    even in recent works. For an old example, Astronomia Accurata, or the Royal Astronomer
    and Navigator, by Robert Heath, from 1760, also on Google Books, might be commended.\r\n\r\nAs
    an example of the early use of ranging figures in mathematics, Mathematical Treatises,
    by the Reverend John West, dating from 1838 might be noted - it is set in Bell,
    apparently.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Cours d'Analyse de l'\xC9cole Polytechnique,
    by Jean-Marie-Constant Duhamel, dating from 1841, although set in Bodoni, uses
    oldstyle figures throughout.\r\n\r\nThese are just a few random examples, of course."
