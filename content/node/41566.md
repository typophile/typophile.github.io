  \u2026 Is there a technical term for those? I've looked through Rob Roy Kelly's
  book, but didn't find anything there.\r\n\r\nAlso, do side-brackets a Tuscan make?
  Or does there need to be at least some kind of stroke bifurcation or splaying? For

    strict definition of \"tuscan\" is a type with split or bifurcated stems, for
    example:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/de-louisville/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/frisco-antique-display-sg/\r\n\r\nMyfonts
    appear to have revised their definition of \"tuscan\" not too long ago. It used
    to be assigned as a key word to wood type and Victorian faces with bands of vertical
    stressing but ordinary stems (not split), for example:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/go-west/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-rodeo/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/spaghetti-western-wbw/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/ouachita-way-wbw/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/rio-grande-wbw/\r\n\r\nTypes
    with the thorn feature and/or bands of vertical stressing are correctly named
    wood types, or classified as Victorian:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/go-west/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/opera-house/\r\nis
    a true tuscan due to its split stems and genreally bifurcated outline.\r\n\r\nj

  body: "My guess as to what is happening on MyFonts is that foundries are spotting
    the <cite>tuscan</cite> keyword on other wood types and adopting it for their
    own fonts without knowing what it is really, other than a \"Wild Western\" thing.
    Generally though, the keyword application on MyFonts seems more or less to the
    point: [[http://www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/tuscan/]]\r\n\r\nOne other interesting
    example which I spotted in Rob Roy Kelly's book was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/gothic-tuscan-round/|Gothic
    Tuscan Round]]. Following this naming, the pointy side-brackets <em>do</em> make
    for a tuscan (or at least a Gothic Tuscan); but for my own purposes, I'm not sure
    I'm about to adopt that logic wholeheartedly just yet.\r\n\r\nTo further confuse
    matters, there is a whole other class of tuscans which are less bifurcated than
    they are just concave:\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/gothic-tuscan/|Gothic
    Tuscan]]\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/antique-tuscan/|Antique

    Tuscan]]\r\n\r\nBut I'm getting off topic a bit here. Of course any related discussion
    is welcome, but I'm mostly interested hearing if people think the presence of
    these spur\u2026 er\u2026 <em>thorns</em>\u2026 are enough to endow a face with
    the classification of <cite>Tuscan</cite>."

    I be not the only person wondering what the name for this things is!\r\n\r\nI
    tend to like <cite>spur</cite> or <cite>thorn</cite> because they can exist independently
    from the concept of <cite>Tuscan</cite> if need be.\r\n\r\n<cite>Thorn</cite>
    is slightly limiting, as it implies sharpness. Similarly, the <cite>bulge</cite>
    suggested in that previous thread is limiting because it implies, well, bulginess
    (wow, my spell check let that word pass).\r\n\r\nIt is too bad that <cite>spur</cite>
    is already in use for another typo-term (not that there aren't a million typo-homographs
    already) \u2026 maybe I'll add a <cite>side-</cite> prefix to it and call it a
    day: <strong><cite>side-spur</cite></strong>\r\n\r\nI mean after all, it is vaguely
    similar, formally, to the other kind of spur, right? The main difference is that
    it happens on the side of the letter."
