  with two Indian teachers. With a humble start of workshops and camps, Aksharaya
  has today become a beacon of achievement and inspiration to many. It is the unconditional
  contribution, love and efforts of its founder that has led this organisation to
  find a place of respect and become a source of learning for its members. \r\n\r\n'Ichha'-
  the motto\r\nThe history of Indian scripts dates back 5000 years. In India, 10 different
  scripts are identified from which are derived 22 languages (spoken and written).
  \r\nThrough Aksharaya as an organisation we aim for the three E\u2019s: Expand,
  Educate and Explore. Expand- promote 'letter' as a concept and its forms. Educate-
  aware the people, both professionals and students, giving them opportunities learn
  and appreciate through various activities like camps\t and workshops.\r\nExplore-
  research and development of Indian script, calligraphy and typography\r\n\r\n'Karma'-
  the work\r\nInterestingly, all Indian scripts follow a common phonetic system. Thus,
  it is assumable that there still lay many hidden facts that the world including
  us has still to discover about these scripts. So to rightly connect these Scripts
  & their culture through intention, thoughts and philosophy there is a need for an
  organization- Aksharaya. Its contribution is to work in (concept) Letter forms and
  its related issues, Script study, Calligraphy, Type Designing, Typography, and also
  Literature (in relation) being some of the many fields. But while its vision remains
  vast, its mission begins with identifying and connecting various resources to the
  people."

    word, etc.) is attested in old Sanskrit texts, and the adjective \"aksharya\"
    (= relating to letter, word, gana), though very rare, is also attested in old
    texts, but I cannot find any attestation for \"aksharaya\" in Sanskrit.\r\n"

    get in the dictionary or online. We have coined this term for our organization. '
