  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi

I thought fellow typophiles might like to see the attached pdf for the most recent iteration of my Eternal font.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ideal_3876.jpg]

I think I'm finally beginning to crack the numerals: gosh they've been a struggle!

Please feel free to crit! 

Specifically I'm not sure if the small caps are dark enough.

Also, I'm wondering about certain shapes: M, B, Q, T, Z, a, f, x, y, Ae and Th.

I realise some of the shapes are not merged where contours cross. Not sure what happened to the threequarters fraction. Also some of the accented characters need to be recomposed with the current base characters.

Is Uhorn allowed to have its serif missing like that? Does the contextual alternate r work?

Does the spacing work? What about the smallcap spacing?

Thanks a lot :) </div>

I like the Th. The leg on the M could be toned down a bit more to make it more consistent with the R or X, for example, but I do like it the way it is.

I feel like the baseline is a little uneven in the text samples--the v and w seem to hang down a little too low, for example.

Why Thai?

The "i" terminal has a point in the middle (not sure if this is the correct english) that I dont find in any other terminal. Error or something that you want?

The way you mention the lc as mostly working makes me think I need to spend more time on the uc. Would you like a swashy tail on the Q? Is it the top of the t that bothers you?

Antonio, yes, I don't know when that point appeared in the tail of the i but it probably needs to get lost. Thanks for pointing out the x. I think I've pushed the limbs too far apart.

I'm making the smallcaps a few units heavier and increasing the sidebearings. Also I had lots of discretionary ligatures in an old version which need redrafting.

Thanks very much guys :) Please do give me your worst!</div>

Actually it's just that I spent more time (but not much
yet frankly) looking at the lc, and that's because the lc
is 95% of text.

		<div class="commentbody">This is looking pretty good.

Two small things jumped out in a first look:

1) Seems there are overlapping paths for the crossbars of t and f, and perhaps their ligatures. This is visible at some zoom levels in Acrobat 9 when the overlapped sections reverse out.

2) To my eye, optically the S and s seem to lean just slightly to the left. Given the traditional Roman forms being used, I'd think they should either be balanced, or if they lean, go ever so slightly to the right.

Cheers,

'x' still is very distracting - in fact the curves (though handsome in themselves) only add to the torquing that comes from the offset not aligning optically.

I'm not sure about the 'A' crossbar not connecting. I fear that reduces the versatility of this font quite a bit. ('B' & 'R' are fine on that score, I think.)

Tail of the oldstyle '3' looks kinda limp!

x...oh dear! I wondered why it still looked like the arms were too far apart even though I'd brought them inwards. Think I need to come back to this one!

VXY, I don't know. The serif needed tension with the heavy stroke. On those letters the stroke is rotated so the serif seemed to fit best rotated too. I'll have another look at that.

		<div class="commentbody">Ben,
your font is very nice, charming and comfortably legible. 

Texts are easy to read and vibrant, so one experiments the delight of reading by –paradoxically– ignoring that the type face contributes or, even better, produces that feeling.

I agree with Craig about the crossbar of the uc A (and probably the same for the ∆), and the optical disalignment in the uc/lc x –glyphs which however  I loved, the same as delicious D, R, U, V, W, Y, Z, n, v, w, z and old style numerals–; I think the thin stroke gap (very noticeable at a large size) should not exceed one quarter of its width.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/X_5508.png]

I also believe like Hrant, that your Q could be more quirky; I enjoy the correction made to the t: now it absolutely fits the elegance of its sisters.

Nevertheless, your work is really amazing for both brain hemispheres.

Let us know when it's for sale.

<em>[Just a minor thing, beyond the design: the æ/Æ and Œ/œ are not exactly ligatures in the original meaning of the word, but distinct letters; by the other hand, the German ß is a real one –long s over round s–, with the notable fact that the ſ (long s) does not exist anymore in German.]</em>


<strong>MarS</strong>

PS: Next time, merge outlines, please; it's a shame not to enjoy so wonderful creation because of bad PDF rendering. BTW, at some scales, Acrobat seems strangely to miss some characters, as António told before.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I suppose it'd also be helpful to address your questions!

<em>Specifically I’m not sure if the small caps are dark enough.</em>

They do look very slightly light in color, but they also seem large to me, so adding weight might make them too loud. It's kind of a tricky question with this font, because your lowercase is (I think) more condensed than your uppercase: should the small caps likewise squeeze together like their short brethren or should they retain more typical width like their cap antecedents?

<em>Also, I’m wondering about certain shapes: M, B, Q, T, Z, a, f, x, y, Ae and Th.</em>

B, a, and f look great to me. Those other caps aren't easy to find in your text setting so they're harder to judge.
More space between the T-part and the h-part of 'Th' might be helpful.

<em>Does the spacing work? What about the smallcap spacing?</em>

Letterspacing looks too tight all around to me (maybe smallcaps especially). Difficult to read, though, because I think the wordspacing is too large. This in turn is difficult to judge because you have fully justified the paragraphs, so maybe that excess space is in part due to the layout stretching the lines. But even in the most crammed line, I think the letters looked too bunched and the space between words relatively too large. What's a rag-right paragraph look like?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Marcelo, thanks for your positive comments! I'm glad you like my font! 
I did wonder about the crossbar on A, but initial comments when I posted the start of this font were positive about the disconnected stroke, so I left it. Perhaps it needs to evolve again.
It's interesting you like the D as that was one that didn't really seem to work for me. What do you like about it in particular?

>I think the thin stroke gap (very noticeable at a large size) should not exceed one quarter of its width.

Do you mean I should reduce the gap in the B and R <strong>by</strong> a quarter or <strong>to</strong> a quarter of its current width?

I hadn't thought of this as saleable! I wouldn't have a clue how to do that (it's my first font) so when I'm nearer completion I'll need someone to help with that I guess :)

Yes, I did wonder if Ae and Oe should count as ligatures. I'll move them into the latin extended set and get the sharp s moved into the ligatures section! Thanks.

Sorry sorry sorry about the overlap problem. I like to keep the outlines un-merged until I'm sure they are finalised! 

Can you tell me what outlines are missed in Acrobat (I haven't noticed any problems) and I'll check the unicode indexes.

I just noticed yesterday the word spacing too. Good to have my thoughts confirmed. I'll knock a bit off there.
Thanks,</div>

That's a good question, Craig. Looking at the PDF, I think the small-cap A is definitely too wide. I think condensing the small caps might just be what the doctor ordered.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This has charm and some nice drawing. I think it has some craft problems, though, that need to be resolved to make it work in text. 

The verticals are, I suspect a little too light. And for sure the spacing is too tight for text sizes. When I zoom in on the 'in' combo, for example, I see that the space between letters is only 80% of the width of the n counter. In Minion, which is a tightly spaced text font, the space between two n's (stem-to-stem) is 95% of the width of the counter--actually the amount that Walter Tracy recommends in his great "Letters of Credit".   

Handling the widths of your mnh is tricky with the hooked right foot. I wonder if the h or n are a trifle wide. The m to me is definitely cramped. It is hard to judge these things, though, with the letter spacing so tight. 

The light verticals go with the tight spacing to make this very good large--though even there it could be a little looser. But the tightness really hurts at text size. 

9-12 point is really a different animal than big, and what it looks like best on the screen will deceive you about what is best small.       </div>

I think I've been looking too long at it on screen and not enough in print. I think the serifs may also need strengthening for small text use. I wasn't intending to do optical sizes so it looks like I have a decision to make!

Do you know the percentage letterspacing vs counter width for the display cut of Minion?

I'll redo the spacing completely. It's good to hear there's a bit of a convention as I was trusting just my (amateur) judgment so far. I'll leave the hnm as they are until the spacing is fixed.

This is exactly the feedback I need, many thanks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the feedback. I'm taking one step at a time :) The next step (after getting the spacing and glyphs right) will be learning how hinting works, wondering what else needs to go into a font, and finally working out what this font is good for and getting advice on marketing and distribution (if it turns out good enough to sell). The other thing is that I'd want to have at least the italic ready as well before thinking about licensing.
Fonting is a very painstaking process. I suspect there's still a whole lot of work to do on this!</div>

—To my eyes, the lack of the bottom serif makes it originally exciting; in context, it keeps its own balance and elegance. I don't know if you kerned it, but in your sample text, the wide space between the D and the o makes me tend to read "D own" instead of the right word. But probably it's because the entire spacing is very tight (BTW, I'd reconsider this).

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting. I did a little experiment measuring glyphs in pdfs...

I've compared the letterspacing with the counterspacing for a handful of fonts as William noted above.

The tightest spacing is in Fedra Serif Display, where the space between two n's is just 63% of the space between the n's legs. Palatino comes in next at 72%.

The loosest spacing is in Enschedé Collis, which is 102%.
Melior LT comes in at 100%

A modern display font (Guardian Egyptian Display) turned out at 77% and fonts with condensed proportions seemed to have wider spacing: Newlyn's Verona and Joanna MT had 91 and 93%

Fonts like Type Together's Karmina, Underware's Dolly, ITC Stone Serif, and Guardian Egyptian Text had ratios of 85-87%.

The median was 89%. Fedra Serif text, FF Olsen and Utopia have this ratio.

<strong>Conclusion:</strong>
For a text size, I think I'll aim for a 90% ratio of spacing to counterspace,  or another 20 units on each side of my n, and see how that looks as a starting point. Putting in the extra space means the serifs look stumpy and will need lengthening. 

I'll keep developing the existing font as a display cut and come to the text size afterwards (if I don't grow tired of beziers!)

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Marcelo; I'll try that. My reason for the curves was that the other letters which I like best have slight curves and modulations in them and the wxyz looked a bit flat and mechanical for a humanist-influenced font. I might try also just one curve continuing on both arms rather than an opposite curve on each arm. I'm finding this silly letter really hard, just like o was initially for me. 

It's funny because they're essentially very simple shapes and you wouldn't imagine much could go wrong with them! Oh, how many things about type design seem so simple before you start actually developing a font! :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ben, I think what works best as far as letter spacing is also affected by how thick the stems are, and how wide the font is overall, as well as the serifs--and the intended size of use. 

One way to proceed is to print it out at intended size, and then try tracking it out and in, and see what works best. Because the different factors interact in ways that nobody fully understands, you just need to try variations and use your eyes any your own personal judgment. This is the approach Briem recommends on his web site, and I think it's right. 

I would also recommend comparing thickness of stem, normalized for x height, with other faces you admire, and also play with this in your own font, with a limited set of letters, and in print-out look also at the affect on letter spacing.  

How wide your n and o are, the weight of their strokes, and their spacing is a lot of the 'DNA' of your font, so I agree with Tracy that it is worth taking time over to make sure you are happy with it. </div>

The problem with the initial PDF is that there are some isolated outlines  embedded among the text –I mean, outlined text, instead of the font itself– that cause Reader renders unexpectedly; it is probably related to overlapping unmerged outlines within the font.
I apologize myself for distracting from the core point, but I thought it is worth to learn a bit from “artifacts”.

As some were saying in forums elsewhere (about other fonts/types), if you intend to develop this as a text face, I wouldn't be afraid to lean a bit towards tighter spacing. 

I had the opposite reaction in terms of spacing from your sample: that if anything the spacing was too loose. I think there was some unevenness or kerning work to be done with the spacing, but I wasn't left with a global impression of it being too loose.

So, first you find the spacing too loose, and then you wasn't left with the impression of it being too loose? ;)
  
At any rate, a text face will pretty much always need looser spacing than a display face. So since this face was -- as far as I know -- intented for text, the spacing shouldn't be too tight. I think it might either be just right or slightly too tight as it is right now (I'm talking about a few units here). But I'm not an expert on spacing, really. :)</div>

<em>At any rate, a text face will pretty much always need looser spacing than a display face.</em> 

I guess there's text and then there's text. Who knows? It's a subjective thing in the end. I like text tighter--I think if it's spaced too much, you lose a certain amount of "chunking".

I agree with you, though, in that it's just about right now overall, with a little bit of wiggle room.</div>

You could say it's subjective in the display realm* but when it comes to text you can't let the counters overpower the interletter space. Based on the current preference for tight display setting, it's entirely fair to say "text fonts need to be tighter than display fonts".

* One could imagine a future where people prefer loose titling.

Right--I see what you're saying with that. I guess the issue for me was that, <em>overall</em>, the spacing seemed about right, but there's some unevenness--some of it seemed too tight, but other areas seemed a bit too loose (e.g., "Do" and "ow", as Marcelo points out). Because the more spaced pairs were dragging my gaze, the idea of increasing the spacing equally throughout didn't quite seem right to me--maybe redistributing or something. </div>

Hrant, do you mean looser?

I guess the spacing ended up looking tight because I've read a lot of Plantin and Palatino!

This seems more subjective than I thought. I think what I'll do next is print out at various sizes up to say 144pt, play with the tracking and see which size the font shines best at, then optimise the spacing and stem widths for that. I'll have to trust my eye in the end.

William, yes, I'll look at stem widths too, for the same set of fonts. 

I haven't done any kerning yet.

The only real rule here is that you need to look at your design in the final intended size and medium (print, computer screen, phone). Then it's your font, you decide. And next of course customers decide if they want it.

Indeed. A very good point, usually lost.

Talking of stroke offset, what about the 8? You can also see in the pdf (the bigger offset is in the lining figures and the narrow offset in the oldstyle ones).

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Ben, I'm really chiming in late!
I like this a lot. It feels very friendly and charming but serious and down-to-earth at the same time, and it seems to read quite fluidly, although I agree it is a bit tight.

FWIW (add salt), the main thing I'm wondering about is your mixture of "hard/determined" and "soft/flowing" features, especially apparent in the terminals (like in the two versions of the "y" you just posted).
Just observing: The terminals that you have on the foot of the "a", as well as the right sides of hmn etc., feel very soft and bring a nicely flowing feel to this; in contrast, the "harder" terminals on the top of the "a", the "c" and the "s" seem quite determined and I'm not quite sure how they tie in with the softer, maybe more calligraphic model outlined in other terminals/serifs.

I like your "A" a lot – especially the non-connecting crossbar, which connects nicely (and unexpectedly) with the tail of the "g". I'm not so sure about the right side foot serif; it looks beautiful (also in keeping with the "soft/flowing" theme), but to my eyes it makes that diagonal look like it's slanting out a bit (there's a similar thing happening in the "Y" and "V"). Maybe pull the diagonal back a bit?
I'm a bit sad your "Æ" doesn't seem to echo that beautiful "A" shape that much. It looks like it's based on a flat-topped "A"; also the crossbar not connecting on the other side looks a bit distracting to me. But maybe that's just me!
Oh, and might the "Œ" clog?

Some of your ligs seem a bit too tight (the "ffi" jumps out in "efficient" on p. 3).

BTW, great to see a cap eszett in here! Love the shape. There seems to be something slightly wonky about its contrast, but I can't pinpoint it exactly. :-/

Anyway – this is beautiful. I'm looking forward to see it grow even more.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Har, thanks Nina ;)
Interesting about the hard/soft tension. The first version of y seemed always not quite strong enough at the base, a bit weedy, and I couldn't quite get it to work in my opinion. Maybe it just needed to swell more, will keep going anyway with that one.

The toes on adhiklmnu always wanted to be curly and I have considered making them more normal but they are still resisting, happily. I think with the t and y, I've been influenced by the italic which you can probably find an earlier version of on the previous Eternal thread. I found working backwards from that helped clarify that this looked good with a pen influence, as well as helping out with the stress and letter skeletons. I quite like the unexpected dynamic that's created between the chocolatey serifs, cursive toes and occasional abrupt terminals.

Yes, A looks too wide, thanks for clarifying that as it was in the back of my mind. I need to do something more exciting with its apex as well. I softened the heavy stroke of v with a bit of a curve so that might transpose onto the A, or not...

Do you think Æ needs to be based on the triangular A rather than on the square A and E equally? I'll experiment with it anyway. Œ is a horrible glyph I agree. I need to decide whether it's an O coming out of an E or an E coming out of an O. There's far too much black in the corners.

The ligs will be loosened.

And I'm glad you like the cap eszett. Again, I haven't really put as much time into that one yet so it needs some polishing. Wonky, yes :)

Thank you for your positive crit!</div>

I might as well just jump in again :P

I like that <strong>y</strong> experiment. Actually prefer it over the old one I think.
I've always thought that the old one was probably too fiddly and maybe too light as well. I quickly looked up what I commented about the <strong>y</strong> in the previous thread:

<em>"[..]And the bottom terminal could use a little love, maybe an increase of weight, I don’t know exactly."
--
"[..] But I agree the terminal might be a bit too fiddly. One thing that would help, is making the right stroke plus tail a bit heavier. It looks too light, eventhough it’s probably of the same weight as your typeface’s lightest parts."</em>

So I think that your new solution might be the best, although I would still experiment with it a little. But I think the overall shape of the terminal is the way to go. :)

Regarding the <strong>8</strong> you posted, for me they are actually leaning to the left, something I think I also posted in the old thead (if my memory serves me well). So that one still needs a bit of tinkering. Going over the PDF, the cap <strong>S</strong> also leans slightly to the left.

For more comments I will have to take a look at the PDF a bit better at a later moment. :) But it is really shaping up very nicely!</div>

Craig, I don't much like Goergia, but you think the stroke should join closer? I felt with a nonvertical stress the intersection couldn't be very horizontal...but it still could be less offset. Difficult to design the numerals, unfortunately :)

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">OK, I've finally had time to take a closer look!

First, some macro stuff:
- As I said before (and others did too) there's a very satisfying balance between utility and flair; things like the "M" might seem capricious, but I think that's the right spirit.
- I'd say this is shooting for 10 point (with well-balanced ascenders vs descenders). As such, the color is fine, but the spacing is too tight overall (although it's too uneven to be entirely sure).
- I actually think the smallcaps proportions are fine.
- I would drop the "l" from the name!
- Stuff leaning one way one day and another way another day? That means it's pretty much balanced.  :-)

Micro stuff:
- The first point in macro above notwithstanding, I agree with the general opinion that the "A" is a bit much; same with the "U".
- The "G" is charming, but perhaps a bit out of character.
- The descender of the "J" is out of character (more below).
- As I said about the "Q", give it some oomph!
- The "f" could be a bit braver; if you loosen the spacing you'll have more room for that. In any case do lengthen the rightward foot serif.
- The gap at the bottom of the "g" is apologetic; I'd make it larger.
- The descender of the "j" is out of character (more below).
- As with the "f", I'd push the rightward foot serif out, perhaps a good deal.
- I agree that the "s" (and "S") have recoiling heads, but somehow I like it!
- The new "t" is great.
- The "w" is very nice.
- I don't get all the hubbub about the "x" - I think for text it's dandy.
- The path you've taken with the "y" is pretty much exactly what happened to me with Patria! The new one is much better, although I think you have room to make the terminal a little bit more aggressive. And you can use that terminal in the UC "J", and possibly in the lc "j" as well.
- In the lining numerals, the zero is way too square, and the bowl of the "6" is too large.
- In the OS numerals, the "3" is totally wonky, and the "6" again too portly. And most of all, you'll need to pull the zero away from the lc "o"; this is a classic conundrum, with various possible solutions: a totally circular ring-like form (yuk), flipped stroke contrast (thick horizontals and thin verticals - seems strange but make sense and can look great) or all the weight on either the left or the right stroke (classy, and can work out great).
- The "8": I personally like them with staggered joins.
- Some other stuff: the "@" is a bit light, and I'd make the inside "a" upright; the curly braces need more contrast; the eszet is too closed at the bottom; I love seeing an "Ae" and "Oe" (I had that idea years ago, then found out that Gary Munch had it way before me, and probably others before him as well) but the bottom of the join of the "Ae" is malformed; also, the joins in the "OE" are too dark.

In terms of selling this: I think you can. But the scene <em>is</em> pretty crowded, so you might try the freemium marketing model: give away the roman, and charge for all the other styles.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, thank you for so much detail. 
I'll have a play with the G J and j. It won't be straightforward transposing the new y's terminal onto those Js due to the angle of the y. I can't quite see how it might work yet.

I've had a go at N, A and G. Here you can see the old and new versions of N and G (old are the first N and G). 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NAGGING_4714.jpg]

The G had rather too vertical contrast so that's corrected, the crossbar is a tad lower, the curve comes up rather than flattening out. The N had its left foot serif strengthened so that the head serif could be more sure of itself. There is a slight curve in the diagonal stroke of the A and N. I brought the right foot of A in and the right foot of M out. The traps on M and N are slightly wider. Think the M and N could do with slightly heavier strokes.

Well there's a lot of other recommendations to look back through and try out, it will take some time :) </div>

I like the new lifting of the curve at the bottom of G very much. I think you could pull the curve out at the letter's lower left side: it looks a bit like it's going to fall leftwards onto its back. (Review C on that, too.) Maybe just lower the extrema points on the left side?

		<div class="commentbody">I aggree your new G is pretty and very personal. Really nice, a delicacy.

"Eterna" certainly sounds much stronger than "Eternal" to my ears.

About my previous comment, let me explain my perception. Below is an Adobe Minion numeral 8 low story deconstucted; I placed a jpg of your 8 in the background. Obviously both are quite different, but nevetheless they are worth to show my subjective point of view.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8_6737.png]
I perceive that, in comparison, the right side stroke of your 8 is a bit light (stenosis) where the pen changes its right-down direction (and before, from the center of the figure) to the left-down; by the other side, immediatly after going left-up in the left side, it is too heavy (edema), the same way as when it reaches the crossing ponint.
It is more noticeable when tested against Palatino's 8:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/palatin_3551.png]
Even when the descending "spine" –I assume, by the closing offset, it is built like a sort of extended S– is similar for both fonts, once you reach the bottom, the stroke suddenly gets too much weight, something that doesn't happen in the top story, where weights are balanced almost the same way.
Besides, you can notice the way Zapf solved the visual trend of leaning to the left: it seems like the 8 is slightly "slanted" to the right.
Probably those are subtle questions that involve my impoverished vision and stereotyped education, so I only hope I had clarified what I wanted to say –wrong or right– before.
Cheers,

Thanks Hrant, useful. I don't think I can follow your j as I've juse removed that kind of terminal from y. Still, the J might work.

		<div class="commentbody">Between the 2nd and 4th "j"s, although of itself I like the 2nd better (with a stronger terminal however), the 4th seems more in character with the rest of the font. However you might find that to both amplify/differentiate the character of the "j" and reduce descender touching issues, the 3rd might actually win - you won't know until you nail down your spacing 90%. At least that's what happened to me with Patria.

As quirky as I like it! :-)
Though for me is optimal as is, I'm not sure about the orthodoxy of the long tail (after all, I asked for heterodoxy). I would try with a y alike serif as an option.
BTW, the new y works finely in context, as well.
The i and the k are impressive.

Your old style turned-stress zero is a clever solution, too. I wonder why it happens the strange effect –pointed by Hrant– that makes my short term memory feels this 00 are two different figures. Funny.

I bet on the fourth j ;-)

		<div class="commentbody">OK, so here's a sneak preview of the italic and black versions. They're far from finished but hopefully will give some ideas about solving problems across the different weights. E.g. the stress seems to need to be less angled in the black weight, and the stroke modulation may or may not be possible with the current conception of the black. 

The lower terminals of the italic descenders were the basis of the original j that Hrant thought didn't fit.

The new top of the regular t has been included in the italic and black too.

The black letters on the glyph list have been tweaked; the grey ones remain the same as on the previous pdf. 

You see in the word 'Quetzalcoatl' that the roman and italic seem to fit quite nicely together?

I widened the B, changed the stem of D, strengthened the terminals on E and F, corrected the stress on P and R, re-did the upper right serif on T, straightened U's verticals. I added a slight curve to the ending of the curly toes on hijklmntu. I put in an alpha. 

v and y are looking slightly wide.

Please comment on the italic lc.

Nina, do you think the eszetts work better now? And what about the AE?? :S

Still not finished playing with the spacing and still have those grey glyphs to finish before posting a block of text with variable tracking for crit, haven't forgotten that!

Looks like all my diacritics have fallen out of place with the sidebearing changes: quite easy to fix though.

Perhaps seeing the interaction of the different weights will help us decide if this is an Eternal or an Eterna.

Some really quick impressions (add more salt than usual because I'm only just having my morning coffee):

I still think the left diagonals of "V" and "Y" are optically slanting out a tiny hair, much like the "A" was before. Looking at "Shadow" on page 2, the same may be true for the lc "w"?

The (italic?) ampersand might have a stronger pen influence than your alphabetic glyphs; especially the top, and the top-right terminal, may seem a hair too "calligraphic".

Re the cap eszett, I would try thinning the top. Check out <a href="http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=244">this masthead</a> of a German newspaper (although I think the bottom-right terminal of your cap eszett, as well as its overall shape and proportions, works perfectly, and possibly better than the linked image). I believe there are a couple of PDFs regarding cap eszett design linked to on that page, but I can't seem to find them right now (sorry!).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My few impressions:

Black weight is fun and coming along nicely. Black italic 'a', with its fat bowl hanging under a raised counter, looks a little cartoony and out-of-character for the face. Black 't', both italic and roman, also looks fat and kind of sloppy relative to the other black letters; maybe that bulging diagonal on the NW is too pneumatic. Black 'B' could be widened to take some pressure off those narrow counters. The thins on black 'N' aren't working - I think maybe they're just too thin. (Compare to the 'U' just before them in BUNNY.)

Italic is also coming along nicely. (Really, this whole project is!) Italic 'z' is beautiful. Since the roman has some "flowiness" to it (with the curling toes of hmn etc.), perhaps you should allow yourself some more cursive features in the italic. The lead-in serif of italic letters like mnru etc. might be more curly as a counterpart to the toes, for example. You could do a 'p' with an intersection instead of a serif at the top. You could do something more interesting with the italic 'y'. I'd like to see italic 'k''s arm experimented with - maybe something that curves away from the main stroke of the letter instead of towards it?

I do hope you'll include a connected-crossbar 'A' alternate.

All of your sevens look like the bottom terminal is way left of what I'd expect relative to the top horizontal, but that may be a stylistic decision rather than a mistake.

Maybe make the crossing over of strokes on your alpha more apparent, to distinguish it from an italic 'a'?

Hope that helps!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks guys; I'll have a look at the Eszett and maybe bring the top right back down and a little beaky corner. About the italic ampersand you are right, it does look a little too soft and roundy for the other characters.
The regular vwxy have been really trick in this font as I wanted the initial curve, followed by the almost-straight diagonal, a sharp curve at the apex and a flaring to the tops. I haven't quite got there with the UC and perhaps the lc w needs a bit more tinkering.
The black is just an initial concept, not fully clear yet and very unpolished. I agree about the a looking cartoony. I think it's more to do with the curvy stem as the bowl could be ok if the counter were a tiny bit lower. The t looks like someone sat on it. I think it needs to be much taller and more elegant. Yes! B can be wider. I didn't think of that as I wanted to keep the curves tight and the general shapes quite condensed. I'll try wider! Black S looks a bit light too, not sure how to make it darker without the terminals crashing into the spine. N needs a better solution.
Italic. I really enjoyed making the shapes. The lead-in serifs could stand being longer, perhaps curlier but I don't want it to end up looking cute or twiddly. I'm not happy with k or y, so it's interesting you recommend changing their structure. I'll post some alternatives. An intersection on the p...like Baskerville italic you mean?
You convinced me about the connected-crossbar alternates. Will do ABR. 
On the roman, I don't like the current tail of the j and am having another go. This shows the evolution of j:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/j_5569.jpg]
The last one strikes me as a nice fit for the other glyphs, though I might have to smooth the inner corner slightly more.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jelly_3595.jpg]
Nina, do the tittles look right? :>
Wondering about if the 3 needs a foot serif too. Not sure where I'm going with the OS numerals as I quite wanted the dangly 3 and 5 but the intention was 'dynamic' not 'totally wonky' ;)
I think the sevens look like that because they're quite narrow. I like them so far but they might become uncomfortable for long periods.</div>

I was mostly talking about contrast in both cases. Re the cap eszett: I actually think this is one of the best I've seen,* shape-wise. I wouldn't necessarily change the concept; it's mostly that the weight of the upper horizontal stroke seems off (I'd try to move the inner contour up on the horizontal segment). Maybe if you fix that it'll work just great.
* Although of course nobody knows yet what a good one looks like. But this looks good, and looks like it would read just fine as that letter nobody really knows yet. :->

<em>Nina, do the tittles look right? :></em>
No – left! :-D
I feel a bit uncomfortable in the role of Tittle Expert… Perhaps not surprisingly, I'd make them bigger. :-) Placement looks better, but to my eyes they still look slightly left. Those tittles seem to be quite a subjective thing though, so maybe you don't have to do them my way. ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't agree with Hrant's philosophy in the most recent post above. Getting the weights right is one of the most important things to a highly readable face. This means achieving evenness of color, but achieving it often involves variation in shapes and sizes, adapting to the letter shape and its relation to other letters. 

Matthew Carter's recently released [[http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Rocky|Rocky]] to me is like a master class on this issue: getting evenness of color and liveliness at the same time. That's a key challenge for a great typeface. On the lower case of Rocky, compare the terminals on the acfrsjy. Awesome.  </div>

Evidence? You don't set a book in a monoline.

It's divergence that's really at play - one simply has
to have the right amount, not too much. Even color
is a backwards illusion, a conscious caprice.

And Rocky, tellingly, seems to be a display face:
"In publications, they provide a sharp spot of
typographic 'color' as signature headletter
series for Roger Black’s redesign of the Rocky
Mountain News."

That's a straw man. I said even color within the variety of forms. 

I think variety in weight has to be restrained for the sake of even color. Imagine a face that has half bold and half regular: not very readable. If you want high readability, I think evenness of color needs to be one pole of the design problem, along with variety and others.

Rocky is a display face, and a very readable one. It would be too sharp and contrasty in text, I suspect.

		<div class="commentbody">Display faces -like Rocky- don't need to be readable; although they do need to be <em>legible</em>, that's a trivial challenge. What they really need to be is aesthetically attractive - which usually means pretty. And superficial formal harmony (things like descenders that are equally weighty) is a long-standing benchmark of prettiness. But that can change (which means it will). Anyway, such harmony becomes a necessary evil of sorts when it comes to readability; it delivers nothing useful, functionally.

The lower you go under the radar of reader consciousness (immersive reading) the more you can drift away from this shallow modernist harmony, and move towards a much deeper, fruitful harmony. Ergo: a text font should have tittles that are a bit too big, descenders of different shape/weight, etc.

> evenness of color needs to be one pole of the design problem

What I was trying to say is that evenness of color is not really a pole at all in the readability realm. I believe it's an absence of divergence; it is divergence that needs to be controlled, and evenness is a byproduct of pulling back divergence by a certain amount.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, Hrant and I have had this debate before, and I don't want to belabor it. 

I learned about the importance of even color particularly from Doyald Young's book Fonts & Logos. And I came to the conclusion that uneven color is 'noise' that distracts from detection of letter features, so it is important to readability. Thus it should be one of they key guidelines in type design. All the most widely used text types have very even color--and, I believe, in every script.  

Rocky is a headline and titling face and as such readability is important. For other uses readability may be lesser priority for display type, but I think for this usage it is important. </div>

When I suggested bringing the y more in line with the j, I was thinking that the black blob on its tail was too distracting. I don't intend to make the shapes the same and not even necessarily the weight the same, as I think there can be a good tension between contrasting elements. For me at the moment the y's tail makes the y a bit bottom-heavy on its own and distracting among other letters as the blob is below the baseline.

Hrant said >Totally even color isn’t an ideal, it’s a disease. Evidence? You don’t set a book in a monoline.

I think overall colour of text can (should?) look even, even in a font where the individual shapes are contrasty. I don't want to see books set in patchy text either. The best way it seems to me is a nice balance between where the contrast between and within shapes creates visual melody but the unity of the font assures readability (or do I mean legibility?) That goes back to Nina's point about the soft/hard elements of the particular shapes I'm using. I want distinctive but not distracting.

>Yes, you do have to control the “patchiness”. But to me even color is a byproduct and not something to directly strive for, because it doesn’t give you anything except prettiness, which is largely moot in text setting.

I agree, and I wasn't striving for the y and j to match, just look like they can talk to each other :)

Rocky seems to achieve even colour, although the weights of serifs are different. Hopefully I can achieve something like that in my (text and possibly display) font if I'm clever!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Right. Please tell me what you think is best to do with this r.alt. I developed the outy ear first but then made the vertical one to fit better. Currently I have an Opentype calt substituting the outy eared r whenever it comes before an a, c, d, e, o, q, eth and space.
I am concerned this might give weird results in words with both varieties. Or perhaps not. I've seen other fonts where double letters are substituted through calt with slightly varied shapes to reduce 'visual stutter'. (E.g. an ff lig usually has a wider second f and an ll lig can have a taller second l.)
Is the difference distracting or enriching?
Should I choose just one r or leave as it is? Or something else?

		<div class="commentbody">That looks like a nicely sophisticated solution, with the variety doing nothing but helping (for a text face). I might suggest an innie beak (better than "ear" btw) as an alternate companion for the outie, but that might be a bit pushy in "rr" pairs.

Can we see the "rn" for both variants (and maybe for an innie too)?

> Your vertical one looks a little narrower

But that is part of the solution.
BTW, you might vary the rightward foot serif length based on the variant.

One other thing: when/if you make a very dark weight you might discover than the outie no longer works (because the darker the weight the tighter the spacing).

> rhythm

No such thing in a text face.

Or rather: in a text face rhythm is not so superficial.
It might even be invisible - or better put, subvisible.

Totally.
In a display face you either do no variation or dramatic variation. The subtle variation that can be fruitful in a text face usually looks like a "mistake" during conscious observation.

> Wouldn’t it look like it swallowed its tongue?

:-)
What is this, a zoo?

Dunno, I like it. And it lets you get quite close to the rounds in dark weights without neutering the "r" (which needs all the help it can get).

The cap eszet: I prefer the first one, but I'd keep working on making it more integral, instead of an obvious fusion of two shapes.

		<div class="commentbody">Hm, re the cap eszett, I'll have to agree the second one seems a bit weak-topped. Though I still think the first version with a heavy vertical *and* a rather heavy horizontal, with a slim "corner", looks odd weight-wise. :-/

I like your "r"s, though I'll second the call for an "innie". Actually the r/o combination Hrant posted is probably my favorite detail about Patria. Putting an "r" like that next to a round shape and watching it click is a pretty amazing experience.

Oh, regarding your most recent sample, I think the eth looks pretty well balanced (although I'm not sure if people wouldn't expect the bowl to fully reach the x-line). 
On the other hand (also not what you asked about) the horizontal placement of the accents seems a bit off - I'd expect the accent on an iacute to "start off" roughly where a tittle would, if that makes any sense; it seems shifted to the left, as does the one on the aacute. My Icelandic is rather poor though so I'm probably not the best person to ask about this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah, that's nice. It's a good shape in itself, though to me, it still looks weak next to the other shapes with serifs up there at the caps line. It's a tough shape and I've tried 12 different versions already, with reversed contrast and all sorts of different structures! It's got the same problem as the ezh shape, in that the contrast has to go somewhere but it's either ending up looking badly formed or wrongly stressed. :< You're right in saying the heavy vertical combined with the heavy horizontal looks funny, that is not a common pattern. I kinda thought it worked ok.

I haven't seen an attractive innie r. They always look unhappy and a bit mean and droopy to me. However, I will try one out. I'm beginning to see Hrant's point about only having the outy though. 

Craig, do you mean the shape of the accents is too sharp and needs rounding somehow? And re the ae, I think it's best for it not to be symmetrical. The shapes are simply repeated versions of the a and e fused together. Is that the wrong approach? I don't know.

Nina, the accents are still a bit arbitrary; I don't know an awful lot about placement though I did find an interesting diacritics pdf that I should perhaps read more thoroughly. It seems the acute and grave should have only 30% of their weight across the optical centre of the base glyph.

Yes. Did you try rounding the thick ends? Or maybe even just changing one or more of the angles so that it's not so nearly symmetrical down its axis. They just seem very mechanical to me. You might also consider making the size and/or angle of the acute/grave accents that go on caps different than those on the lowercase.</div>

Rounding the top corners of accents may be a handy solution (that resembles the caligraphic shape), though for my long term Spanish reading habits it would be more suitable changing the angles to reinforce the stress, I mean: 
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/accents_4303.png]
About the placing of the center, I think that image is useful also.

Accents in UC admit several solutions (actually, it was a rule, until not much time ago, that because of unavailability of space and types, UC weren't accented in non optical compositions):
<ul>
<li>The easy way is to rise the accent uppon the character (as shown), but the lack of space implies it need to be closer.</li>
<li>An alternate way is to use UC accents, specifically designed for this.</li>
<li>Eventually, one can replace the UC components with small caps.</li>
<li>Otherwise, one can use common accents for lc and UC, but design shorter custom UC components that fit better.</li>

		<div class="commentbody">The best thing on spacing is still Tracy's Letters of Credit. [[http://briem.ismennt.is/|Briem's web site]] has a good summary--but don't take the 'equal area' thing too seriously. 

You need to space and kern with many letters present--to avoid over kerning--and it is easiest to judge in words.

My experience has been that it took me quite some (painful) time to learn to judge this properly and quickly, and still there are often questions of compromise between competing considerations. But it is critically important. As I think David Berlow said on Typophile, aside from your drawing of the characters, it is the main contributor to the look of your typeface. 

A good test for even color, mentioned in Printer's Type in the 20th Century, is to do a test file with 

abacadaeafagahaiajakalamanaoapaqarasatauavawaxaxaz
babbbbcb....

And so on with all lc, uc, numbers. etc. and then print it out small--12 pt or less. The dark spots will then jump out more to the eye. You can also look at spacing this way, but this test is more critical for seeing if some strokes are too heavy or light. And you can print out a file with one of the classic text fonts that you most admire, and compare its evenness to yours.

Hmmm, seems like you have a lot of work ahead
of you making all the other letters less gray.  :->

BTW, see my third post of Feb 22 here:
http://typophile.com/node/54942

Four tactics of good spacing development:
- Control strings.
- High-frequency letter pairs (and hopefully triplets, etc.)
- High-frequency whole words.
- Rare but problematic words (like wyvern). Hard to compile.

Oh, and one over-riding principle: Remember, there's
always room for improvement... so eventually stop trying!

On the latest attachment you can see the old j and y (which I really don't prefer at all). I should make a pdf with the other versions for comparison really. I rather like the r with the outpoking beak. But I also like the cleverness that Opentype allows with Calt to make it vary depending on neighbouring glyphs.

I have bumped up the spacing and the sample is at 10pt, ligs switched off until I work out the correct spacing needed and iron out the gaps and squashes between letters. Spacing doesn't come naturally to me. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is coming along really nicely. Great to see this in text &ndash; I really enjoy reading it. 

For the "j" and the "y", the new forms are most likely an improvement. While I like the old glyphs seen in isolation, their terminals might be too stiff/determined in the overall context of your font; the new ones flow more nicely. Except the old ones matched the "f" very nicely, which might now feel a little lonely? Dunno.
That said, I'm not sure the new "j" terminal couldn't benefit from a little more strength/definition; it seems a bit weak (and/or light), especially compared to the "y", which seems to work quite nicely. 
The whole "j" might also be leaning left a bit? But maybe it's just the tittle.

Regarding the "a", I'd prefer the top version. The bottom one looks a hair narrow to me, and I think the top one has more character &ndash; it's a likeable and beautiful glyph.

Btw, a couple of other things that struck me: 
The "x" confuses me a bit (didn't notice this before) – the top-right seems strangely bent. That also makes it look vaguely Hebrew to me (which I don't read, so here's lots of salt).
The "z" looks like its bottom is sloping upwards. Might that serif need more definition?
And, I love the way your "ft" combination clicks together!

Spacing-wise, one thing that jumped out at me in the "new" version is that "ll" seems quite tight. (Although &ndash; either I'm having printer or eye issues, or &ndash; is that a ligature / contextual alternate? In the bottom part, wherever there's a double "l", the first one looks… shorter.)</div>

In my printout, at size, I also think:
- the serif on the right end of 'w' looks too wide
- the last vertical of 'm' might be too serpentine
- 'g''s bottom bowl looks a little like it's been mashed in from the bottom right - my eye wants it to be a little rounder and a little wider towards the right on that SE corner.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Probably a discretionary lig I forgot to switch off...yes it would be tight as that was made prior to the space increases. Well spotted!

Thanks for enjoying reading it! I find the shapes interesting too. 

The z does flare towards the curving tail, in an upwards way. The cap E and L do similar things. But on the z, combined with the diagonal heavy stroke, it perhaps makes the whole shape look tilted anticlockwise. It never wanted a proper serif on the end there, and seems to have the personality of a cat. (Sorry Hrant, another zoo analogy)

I wonder if the f and r can be friends to stop the f being lonely. Maybe the f's hood can go out a bit more like the outpoking r beak, be a bit heavier...will try also a different terminal there perhaps.

You are right about the j, it looks a bit ailing. I'll crank up the foot and see about its leftward lean.

I can't seem to get a definite plan for the x!

Glad you like ft; wish I could get fl and fi to look more polished.

Hm well the new a does look kind of narrow and I've realised the old bowl looks nicer too. But I think perhaps the top serif of the old one could be more interesting.

Thanks,</div>

I was just looking at this webpage (which I appreciate very much) with a guy who never heard what it means designing typefaces. We were both looking a this beautiful typeface while I tried to explain him some things around the story of typefaces.
I just wanted to say that I am (although it may seem strange) very very proud of you all out there doing these wonderful things and discussing about, and one can feel all the heart that you lay in there.

GO ON DOING SO!!!

By the way,
as I do like your x very much, it has made me think.
Is it an absolute law that the left thin stroke ends up higher than the right stroke is beginning (in the center of the letter)
or are there faces where it is made in an opposite sense?
(I did once)

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Stefan, I think no it's not a law, there don't seem to be laws in type design.

The thin stroke here is disjointed only to make it optically unbroken. You can see what I mean on page six of [[http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_6.pdf|this document]]. You'll see also that the example x there has the thin left stroke ending below the start of the thin right stroke, so it depends on the weight of the glyph and the angle of the arms to some extent too.

so there is kind of law anyhow ;-)
And as I said I like your x very much.

Yet, I found (lucky me so I am no totally wrong doing so for myself ;-)
exmples for the other solution with the left stroke ending below the start of the right one.
Yet your solution ist more natural because it makes the optical space below bigger than the one above
as anyone would prefer.
And by the way one example ist Weiss Italic. (the other is Perpetua) 
And a man who did design a ‘s’ that seems turned around (which I like anyway very much;-) may also make an ‘x’ turned upside down ;-))

I have decided to keep MY x as it was. ;-)

Go on wiht your very very good face!
