  body: I can&#39;t believe it! I haven&#39;t read all the posts... but it&#39;s just
    too much! I feel sorry for Vince. Although I&#39;m not a fan of Comic Sans I must
    say, he had a reason to design Comic Sans and that was his job! Stop getting the
    designer involved in this... he isn&#39;t Comic Sans! It wasn&#39;t his fault!
    I&#39;d like to also add that I went to the same grad school &#40;University of
    Reading, UK&#41; as Vince to do typeface design, so I do have some respect for
    his work &#40;I don&#39;t know him personally though&#41;. <BR> <BR>I think there&#39;s
    much to be said about informal fonts. People just love Comic Sans. Most of my
    non-designer friends love it and use it for their PowerPoint presentations and
    emails. I don&#39;t blame them. They need typefaces that they think are useful
    for expressing themselves and that are freely available to them. With the popularization
    of computers &#40;or maybe even the typewriter&#41;, all the friendliness and
    warmth associated with handwriting are gone. We began to have to &#39;typeset&#39;
    personal letters and other informal things with official, cold looking typefaces.
    Do you expect them to use Times New Roman or other &#39;proper typefaces&#39;
    for everything? I don&#39;t think they should somehow. They are not as educated
    in type as us graphic designers, and they simply choose what appeals to them.
    The criteria that they use when they choose typefaces are different... they tend
    to choose non-typographic and &#39;handwritten&#39; type. There&#39;s nothing
    wrong with it, I think. But the popularity of Comic Sans just show how big an
    effect a software monopoly can have on the visual landscape. I think we urgently
    need a good workhorse informal font that is free for everyone to use. I&#39;m
    quite happy to take that on myself. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t agree with deleting Comic
    Sans on art schools&#39; computers.... that&#39;s censorship! People, even designers,
    have to right to know what&#39;s available and to make decisions for themselves.
    Instructors who are fed up with seeing Comic Sans in their students&#39; work
    should blame it on themselves, not the fact that the font is available on the
    computers. Education is key. I agree with Vince that Comic Sans could look really
    good if it is used well. I&#39;m proud to say that I&#39;ve used Sand in an email
    I sent on Halloween day! It worked! :-&#41; I must say I&#39;d rather see Comic
    Sans than Sand for running text. And trust me, I&#39;ve seen Sand being used for
    running text! <BR> <BR>K.

  body: The bitterness in this thread strikes me as typographic snobbery, with at
    least a touch of envy at the sensational popularity of this dumbed-down typeface.
    If it was that bad it wouldn&#39;t be so ubiquitous. The fact is it&#39;s the
    immediate choice of many people. It&#39;s a superstar - a stupendous design success
    and Vincent should be immensely proud.  <BR> <BR>May your blood forever boil.

    to tell you precisely why I hate it; I just do. I woke up one morning and had

    out some scripts. When I came across them the other day, it was like looking in
    the mirror and suddenly remembering what exactly you did the drunken night before,
    running into a one night stand or realizing that you&#39;re living on skid row,
    prostituting yourself for crack. I thought I was being cute. Now I want to cleanse

  body: Wanting your favorite typeface to become part of the standard would be a wish
    granted by the Monkey&#39;s Paw. It would then join the ranks of dearly-beloved
    typefaces like Times, Helvetica, Avant Garde, Zaph Chancery and Comic Sans. <BR>
    <BR>Would you still like your favorite font the one-thousanth time you saw it
    on a lost-dog flyer? How many times would you like to see it used as a newsletter
    text face in artificial bold with too-tight leading? How often would you like
    to see it on a laser-printed price list with lots of sizes and underlines and
    outlines and drop shadows? How often would it take for you to see your favorite
    display face used for e-mail text or body copy &#40;in all caps, of course&#41;?
    How often would you enjoy seeing it artificially bolded or slanted? How often
    would you need to see it used for a 3-D spinning logo? <BR> <BR>Would you even
    want to touch it for serious projects any more? <BR> <BR>The people who wold commit
    these attrocities simply would never buy your favorite typeface, except by sheer
    accident, and they would never, ever buy fonts with expert sets. <BR> <BR>My greatest,
    secret fear is that a blackletter typeface will someday become standard - you
    know everyone would be using it in all caps whenever they wanted to be sophisticated
    or elegant. The fact that we don&#39;t have this now actually reflects good taste
    on somebody&#39;s part, because the masses would love it. Give me Comic Sans any
    day!
