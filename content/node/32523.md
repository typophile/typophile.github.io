  of 1966 typography studies from students in Basel. Always amazing.\r\n\r\nA friend
  emailed some PNGs of a face she's working on--very fresh and multi-dimensional.
  So I'm sitting here at the kitchen table with a large \"A\" on my laptop and in
  the distance, in my field of vision is Tom Geismar's \"Z\" poster.\r\n\r\nSo I'm
  wondering, what is it about letterforms, that psychological something, that's so
  evocative?"

    times, coarse at times, crude, eloquent well-proportioned and gangly... really
    amazing.\r\ni think sometimes though, it's the incredible promise they hold. with
    letterforms, we can say anything. we can be shakespeare or tupac or basho or springsteen. "

  body: "of course -- the nature. well observed. the letterforms are, certainly evocative
    of nature (we are always given as example the evolution of the letter \"a\" from
    the canaanite pictograph). but i think i'm in love with the abstractions they've
    become. \r\n\r\ninteresting topic, michele."

  body: i was thinking of eric gill, who said, "letters are things, not pictures of
    things." but then he folded a paper printer's hat, put it on his head, and ran
    from the room.
