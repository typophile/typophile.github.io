  \"clan\"</a> now is that FontFont just released the large FF Clan family by my good

  FontFont, and hopefully not \u0141ukasz's last. \r\n\r\nOverview of the FontShop
  release 39:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.de/news/NewFontFonts/Overview%20FF39.pdf\r\n\r\nFF

    by super families.\r\nThe FF Turkish text sample is quite funny, its meaning makes
