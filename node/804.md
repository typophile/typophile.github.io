  body: David, <BR> <BR>thanks for your suggestions, but - like Yves &#40;I&#39;m
    relieved to say&#41; - I can&#39;t seem to find viewable samples of the fonts
    you mentioned anywhere. <BR> <BR>The logo was taken from the <a href="http://www.boesendorfer.com">B

  body: Hadj, <BR> <BR>ok. now it is more clear.  <BR> we are talking about 1882.
    <BR> <BR> And we are talking about Germany. the Gothics - and not the Roman typefaces
    - of various-various kinds remained  the everyday types for nearly Five centuries.  <BR>
    <BR> <BR>maybe it&#39;s a custom logo. maybe. <BR> <BR>anyway-  <BR> <BR>if you
    are in Germany look for Julius Hoffmann and  Klingspor type foundry  <BR> <BR>
