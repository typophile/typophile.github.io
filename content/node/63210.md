  body: "This is a very badly distorted use of AI envelope/warp tools. Back in the
    day, lettering artists were much more skillful at doing this sort of thing using
    their hand eye skills and experience. There are still plenty of old guys around
    who can do this beautifully the old way and plenty of young guys around who can
    do a much, much better job using todays bezier tools.  What a shame this pathetic
    piece of s\xDFit gets high visibility and the very talented lettering artists
    of our time end up doing obscure work.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Even if it isn't a font, perhaps it is possible to suggest a font which the
    lettering resembles (and could even have been inspired by) - a bold square gothic
    with small round corners.
