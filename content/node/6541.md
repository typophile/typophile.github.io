body: Hi there, <BR>I&#39;ve recently become a member of this wonderful place so therefore
  I&#39;ve got a little project that needs some attention. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a logo
  for my own company YESYES. My main area is naming/corporate ID for newly started
  companies and Art Direction in general. <BR> <BR>I wanted a plain and stylish logotype
  and also including symbol in order to make it flexible. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been through
  a dozen designs... and this is what I ended up with. <BR> <BR>Comments are more
  than welcome! <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>/Henriko<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4828.gif"

  body: Henrik, <BR> <BR>i really like it, very simple, very clear. <BR> <BR>My onlu
    comment is that you should compensate the &#34;Y&#34;s, make them a little more
    wider and, and make the diagonals thiner, they look to thick to me if you compare
    them with the horizontals of the &#34;E&#34;s. <BR> <BR>BTW, I love the color

  body: Hey Gonzales, <BR> <BR>You really got a point there with the thickness! <BR>I&#39;ll
    fix that! <BR> <BR>Originally the font has a different angle according to my symbol
    so I had to alter the angle of the &#34;Y&#34; so they would fit together &#40;have
    the same angle&#41; <BR> <BR>Therefore I&#39;m a bit concerned about expanding
    the width of the &#34;Y&#34; - it could end up looking more like a &#34;V&#34;
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for the critique anyway <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'Just the spacing: <BR>1&#41; A little bit tighter on the right of the first
    &#34;Y&#34;, and the right of the first &#34;S&#34;. <BR>2&#41; A lot tighter
    on the right of the second &#34;Y&#34;. <BR> <BR>I think that triangle logo works
    well. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Could there perhaps be something you could add in the way of
    character, to the letters to make them a little more unique?

  body: The negative space on the graphic element looks like a bikini bottom. And
    when you see it that way, the shape has hips and legs as well. Sorry.

  body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>Thanks for all the construtive words...  <BR>I&#39;ve merely
    corrected all the &#34;loose&#34; ends and other modifications... <BR> <BR>But
    still I could really do with some ideas in order to make the characters look a
    bit more unique... <BR> <BR>Anyone ?? <BR> <BR>As always thank you in advance

  body: I wonder what it would look like if the Y was drawn with curved strokes rather
    than straight ones. See <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/">here</a>
    for an example in serif form.

    first to spot that <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s like the old Bank of America logo where
    some people saw a birdshape and others didn&#39;t! <BR> <BR>Still the ones who
    saw the bird, never saw the logo differently!  <BR> <BR>&#34;That damn bird just
    wouldn&#39;t fly away&#34;  <BR>hehe... <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>/Henriko'

  body: Jared &#62;&#62; <BR> <BR>Interesting idea... but I must admit that I&#39;m
    a rookie at geometrical shapes... I really don&#39;t know how to make such curved
    strokes by perfection... I work as an Art Director so I&#39;m more used to sketch
    up ideas and plain composition <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> - Can I get some guidelines here ?? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>/Henriko
