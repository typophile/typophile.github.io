body: I&#39;m looking for a very old industrial looking gothic font. <BR> <BR>It looks
  a bit like Trade Gothic or DIN, only more blocky with diagnol edges - almost like
  stencil letters except there are no gaps in the individual letters. <BR> <BR>If
  you guys could throw some names out there I would be delighted!

  body: That&#39;s in the ballpark. The font I&#39;ve seen is more condensed and a
    little more subtle.
