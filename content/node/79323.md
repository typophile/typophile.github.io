body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've created the new .enc file which covers Latin, Greek, and
  Cyrillic and others.\r\nI have three questions about the file and how Fontlab behaves
  when generating a glyph.\r\n\r\n1. I have smallcaps with the suffix .sc but the
  Fontlab does not assign Unicodes when I generate them.\r\nIs there any way to manually
  assign Unicode values beforehand?\r\n\r\n2. When I generate Cyrillic A with the
  default encoding tables, Fontlab automatically pastes Latin A to them (which is
  good for me). However, it doesn't work for my encoding file. Does anybody know how
  to make it work?\r\n\r\n3. Similar to Q2. When I generate fi ligature or aacute
  for example, it automatically puts correspondent components. However, it pastes
  decomposed Latin A when I generate Greek A (I want it as a component). Again, could
  you tell me how it works and how to change it?\r\n\r\nThank you."

    are no unicode values for stuff like small caps. That\u2019s why we process them
    with suffixes and Opentype Scripts. But yes, you can encode unicode points and
    names in the encoding file. Read the manual or look at the included encoding files.\r\n\r\n<cite>However,
    it doesn't work for my encoding file. Does anybody know how to make it work?</cite>\r\n\r\nYou
    probably need to make sure that your encoding file is using the same names Fontlab
    is checking for in aliases.dat. Or edit aliases.dat. Again, read the manual (or
    just look at the file, the syntax is fairly obvious)."

    know that there are Unicode values for smallcaps (some are IPA smallcaps, and
    the others are in Latin extended ranges).\r\nIs it unusual to assign phonetic
    smallcap unicodes?\r\n\r\n<cite>Or edit aliases.dat.</cite>\r\nThat file is the
    one I was looking for! Thank you very much for the help."

  body: "IPA small cap glyphs are used in a specific linguistic context and thus earned
    their Unicode slots. Ordinary typographic small caps are considered stylistic
    variants and therefore not granted separate Unicode positions. IPA small caps
    are also likely to be designed differently than the normal variety, as they are
    meant to harmonize among lowercase letters rather than as whole words or sentences
    on their own.\r\n\r\nAdobe used to assign small caps to a portion of the Public
    Use Area, but that practice has been deprecated."
