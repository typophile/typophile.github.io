    I point out that in my not-so-humble opinion this sample bears more resemblance
    to a formal script than to an italic (for example the typical x-shape). :^P\r\n\r\nI
    could be wrong, but until this gets identified and confirmed, I stand by my description.\r\n\r\nTsss,

    had a look at Dwiggins\u2019 Eldorado which Dan mentioned, or rather the homonymous
    revival by Berlow, Frere-Jones & Rickner. Yes, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/font_bureau/eldorado_text_italic/?sample_text=abcefgvwxy&sample_size=60&acs_p=1&acs_pt=24&acs=1\">its
    italic is quite different</a>, but at least the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/eldorado_text_italic_sc/?sample_text=abcefgvwxy%20X&sample_size=60\">italic
    (small) cap x has a cross-bar</a>, too."

    I am showing again caracters of the font that I got in my university. I am researching
    a lot but I don't see some similar font.\r\nFlorian, this font isn't a digital
    font. It's a analogic typeface:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/image_3_metal_6339.JPG]\r\n\r\nDan
    Reynolds, I visited the site http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Eldorado/styles and
    saw the 'similar' font, but it's not equal.\r\n\r\nThank all you. I will consider
    -- formal non-connected script, presumably called El Dorado. I go on researching
    and who found out other informations, I would like to know \r\n\r\n:)"
