  body: Thanks Tiffany and Mike. I love Fluidum. <BR> <BR>I guess I was seeking out
    something more  <BR>in the direction of a Fat Face with ball terminals. <BR> <BR>Pistilli
    Roman is nice, too. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

    Normande Italic</a> might do, but I really do like Stilla.  <BR>What&#39;s wrong
    with it?

  body: It&#39;s not uncommon to see Stilla on book covers when you <BR>browse at
    used bookstores. <BR> <BR>I just figured there would be other digitizations and
    wanted <BR>to be informed. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Wow, I had no idea that Middleton did Stilla. He was  <BR>responsible for
    most of Ludlow&#39;s library. I didn&#39;t know he  <BR>had done anything beyond
    that.

    I think the swash bits are yummilicious.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Ignacio, brilliant stuff you got there; thanks
    for putting it  <BR>up. This face looks like a perfect excuse for an OpenType  <BR>version
    with all those alternate character shapes. Lovely!
