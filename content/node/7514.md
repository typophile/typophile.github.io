  <BR>&#40;PLEASE excuse if this posted twice...not sure if my first one submited&#41;
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure this is going to be impossible...but I&#39;m trying to figure
  out these fonts for a project.  They must be pixel fonts...I just can&#39;t determine
  which ones...I find a few similar but most have the curve-y ends on the t, etc.
  making them different.  If you can help, I&#39;ll be forever in your debt! <BR>
  <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>PS - if you want i can send u links to the sites but it won&#39;t
  be too helpful because they are both flash sites.

  body: Ryan - the trick is to post your answer, and then go back and add the link.
    I learned this the hard way, just like you. <BR> <BR>While we&#39;re on the subject
    of links, would you mind putting newurl before web addresses in your links so
    that they open up in new windows? Beats having to backtrack in the browser.

    how should I link them using newurl?

    add a backslash &#40;\&#41; before it, and it will automatically generate a new-window
    link to www.whatever.com with the text &#34;Whatever!&#34;
