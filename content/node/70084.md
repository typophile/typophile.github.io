body: "May 4, 2010\r\nI'm proud to announce the released of Harfang, my most recent
  typeface family. This second typeface \u2014 ITC Migration Sans was the first one
  \u2014,  was created with the invaluable advice of Xavier Dupr\xE9, Chris Lozos
  and of course Rod Cavazos (PSY/OPS Type Foundry). \r\n \r\nMy goal for Harfang was
  to create a serif typeface that would be easy to read at text sizes, while having
  a strong personality at larger sizes. The initial design had a purely rounded style,
  but with each development pass I introduced some angularity. The final result is
  a typeface that is easy to read in long texts, advertising copy, annual reports
  and the like; but one that also provides a crisp and stylish appeal in more prominent
  display settings. I chose the name Harfang (Harfang des neiges \u2014 Snowy Owl
  or Great White Owl) because after my first typeface, Migration, I wanted something
  with a thematic relation. On a more personal level, Harfang is the avian emblem
  of Qu\xE9bec and recalls the long winters and the breathtaking white landscapes
  of the place I call home, Abitibi.\r\n\r\nFinally, many thanks to my wife Constance
  and my daughter Jade. \u2014Andr\xE9 Simard\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HARFANG_specEN_4173.jpg]\r\n\r\nhttp://www.psyops.com/html/spec_harfang.html

    like to point out, however, that Qu\xE9bec is not a country, no matter how much
    the PQ wants sovereignty. "
