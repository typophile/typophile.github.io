  &#40;from a windows machine with cyrillic fonts&#41; and I should use the texts

  cyrillic fonts. <BR> <BR>I would like to know, if I would buy 2 opentype-fonts,
  then install one on the windows machine and the second on my mac, can I open the
  cyrillic texts without problems and import them into quark or indesign? <BR>I read
  a lot on adobes website, but I would like to have somebody, whe can approve that
  from his experiences. <BR>thanks for your help in advance! <BR>yours sincerely <BR>ferdinand '

    just have to buy one OpenType font and install it on both machines. <BR> <BR>However,
    the regular version of QuarkXPress won&#39;t handle Cyrillic. On the Mac, even
    the Passport version of QXP can&#39;t use the Cyrillic characters in a Unicode
    font. However, importing a Windows Word doc with Cyrillic text into Mac InDesign,
    and setting it in an OpenType font, works just fine. That&#39;s how we did the
    Cyrillic text in our specimen books, as I recall. <BR> <BR>John Hudson did the
    book &#34;Language Culture Type&#34; in InDesign, but presumably on Windows. <BR>
    <BR>Of course, you&#39;re welcome to get somebody who doesn&#39;t work at Adobe
    to confirm this.  <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Greetings Ferdinand, <BR> <BR>For anything multilingual I recommend you abandon
    Quark altogether. To use Cyrillic fonts you need the Passport version, and the
    fonts themselves have to be the old 8-bit versions &#40;Adobe Cyrillic encoding
    or Windows codepage 1250, and I don&#39;t think the modes are interchangeable
    across platforms.&#41; The encoding discrepancies end up being a nightmare. Even
    established type designers have difficulties making their fonts work for these
    non-Latin-1 environments, especially if their main font-building tool is still
    Fontographer. But this nightmare is easily solved by Unicode. If you have a Quark
    license already, I believe Adobe offers a reasonable competetive upgrade to InDesign
    2.0. Try to look at this project of yours as an opportunity to get into InDesign.
    Personally I&#39;ve grown to love the app and wouldn&#39;t use anything else.
    <BR> <BR>I really wish Quark <I>would</I> get on the Unicode bandwagon and adopt
    either OpenType or AAT support. The resulting competition might give Adobe an
    incentive to accelerate and refine their own OT support in their own applications.
    InDesign was at a disadvantage &#40;in terms of its ability to sell OpenType&#41;
    from the beginning since it&#39;s a brand new underdog. Illustrator, on the other
    hand, is arguably the vector-drawing market leader, so its upcoming OT support
    &#40;if any&#41; should prompt more OT font sales and perhaps give users further
    incentive to switch from Quark. But if you&#39;re dealing with Unicode, you already
    have all the incentive you need.

  body: '&#40;Note that in the context of this post, the term &#34;AAT&#34; refers
    to the use of advanced AAT layout features in Latin-based fonts. Its more compelling
    features center around non-Latin international support, which is outside the scope
    of my work, though it does interest me.&#41; <BR> <BR>I think AAT&#39;s chances
    are very slim. I think it will actually die out if Apple keeps it as an Apple-only
    format. Certainly there are very few compelling reasons to develop an AAT font.
    For better or worse, I seem to have stumbled onto one such reason. &#40;See below...&#41;
    <BR> <BR>However, if some company like Quark, Macromedia, Corel, or any other
    non-OS-selling non-competitor to Apple approached Apple and said &#34;we&#39;d
    like to develop the next version of our app to include AAT support, provided you
    give us an AAT port to Windows,&#34; I think Apple would be more receptive than
    they were when Microsoft asked for it. My understanding is that it was an issue
    of money at the time, not just &#34;ewww yer Microsoft, no way.&#34; Keeping in
    mind, of course, that Microsoft worked with Apple on Truetype way back when. <BR>
    <BR>AAT has one main advantage over OT right now. It&#39;s fairly easy to build
    an AAT-savvy app for a Mac. In fact the tools to do it come in the box with Mac
    OS. I was able to do it myself in a single afternoon, and I happen to consider
    myself fairly crappy when it comes to coding Objective C. The case is not the
    same for OT. I don&#39;t know where I can get a stable, shipping OT support library
    that works pretty seamlessly with Mac OS just yet. ICU, Pango, and Sun&#39;s new
    Java-based library look promising, but they&#39;re not all really finished yet
    &#40;at least when I last checked&#41; and their open-source, Linux-heavy roots
    suggest that they likely won&#39;t include specific code that makes them easier
    to integrate with Aqua. X11, yes, but I&#39;m not going to waste time struggling
    with a cruft-encrufted 20-year-old GUI environment with a million different ways
    to do the same thing, all poorly documented. X11 is the only piece of code that
    keeps Linux off the desktop. But that&#39;s another discussion. <BR> <BR>Now I
    keep hearing that Apple is working on adding OT feature support to the AAT Cocoa
    libraries, which would be a godsend. Strangely, Apple doesn&#39;t seem as averse
    to OT as you Adobe folks are to AAT. And I&#39;d personally prefer OT support
    inside AAT, cos right now I&#39;m working on a project for a customer, and we
    just finished the OT features, and I&#39;m &#34;porting&#34; them to <A HREF="http://fieldworks.sil.org"
    TARGET="_top">Graphite</A> so Windows users can get to them without spending $700
    on InDesign. I hope that the XML-based AAT tools that Apple unveils at the upcoming
    ATypI will let me do the same for AAT, so users of this font who own Macs can
    use it in WorldText instead of buying InDesign. <BR> <BR>Not that I have anything
    against InDesign, it&#39;s just hard to convince the home user market to fork
    out $700 to use a font, especially when they only need it rendered in a simple
    text-editor way. <BR> <BR>So OT has almost every piece of the puzzle: a shipping
    app, more apps on the way, shipping fonts, font feature development tools, and
    pretty good support from Windows. AAT has the one missing piece I need, which
    is support for developing feature-savvy <I>applications</I> for MacOS. <BR> <BR>If
    Adobe suddenly released an SDK that let app developers use OT features on MacOS
    &#40;essentially CoolType or a subset thereof&#41; then I would see no reason
    for AAT&#39;s continued existence. <BR> <BR>If Adobe suddenly released a simple
    OT-savvy text editor &#40;with printing enabled&#41; for MacOS and Windows, I
    wouldn&#39;t have to mess with AAT <I>or</I> Graphite. I&#39;m dealing with these
    technologies because they come with free feature-savvy text editors. Conclude
    for yourself how silly I feel about this. <BR> <BR>--John <BR> <BR>P.S. Graphite
    does some pretty cool stuff, if you haven&#39;t checked it out yet. John Hudson
    suggested it to me a while back. I wish they had a Mac version.'

  body: I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any major part of this analysis I&#39;d disagree
    with, except that I&#39;m dubious as to whether Apple would port AAT in exchange
    for a single developer&#39;s support. I&#39;m also dubious as to whether any single
    app developer &#40;other than Microsoft and Adobe&#41; could release a new AAT-friendly
    app and generate sufficient demand for AAT fonts. I suppose one could argue that
    Quark could do it. However, if they weren&#39;t doing it for version 6, I think
    it would be far too late for them to change the direction of the type industry
    by version 7. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

    Things could get interesting if <I>multiple</I> vendors approached them at the
