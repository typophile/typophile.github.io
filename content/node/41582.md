body: This font is used in a few of the <strong>dialogue in the dark</strong> ad campaigns,
  most notably the one in Japan seen [[http://www.dialoginthedark.com/|here]].  The
  font has been clipped so that only partials of each letter are showing.  The letter
  elements that I have been focusing on would be the slight upward hump in the <strong>D</strong>
  and the wide and dipping top of the <strong>A</strong>.  The lower serif on the
  <strong>L</strong> lends itself to the courier font family... but I am stuck.  Any
  Ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/top_logo_6168.jpg]

    unable to locate one that matches these letters.  The next step will be just to
    trace these letters and move on...\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;..but still,
    It would be just grand to <em>know</em>, you know."

  body: "This is such an odd serif font that it seems like it should be relatively
    easy to locate it -- the K and A in particular are not typical -- but searching
    with Identifont, my Serif Font ID Guide, and looking at every slab serif in MyFonts
    did not come up with anything even slightly resembling it. \r\n\r\nThis is a mystery
    to me, but it feels like something I <em>should</em> know. The flat A top seems
    very Art Nouveau or 19th Century, and it's making me nuts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Dan Solo's version of an 1889 typeface (Rivet) that he called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/riviera/|Riviera]]
    shows an example of why this felt like an antique serif to me. Notice the K and
    A, in particular. This font is one I really hope we get an answer for.\r\n\r\nMark
    Simonson, Mike F. or Angel would often be people to come up with ones like this.
    Any of you out there?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "This is maddening.  I really think this font has been burned in to my retinas.
    \ Final call out for help on this before I give up on my quest for knowledge and
    just trace the damn thing and remain ignorant.  But then again, it has been a
    pretty good challenge.\r\n\r\n--Baden"

  body: "This one is still haunting me too.\r\n\r\nI searched Veer (Serif) and FontPool
    (Slab), and so far the ONLY font I found that even had a similar A and K was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/cinecav-x/|Cinecav
    X]] by Ray Larabie (Typodermic). The sans versions are the most similar, but I
    really don't believe your font was made by adding serifs to this font. The serif
    brackets and the curving of some of the strokes add much more personality to your
    sample than almost any font I looked at that was supposed to be in this category.
    The one that felt closest in general style, though not structure, was Bob Alonso's
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/wonka/|Wonka]]. If you widened it the
    resemblance would be stronger.\r\n\r\nI was hoping we'd get some help from a few
    of the folks who've spent a lot of time scouring the more obscure sources, but
    apparently no one else recognized this either. Maybe it is time for both of us
    to move on.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
