    It is a little slow on dialup, but is worth <BR>the wait. For once, the on-screen
    previews are BIG. I like  <BR>big samples!  <BR> <BR>kris

  body: Great faces. Arnhem is probably my favourite. But I miss a few words about
    each face. Take Monitor, for example. Is it a screen-optimized font? <BR> <BR>The
    interface is nice too, although I don&#39;t really like PDF-links from Flash websites.
    And, wasn&#39;t &#39;security&#39; the main reason for typedesigners avoiding
    Flash showings?

    how anyone could &#34;rip&#34; the characters from the swf. Maybe I just don&#39;t
    know enough about Flash, but it seems secure to me. <BR> <BR>Speaking of silly-funky-fresh

  body: Hmm... seems I was wrong. There appear to be at least a few tools that can
    extract glyphs embedded to a swf-file. I am still not sure about if it is possible
    to extract a full font from the file.

  body: 'there are tools to extract the font data, but none of them can&#39;t extract
    the metrics, as flash simply doesn&#39;t use them. even obfuscating the swf doesn&#39;t
    help. or in other words: there is no protection against ripping fonts from flash
    files if you embedd all characters. i just like offering pdf&#39;s that have embedded
    the fonts instead of converting them to raster or outlines. lars'

  body: Why does Arnhem have such short ascenders and capital letters? I thought this
    was supposed to be a newspaper font. Is this supposed to enhance readability?

    are apparently too long, though.
