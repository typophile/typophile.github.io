body: "Hello folks, I'm happy to announce that a new typaface of mine is now released.
  Here follows the presentation. I hope you enjoy the font.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hachura-tp_3700.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>[[http://www.outrasfontes.com/hachura.htm|Hachura]]</strong>
  is an impressionist typeface designed by <strong>[[http://www.outrasfontes.com/about.htm|Ricardo
  Esteves Gomes]]</strong>. Its general proportions are based on the garalde models,
  with traditional roman serifs. It was initially made by hand using a drawing technique
  to create a font that simulates the unfinished aspect of a work in constant progress.
  This textured face is useful for display sizes, making a very visible presence.
  Because of its basic dimensions and careful distribution of black and white, it
  still also very readable in text sizes like 10 or 8 points.\r\n\r\n<strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/hachura/|Hachura]]</strong>
