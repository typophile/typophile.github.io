body: "Hi!!\r\n\r\nI'd like to share with you guys the concept of a new font I'm working
  on... it's the beginning, but it's right now that most of the decisions should be
  made.\r\n\r\nI expect to design a legible headline font, that could be used also
  on about 12pts in small passages of text.\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to have a mechanical,
  industrial and geometric look...\r\n\r\nI specially would like your opinions on
  two issues:\r\n\r\n- the \"a\" design... there are three (the first one seems the
  best to me).\r\n\r\n- Note that b p d q aren't just mirrored images of one and other.
  I believe I've got it right, based on the clockwise movement when drawing the letter...
  even this font concept not having anything to do with calligraphic origins, it looks
  nice (at least to me).\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think...\r\n\r\nmany regards
  from sunny Brazil!\r\n\r\nFabio"

    be useful as well, at least as an option. Given the overall slant of many elements
    of the face, I wonder if a more Jensonian e with a slant might not look better.
    \r\n\r\nI look forward to seeing more as the face develops."

    looks better in this font.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.focodesign.art.br/others/IronFour_050607.pdf\r\n\r\nI'm
    bringing to the table also new versions of \"l\" and \"i\": now curvy at the baseline...
    \r\nAt first glance, I think it helps legibility, but they look out of shape when
    placed beside to the other characters.\r\n\r\nIt's a hard decision... the more
    I test and explore, the better...\r\n\r\nthks\r\n"

    the first \"a\" but the second one looks more part of the font.\r\n\r\nThe new
    \"i\" and \"l\" are great but be careful about kerning. \"in\" combination needs
    kerning.\r\n\r\nI would change letters:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>g - I'd change the descender
    because it looks distracting to me\r\n<li>c - I would close the aperture a bit
    because it looks wide open\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nOtherwise. Great font. Looks like some
    FF font. Very sleek and modern. I can see it used for various different applications.
    Make shure you make other weights too."

    body: "Thank you both!\r\n\r\nHere we go:\r\n\r\nLitera,\r\n\r\n>I like the first
      \u201Ca\u201D but the second one looks more part of the font.\r\nYes, but I
      think that's because it's too similar to forms used in bpdq, and that lowers
      the legibily of the a as it lowers differentiation.\r\nI guess I'll have both
      designed, and add the second a in the opentype stylist alternate feature.\r\n\r\n>The
      new \u201Ci\u201D and \u201Cl\u201D are great but be careful about kerning.\r\nYes,
      but I'll worry about kerning only in the last stages of development.\r\n\r\n>Make
      shure you make other weights too.\r\nSure! This is the light weight. I plan
      to design Light, Regular, Bold and Black, with italic (problably oblique) forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam,\r\n\r\nVery
      well noticed. The higher point of the H (with diagonal cut) should equal the
      overshoot of the O. I've done this on lowercases, but forgot in the uppercase.
      Thanks for seeing this now and prevent me to design others with wrong proportions.\r\n\r\n>g
      - I\u2019d change the descender because it looks distracting to me\r\nYes, I'll
      try a diagonal descender, maybe it suits best.\r\n\r\n>c - I would close the
      aperture a bit because it looks wide open\r\nI'm sorry but I'll have to disagree
      on this one. Different from Dax for example, I'd like to make the characters
      with aprox similar widths. I believe it looks more contemporary (different than
      classic proportions that has forms like c with almost half of general widths).\r\n\r\nAgain,
      I do appreciate your help.\r\n"

  body: "This has promise. Good luck with it!\r\n\r\nOne comment: because of the points
    on the H, it should come up higher to look even with the O--maybe as high as the
    O or higher. Test it out and you will see what works best, but I bet it will be
    different than it would be with a flat H. Similarly try out varying the stem of
    the n, i etc. compared to the arches, the o, etc.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ok. You are right about the \"a\" I started to like it anyway. But to my
    opinion its eye is leaning a bit left.\r\n\r\nAbout the \"c\" letter. I didn't
    mean to close it to that extent. What distracted me was that its aperture looks
    wide not even parallel. It looks wide open because the stroke on top has angled
    ending.\r\n\r\nJust my opinion."

    body: "Hi Litera,\r\n\r\nOkay, I get it now... but still, I believe it's set correctly.\r\nThe
      upper stroke is a little longer to compensate the angle (diagonal), different
      form the bottom (square). This difference is almost the same as the overshoot
      between round and square strokes. Here's a close up with guidelines as reference.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/c_6355.jpg]\r\n\r\nthks

  body: I think what Litera is talking about is not that the upper stroke is too short
    (and it may indeed still be a little short visually), but that the arms of the
    c visually look open beyond the parallel, sort of sprung open. I think that visually
    to look parallel--and you might want them bent in even more than that--you will
    have to either bend them in slightly, or flair them slightly, as the flairs on
    the terminals in Frutiger...

  body: "Thank you William. Spot on.\r\n\r\nOne more thing. When (if) bending them
    in, you should do that only with the top arm. Bottom one is probably ok because
    it's very geometric. And with top arm you should probably bend in only the \"inner
    line\" of the of it. The one in the aperture."
