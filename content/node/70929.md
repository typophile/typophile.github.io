  on the subject of \"Font Pairing\", and I am looking for some website where I could
  find some HQ scans of magazine spreads or other editorial work I could use as examples.\r\nI
  got a few nice scans from magazines and books,  but right now I am thinking about
  using the net to broaden my field of research (and to save some money for printing
  the thesis :)\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest any flickr group / blog / archive where
  I could find some interesting pictures?\r\nThis is what I found so far - in case
  someone else might find them useful.\r\n\r\nhttp://thingstolookat.blogspot.com\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/goodmagazine/sets/72157618896371005/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/ffranchi/\r\n"

  body: "Unless you show type at \"lifelike\" resolution, 100% size as, you are not
    showing it properly, especially text type.\r\nTypography is all about the relationship
    of size and detail, as opposed to layout, which is more about shape and proportion\r\n\r\nGenerally
    speaking, scans don't have anywhere near enough resolution.\r\nThe standard practice
    for \"HQ\" is considered to be around 300 dpi Greyscale or \"colorscale\" (RGB
    Color/CMYK Color), for halftone reproduction in print, but that is nowhere enough
    resolution for text type, which operates under a different paradigm: high-contrast
    linear, not \"scalar\" (tonal).\r\n\r\nA technique I have used is to scan the
    full page in colorscale mode, to show layout, and accompany it with a detail of
    type, if it is black type on white paper, as bitmapped image at 100% size as:
    http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/4theMass.pdf\r\n\r\nI also like to see magazine
    spreads reproduced as \"objets\", i.e. photographed as an object, with vignetted
    dropshadow, rather than scanned flat -- so I know for sure where the trim is,
    and because they <em>are</em> things."

  body: "@Chris: Thanks Chris, I don't know why, I was expecting to find only indipendent
    magazines and lowquality type on issuu but I glimpsed some interesting stuff.\r\n\r\n@Nick:
    I see your point :) I will consider using both scans and real-sized reproduction
    of type.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome almost decent-sized from Internazionale redesign by Mark
