  body: "This scan has me thinking about the principles which guide my approach to
    type design. By most measures it could be said this face is inconsistent and awkward.
    My instincts say, the e/u are way to narrow -- except for the \xE9 which is better
    -- and the h/n are from different planets. Thus begins the process of ironing
    out all the quirks, stripping the life from (my) type. Case in point, I always
    hated Weiss. It's so campy amateur in its details (see the s). But now it\u2019s
    growing on me in a Frank Heine Tribute kind of way. Certainly there is a balance
    to be found between quirkable and workable, especially for text. But I am inspired
    to crank the dial a few notches back toward quirky.\r\n\r\nAnyhoo, I have no idea
    what this type is. It is both bizarre and beautiful. Thanks for posting."

  body: I had similar thoughts when I saw Christian's <a href="http://typographica.org/000876.php">typeface
    for the Houston Chronicle</a>. I love that the many layers and complexity of type
    can often prove myself wrong.

  body: "I can say, the typeface has really nice text image, when I look at printed
    page. \r\nThe details are strange, I agree. But it is ok, in small size, like
    it is.\r\nI will maybe try to look in old Monotype specimen in library.\r\nThank
    you very much! Thanks for your time!"

  body: I tried to read a book by Hendrik Willem van Loon in 1947 in this type, and
    gave up. I got too distracted looking at the fresh juxtapositions of the varied
    character groups going by and couldn't concentrate on the text!
