  body: '1.  <BR>A TrueType font is a font with an sfnt table format structure utilising
    quadratic B-spline curves for outlines.  <BR>  <BR>A PostScript font may have
    a variety of different formats &#40;Type 1, Type 3, sfnt &#40;see below&#41;,
    etc.&#41;; it is most easily distinguised from a TrueType font by its use of cubic
    Bezier curves for outlines.  <BR>  <BR>An OpenType font is a font with an sfnt
    table format structure utilising <i>either</i> quadratic B-spline &#40;&#39;TrueType
    flavour&#39;&#41; or cubic Bezier &#40;&#39;PostScript flavour&#39;&#41; curves
    for outlines. An OpenType font may also contain <i>optional</i> tables that enable
    sophisticated glyph substitution and positioning.  <BR>  <BR>All this information
    is readily available from Microsoft and Adobe&#39;s websites.  <BR>  <BR>...  <BR>  <BR>3.  <BR>Yes,
    this is what makes it a monospaced font: <i>all</i> the glyphs have the same advanced
    width.'

    neither. But I suspect that Roy is going to start a &#39;basic terms 3&#39; thread
    to find out what quadratic B-spline curves are. <BR> <BR>M
