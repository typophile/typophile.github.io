body: Hi, <BR> <BR>How do the seperate accent signs in the slots 246-255 function
  &#40;circumflex, tilde, macron, etc.&#41;? <BR>I use them as a ghost &#40;Copy Reference&#41;
  and past them in the appropriate character. But is there also an other way to use
  them? Perhaps in a certain keyboard combination? I could until now never find out
  how they work. <BR>I never use them seperately, but I see they have a certain spacing
  that looks like they &#42;could&#42; be used normally. <BR> <BR>Where do you use
  them? <BR> <BR>Thanx, <BR>Ren

  body: Well, not necessarily, I guess. <BR>You don&#39;t actually have to create
    the accentuated  <BR>characters by &#39;composing&#39; them &#40;referencing two  <BR>elements
    and combining them in one, like &#39;

    keys that are normally used to type standard accented characters. But, instead
    of typing the dead key followed by a letter, you type the dead key twice. <BR>
    <BR>By using negative kerning or other tricks, you can make custom accented characters
    in standard graphics or page layout programs.'
