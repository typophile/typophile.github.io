  href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/17772.html">old thread</a>&#41;
  to reconstruct Crouwel&#39;s New Alphabet. I wasn&#39;t able to find a full sample
  of all the characters so I extrapolated from what I could find and came up with
  a complete ASCII set. I put it all together in a free Opentype font. You can find
  the font and more info at my <a href="http://www.xtypa.com/archives/000041.html">weblog</a>.
