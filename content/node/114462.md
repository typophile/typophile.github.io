body: "Hello fonty friends! I'm recreating some artwork provided by a client and identifying
  this font would be a great help. I think there are at least three - maybe four -
  different fonts here, but my main concern is the one for 'Debbie's\". (I'm curious
  about \"Hours\" too, but I can do that in another post.) \r\n\r\nI have checked
  Identifont, What the Font, and Bowfin Printworks (lovely site!). I also went through
  several other resources with no luck. A larger-resolution file is attached.\r\n\r\nThis
  is my first post but I'm looking forward to being a part of the community. Thank
  you in advance for your help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_check_forum_sm_4303.jpg]"
