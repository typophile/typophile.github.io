  Road Sign?? \r\n\r\nA similar one (even without the apostrophe) would help as well.
  It\xB4s that very special \"A\" I need - used for capital and small letters... \r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ballyhooly2_5178.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks - Somebody in another Forum told me that the Irish use the same typeface
    for their Signposts as the British - Transport UK Medium. But I couldn\xB4t find
    the Italic one yet. Where can I buy it? And still there\xB4s the problem with
    the \"A\"... - \"Transport\" has a usual \"A\"."

    (as Jens pointed out) that it is not really a font. It looks like someone took
    the roman and slanted it without making any curve corrections so it looks like
    roadkill instead of a road sign.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
