body: I have photocopies of a small 10-pg. book of testimonials for a Scottish ancestor
  of mine. I am guessing it was printed in the mid-1800s because the dates of the
  testimonials range from the 1830s with the newest being 1842. I don't have the original
  book, and want to reproduce it using the original font if possible. I think scans
  of the poor photocopied pages would be nearly unreadable, so this is a link to an
  image online that to my eyes looks like the same as what I have. Font ID suggestions
  will be greatly appreciated. This is probably pretty easy, but as a novice in this
  area, I am quickly getting mired in Google searches. http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/images/exhibitions/ephemera/Eph.J_21.jpg

  body: Kind of obvious, but <a href="http://www.linotype.com/1455/scotch-family.html">Scotch
    Roman</a> might be a good match.

  body: "david: this is pre-Century, but Century is derived from the Scotch Roman
    by way of De Vinne. The Monotype Modern families skyfein pointed to are pretty
    accurate revivals, as is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/\">De
    Vinne</a> - two optically scaled sizes!.\r\n\r\nThis was a <em>very</em> common
    font for books published around a hundred years ago."

  body: Thanks for the great suggestions; I had looked at Scotch Roman (among others)
    and thought that was close as well. Problem - what about the small caps? Maybe
    I don't know how to search, but none of these fonts include small caps.
