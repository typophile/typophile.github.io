  it's from the 40s.\r\n\r\ntake a look at these two figures, which are Gothic 13.
  The upper case Q is identical to the gothic 13 Q that i've attached. same for the
  lower case t, which is pretty distinctive. however, the uppercase R doesn't match
  Gothic 13's.\r\n\r\nany of you guys know any typefaces that also have these characteristics,
  other than old Gothic 13?:\r\n\r\n"

    I don't know much about wood typefaces, but reading about Hoefler's influences
    for Champion/Knockout might help you.

  body: yeah. one of the inspirations for champion and knockout has got to be it.
    the upper case R is just like Franklin gothic bold condensed- i'm still holding
    out that it's all in the same semi-mysterious old wood typeface, but there's always
    the possibility that someone mixed characters from different families. the lower
    case t is so recognizeable- definitely not franklin gothic.
