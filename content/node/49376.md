  isn't strictly the right forum as I know what I am looking for and what it is called...
  \r\n\r\nHowever, the specimen book I have found (Specimen of Printing Types by G.W.
  Bower, 1837 - at St Brides type library, London) only has five letters - A,D,E,L,R!\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know of an analogous typeface? Or another book that contains this typeface?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any time and help!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt"
