  body: "Jeff,  actually it's a MUCH cleaned up, expaned and re-thought version of
    a very old freeware release of mine-(\"Imperator Roman\").  Do you have a link
    to the HP ad campaign you mention-I'm curious and I don't think it appeard here
    in Australia....\r\n\r\nNick, To some extent I know what you mean-I did toy with
    some more classically styled numerals but they seemed to lack prescence.  Also
    had an experiement with a version of this that used Roman numeral based ligatures
    instead of digits.\r\n\r\n"

    I'd spell that \"Alchemists' \" and \"Warwickshire\". And I love village names
    like \"Chipping Heaton\" :-) \r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: Ahhhh Andreas-the perils of working on these promotional pieces late at night
    when sleep is ellusive.  It does wonders for the creative process, but it's not
    so good for the typing, spelling punctuation etc.  I'll update this image very
    soon.....
