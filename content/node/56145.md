body: "hello,\r\n\r\nwhen i was testing my new font, i discovered a funny phenomenon:\r\nthe
  printing shows some of the glyphs more bold than others, but in fontlab they are
  all equal.\r\nalso at certain sizes it\u2019s certain letters (image: E, M, Q etc),
  at other sizes it\u2019s other letters that look bold.\r\n\r\ni thought maybe the
  printers just can't handle the amount of curves.\r\n\r\nwhat do you think?\r\n\r\nbest,\r\nmarcus[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trouble_5054.gif]"

    look ok.\r\n\r\nwhat kind of hinting would you suggest?\r\ndoes it even make sense
    to make hinting for a font like this?"
