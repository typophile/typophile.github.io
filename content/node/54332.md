body: "Hi folks.  First time poster, long time lurker on Typophile.  \r\n\r\nI'm looking
  to get some feedback and/or ideas about a poster I'm designing for an event called
  \"Four to the Floor.\"  I was fooling around with more normal poster designs when
  I noticed the curious reflectivity of a lowercase \"ft\" onto a lowercase \"tf\".
  \ I've tried to play that out, though I don't totally like how the white text fits
  in.  Any suggestions would be appreciated!  \r\n\r\nThanks.  \r\n\r\nhttp://i39.tinypic.com/24wymh2.png"

  body: The idea is good and solid, but you're right, the white font isn't quite right.
    Try a bunch of sans-serif faces until you find something that looks/feels right.
