  type that there would be benefit to not only looking at individual letters but also
  at the same time comparing the likely sequences of letters and possibly words &#40;handgloves
  etc.&#41;. Sequences of letters are alluded to in a previous forum. &#40;Typophile
  Forums &#60; General Discussions &#60; Mmm, ligatures&#41; <BR> <BR>I realize that
  this isn&#39;t a new idea but I haven&#39;t really seen it put to much use. <BR>

  body: ' Since language is not &#34;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&#34; or even &#34;the
    quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&#34;, I agree that considering real words/phrases
    &#40;along with their frequencies&#41; is of primary importance. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately,
    it doesn&#39;t seem like most type designers -even those in high esteem- bother
    with linguistics. I guess type design is undervalued enough that it&#39;s simply
    not cost-effective to spend too much time making things just right; readers -and
    even most type users- can&#39;t consciously detect problems that occur as a result
    of linguistic ignorance &#40;which of course doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no point
    - is there a point in designing new fonts to begin with? Readers can&#39;t tell
    the difference between Times and Garamond&#41;. So you have to do it for personal
    satisfaction, or for love of the craft. <BR> <BR>For the past ~3 years I&#39;ve
    been collecting works that provide data and/or insight into real language, and
    I&#39;d recommend two types of references to those interested is raising their
    game &#40;this includes me, since I&#39;m far from taking advantage of -or even
    just absorbing- most of what I&#39;ve collected&#41;: <BR> <BR>1. What usually
    happens: plain word and pair/triplet/etc. frequencies, in various languages. The
    archetype is &#34;Computational analysis of present-day American English&#34;
    by Kucera and Francis, 1967. <BR> <BR>2. What &#42;can&#42; happen: improbable
    but potentially problematic language, for which I can site &#34;Making the Alphabet
    Dance&#34; by Eckler, 1996. Among the many cool things in there is a list of real
    words that contain every single possible letterpair in English &#40;like &#34;calfkill&#34;
    for &#34;fk&#34;&#41;. <BR> <BR>Considering real language in parallel to the conventional
    things like individual glyphs, preset lists of kerning pairs, control strings,
    pangrams, and extremely rare problematic words &#40;like &#34;wyvern&#34;&#41;
    helps your font work better when it&#39;s actually used, as opposed to when you
    use it in your controlled laboratory. <BR> <BR>hhp '
