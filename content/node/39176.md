  it cute? Or not cute enough? Is is spare in a good way? Or too spare?\r\n\r\nI'm
  still working on the colors too.\r\n\r\nThanks for the input,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/erininthemiddle3_sample_4611.png]"

  body: "I'm a fan of minimalist design, black and white, and cropping words - all
    of which you have. But something about this makes me uneasy. Have you tried using
    a smoother script or something a little lighter? I feel like the cursive shouldn't
    take over the card as much as it does.\r\n\r\nOn a different note: the cursive
    \"ferrell\" is lost when viewed as it is. I just thought they were squiggles.
    Maybe do the common-sense thing and put \"erin\" at the top and \"ferrell\" at
    the bottom both right-side up?"

  body: "If you're going to use a hand-written script face for \"farrell\", use one
    with a good set of alternates so the \"rr\" and \"ll\" combinations look a little
    less mechanical.\r\n\r\nWhen I tried to read the upside-down \"ferrell\", all
    I got was \"ppiaaj\".\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: I like the first one, minus the last name. Only "erin" one time in the script
    font.
