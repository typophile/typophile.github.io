    can't see it.\r\n\r\nI think it's that yet to be commercially released custom
    serif face by Hoefler & Frere-Jones that recently popped up on the board and which
    name I can't seem to remember right now. Anyone know what I'm talking about?"

  body: Just got word from [[Jonathan Hoefler]] -- it is indeed H&FJ Chronicle, and
    he told me they're going to have some big news in a few weeks. In the meanwhile
    check <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/chronicle/index.html">this page</a>.

  body: I've been wondering when this was going to be formally announced. Nestled
    between the paper samples and ads for stock images, there's an H&FJ ad for Chronicle
    in the July/August issue of Print magazine.
