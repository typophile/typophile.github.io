  body: "The way they presented it actually makes it harder to read, I think, because
    the line breaks are way too frequent. Jumping from the end of one line to the
    start of the next is quite tiring when you have to do it several times to read
    a single sentence. It breaks up any rhythm for immersive reading.\r\n\r\nBelieve
    it or not, I do think there is some potential in this technology, specifically
    the algorithm for breaking up sentences into meaningful bits. It would help for
    reading a text in a language you are learning, because parsing sentences in a
    foreign language can be difficult. Also, this might be helpful in determining
    more logical places for line-breaks in composing some forms of paragraphs, perhaps
    ragged text with massive degrees of freedom in line lengths.\r\n"

    they provided without hating it at all. Though that's equal to, what, the first
    page?\r\n\r\nThe medical abstract, however, belied the algorithm's weaknesses.
    Some sentences were presented in a way that did not logically match their true
    sentence structure, causing confusion; for instance,\r\n\"RAPA was developed to

  body: "I don\u2019t enjoy the appearance of the very frequent line breaks, but the
    key technology that they are showing here is that they are marking off all the
    phrases within a sentence. Understanding the syntax of a sentence is a major component
    of comprehension, and the line breaking is helping with that. Eye tracking research
    shows that we fixate on the last word of a sentence or phrase longer than expected.
    We seem to try to process one phrase at a time as we read. There have been studies
    as early as the 1950s showing that indicating phrase boundaries improves reading
    speed and comprehension. The effect is more pronounced with normal, adult readers
    on the poorer end of the comprehension spectrum and with children.\r\n\r\nCheers,
    Kevin\r\n"

    also works. Tom Bever did a lot of work on this in the late 80s and early 90s
    using extra horizontal space. His work was primarily about understanding which
    phrases had the largest impact on reading speed and comprehension. Unfortunately
    extra horizontal space doesn\u2019t look fantastic either."

    short line lengths. But we are all a fairly literate group here (only 1/50th of
    the spelling/grammar errors I see on other boards). Perhaps it becomes more effective
    for poor readers.\r\n\r\nIf so, we will soon see it adopted by the public school
    systems, where they have no compunction against slowing down the top 80% if it
    might be effective to the bottom 5%."

    that's a good point that (I think) demonstrates how futile the attempt is to visually
    group text into those little bites that make sense. Because language doesn't necessarily
    proceed in a linear fashion. Often the opposite is true; as Yaronimus said, this
    breaks the syntax. \r\nNow German does often have horrid sentence structure in
    that regard, like putting the verb in the end of subordinate clauses. That can
    make for strange surprises a bit akin to what I tried to do above; and I don't
    think this model would help comprehension of such sentences, more like the opposite.
