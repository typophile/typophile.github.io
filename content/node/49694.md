  Set in a modified Garamond Bold (I THINK), it just has a very calming, yet powerful
  effect to it. And I'd always wonder:\r\n\r\nHow would I, as the Designer for that
  logo, and any like it, know enough that a simple WORD/PHRASE is enough to be my
  client's logo? Does it suddenly strike you? Do you say to yourself that no symbol
  or additional accents are good enough to accompany this word?\r\n\r\nMore importantly:
  How do you approach a client? How do you say, \"Well I know you're paying me a lot
  of money, but I really think the best I can give you is our name in this font...\"\r\n\r\nEtc.
  Etc.\r\n\r\nThoughts? "

  body: "I think that companies that can get away with a simple logotype are those
    with already extraordinary names. Abercrombie & Fitch doesn't need a mark to identify
    itself because it is identified by its name.\r\n\r\nConversely, companies like
    AT&T or Apple don't have names that can really stand alone without an icon. Hence
    Apple's almost exclusive use of their apple to brand their company or AT&T's use
    of their striped sphere.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that companies with memorable
    names don't need to try hard to create associations with other icons to strengthen
    consumer recognition. An understated yet elegant application of a type treatment
    is often the best way to let the name speak for itself. \r\n\r\npenn"

    companies need less complicated logos than unknown companies, who fair better
    with a more eye catching solutions that visually describe what they do."
