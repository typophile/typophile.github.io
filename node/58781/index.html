		<div class="commentbody">Drop shadows have a purpose, usually to add contrast between letters and background. Google's primary-color theme stuck them with a yellow <strong>o</strong> that disappears into a white background unless you give it a shadow. 
Drop shadows used to be laborious (and therefore expensive) to make, so designers didn't use them very much. When PageMaker, Quark, and Photoshop made drop shadows available at the click of a mouse, designers and designer wannabees went crazy putting drop shadows on <em>everything</em>. (The same thing happened with gradient fills.) 
Professors and art directors who lived through the Great Drop Shadow Epidemic of the early 90s often have a phobia about them, but you have nothing to fear if you practice safe specs. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd take the criticism seriously.
Drop shadows are a quick fix, like MSG.
If your boss feels your work would benefit from a drop shadow, it may be a bit "flat".

However, there are some circumstances where a drop shadow can be quite proper, such as when running type over a lively photograph.

For the Google logo, the drop shadow adds a vernacular, amateurish quality, which is in its way representative of the Web, where so much design is non-professional.

My 2001 take on such "studio techniques": <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/BottLine.pdf">The Bottom Line</a>.

		<div class="commentbody">LMAO at <em>"Great Drop Shadow Epidemic of the early 90s"</em>

I think Nick is spot-on about the Google logo. The search portals at the time when Google first appeared were slick, busy, techy looking pages then Google came along with its simple search box. 

It <em>looked</em>  like the logo had been knocked up in thirty seconds using a pirated copy of Word by a spotty Jolt-drinking adolescent who dreams in HEX algorithms. 

I used to think drop shadows could look great, making text float above a page. It's so hackneyed and worn-out now though. Like Nick I'd only really consider using them to help text stand out over a busy picture.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">From the view point of the sign industry, it is always best to create a basic version of any logo without effects. At some point, your client is going to want a sign. If it is a flat, digital print on a substrate, soft drop shadows and textures etc. are not an issue. If it is going to be a back lit sign, or routed sign these special effects pose a problem. If your logo doesn't really look good without the effects, it isn't going to look that much better routed out of brushed aluminum, mounted on a brick wall. Exterior lighted signs with special effects generally turn into visual noise from any distance. Designers don't generally take these conditions into account when creating these really cool effects.

@Nick Shinn I understand what you are saying, but I just don't think that's the issue in this case. Likely more the fact that I happen to work in a mediocre design company that's stuck in a "desktop publishing" style rut where my boss once told me something to the effect of "we aren't here to make innovative design" and how he has a certain "look" for the design we produce at our studio. Sure I'm not totally satisfied with the way the company works and that is also part of the problem, but at the end of the day I have to pay the bills like everyone else. Two and a half years later I've found that the design we output has actually risen in quality, which I'm proud to mention. Still little of it has made it's way to my portfolio due to lack of concept.

		<div class="commentbody">I renovated the <em>Birmingham News</em> nameplate a few years ago, and at the client's request added a drop shadow to help it stand its ground on the page. I also added a "casing" (is that what you call it?)--a hard white line, technically a drop shadow too, between the type and the vignetted shadow. That can give a vignetted shadow more "pop", so that it can be quite discreet--light in tone and without much spread--and yet still do its job. More graphic, less pictorial.

Blackletter is so unlike the letterforms that modern English speakers are used to reading that we often see it as a decorative pattern before we see it as words. For some reason I don't completely understand, the drop shadow makes the masthead easier to read as words.</div>

Shadow text as an effect: not good most of the time.

Shadow text as a tool: very useful sometimes to place text on photographs with high contrast. Of course there are other ways to solve such problems, but dimming the background around the type with a shadow is one of them. Though if you can see the effect, not only sense it, you have done something wrong.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The problem with the Google logo is that the type has significant contrast between thicks and thins, and the drop shadow is too far away from the type. The resulting slivers of white impede recognition of the letterforms. It might be better with a lighter shadow, or if it were moved a few pixels up and to the left. 

Drop shadows should be used with caution and restraint.
