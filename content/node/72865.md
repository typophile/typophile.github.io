body: "I've been hired to design a sign that is going to be placed on a restored building
  that was originally built in 1927. While I have been given creative license, I'd
  like to use a typeface that is or at least feels historically accurate. \r\n\r\nI
  have had a difficult time digging up photos of signage from the original building,
  but have come up with one old photo that includes some signage and one new photo
  of some painted-over type reading \"womens dressing room\". The photos are attached
  below\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any ideas for what typefaces (serif or sans serif)
  may be appropriate to use in this instance? The sign is going to hang above the
  entrance to the building, but the same typeface that we choose here may be used
  within the building on signage as well. \r\n\r\nSuggestions don't necessarily have
  to match exactly, but within the time period would be good.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
