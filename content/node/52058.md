body: "Hi there, I'm sure this matter has been raised before, but I'd like to share
  some thoughts about it. I'm planning a book for a primary school; it's about the
  local history of our town, and it should help the kids (age 6-10) in knowning its
  main historical facts, the public characters, the old jobs, etc. It will be filled
  with pictures, drawings and illustrations, and will feature exercises too - eg,
  the young readers will have to answer questions and fill the empty spaces provided
  in the pages. Now, one of the main thing here of course is the choice of typeface.
  The first typefaces I have thought about are, for obviuos reason:\r\n\r\n- Sassoon
  Primary\r\n- Century Schoolbook (ATF)\r\n\r\nWhich are very different indeed. Sasson
  seems a natural choice but I'm wondering if Century Schoolbook could work as well.
  I'd also like to discuss some other choices.\r\n\r\nPS The book will be probably
  set in two colums, with text flush-left, set at about 12 points with no  hyphenation."

  body: "I don't want to sound ignorant here, but wouldn't the best typeface for a
    children's book just be a very legible and clear face?\r\n\r\nI mean, helvetica
    is clear and has a large x-height which I think would help young eyes recognize
    familiar shapes.  I'm certainly no helvetica evangelist, but it's just the most
    obvious for my argument.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a school of thought that would
    lean towards serifed faces, in which case wouldn't a slab serif be legible?\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if, like talking baby-talk to a baby can prolong its actual understanding
    of language, I wonder if novelty fonts that adults recognize but require more
    experience and intelligence to read could make it impossible for a child to read?\r\n\r\nI
    had a look at the ones you suggested here and they do look good, I'm just wondering."

    letters and compiling them into words; to directly reading multi-letter clusters.
    The latter benefits from serifs; the former does not benefit, and might very well
    suffer from serifs.\r\n\r\nIt's useful here to distinguish between learning to
    read versus reading to learn. So if you're teaching 8-10 year olds to read [better],
    you might want to use serifs; but if your main purpose is to allow 6-10 year olds
    to read about something as easily as possible, I would avoid serifs. It's not
    that most kids simply freeze when they see a serifed letter of course, it's that
    some will become frustrated (without necessarily even realizing it). By the same
    token, ideally you would use a looser font with a large x-height, at a somewhat
    large point size (although those approaching 10 might be held back by such typography).\r\n\r\nThat
    said, there are about 2 million* choices that would be better than Helvetica.
    For one thing, this book is about your town, which is in northern Italy today,
    not in Switzerland 50 years ago. Issues of legibility and readability do not preclude
    cultural considerations.\r\n\r\n* Well, OK, not 2 million. More like 2000.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    seen anything that would suggest this is true. I believe that once children learn
    to decode words (have phonemic awareness and understand the spelling to sound

    more efficient readers the more time they spend reading. This continues throughout
    one\u2019s life, not just in childhood.\r\n\r\nCheers, Kevin"

  body: "> What is the evidence for this?\r\n\r\nI've seen two sources that concluded
    that age 10 was the average of this shift. One I forget (I can find it if you...
    pay me? :-) the other is \"Legibility in Children's Books\", Watts and Nisbett,
    1974.\r\n\r\nWhatever the age is, I believe there must be a shift at some point,
    because I believe adults can read blurry clusters of letters (otherwise they would
    have no trouble reading long novels in sans, but THEY DO HAVE TROUBLE). The only
    way there wouldn't be a shift is if adults read by compiling letters into words,
    as young children do (if more efficiently). You know what I think of that theory.\r\n\r\nDon't

  body: "I am unfamiliar with Watts & Nisbett, though look forward to reading it eventually.
    What evidence to they provide that supports your point?\r\n\r\nThe typical understanding
    is that brain structures become less capable of changing at puberty. The brain
    is incredibly malleable at birth, but reaches critical windows for learning, where
    learning becomes more difficult afterwards. For example before the age of 5, learning
    a new language is nearly effortless. Learning a new language after 5 but before
    puberty is harder, but it\u2019s very likely that you\u2019ll learn to speak it
    without an accent. Learning a new language after puberty is certainly still possible,
    but more difficult, and few will sound like native speakers. I wouldn\u2019t expect
    any brain organization to change at puberty, such as a change in reading mechanisms.
    If there was a change I would expect to find a drop in reading speed at this time
    while adapting to the new reading technique (perhaps you would expect a sudden
    increase?), but reading speed gradually increases during primary school, high
    school, and all the way through college. A long gradual increase sounds to me
    like improving a single reading technique with years of practice.\r\n"

  body: "Watts and Nisbett was a long time ago for me! Sadly I'm not the organized
    professional scientist that you are. I [have to] rely more on the nebulous aggregate
    impression of all the things I've read and processed. This makes it harder for
    me to formally convince people (well, at least Westerners), but I feel it also
    makes my conclusions more likely to lead to practical improvement. For example
    there seems to be no room for anecdotal evidence in your method; it's as if it
    never existed. The stance that \"serifs cannot help reading because my model of
    reading says they can't\" is not what I call Science. Doubt is the catalyst.\r\n\r\nPuberty:
    what I've read does not match what you state. My belief is that puberty is not
    the end of a phase, it is itself a period of pronounced transition from one phase
    to another. Many parents almost don't recognize the behavior of their children
    when they enter puberty! And when they come out they're not who they were before.
    Many things change in the brain, and I include reading strategy in that. Simply
    put, puberty is a transition from learning to doing. Learning the letters, to
    reading text. Not the same thing.\r\n\r\n> A long gradual increase sounds to me
    like improving\r\n> a single reading technique with years of practice.\r\n\r\nIt's
    strange to think that the human brain must be so one-dimensional and clunky. In
    my reading model (using the term loosely) there is a gradual introduction of the
    \"adult\" reading strategy*, applied in a way as to avoid a performance drop.
    The brain being obsessed with efficiency, it refuses to suffer a drop in performance.
    And in order to do this it gradually moves from letterwise decipherment to immersive
    reading (picking up blurry clusters of letters). So bouma reading replaces letterwise
    reading to the extent that the former is ready to take on the responsibility.
    And it never replaces it fully, because letterwise reading still makes more sense
    in the fovea. This last bit is what your field testing is picking up; but it's
    failing to pick up immersion. When it comes to reading, good field testing is
    very very very hard. It's like Huey said. And he knew what he was up against even
    though he was a century behind us not because of some study he read, but because
    he had good instincts. We are not robots, and scientists who try to think like
    robots are just wasting time/money.\r\n\r\n* Which gets better over time all the
    way into senility because the brain gets increasingly assured in taking guesses
    at boumas, through increased exposure to real, contextual boumas in text. It starts
    getting better at guessing at increasingly blurry (deeper into the parafovea)
    and low-frequency boumas.\r\n\r\nThis transition from full-letterwise to mostly-bouma
    reading is sort of like a really good automatic transmission in a car: your speed
    does not drop when upshifting, without you doing or thinking anything consciously
    different. It's a somewhat complex trick, and the brain is much more complex.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Sassoon P was intended to help in the process of learning to write, not so much
    in the process of learning to read. And there have been done tests that indicate
    that starting to learn reading with ALL CAPS only texts is the best way to do
    this. Caps differ more from each other than lower case glyphs. But we are talking
