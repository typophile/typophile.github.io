  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm about to create a concrete hearth for our fireplace. The hearth will be 1' x 5'. I'm toying with the idea of putting an inset quote into the face of it using laser-cut core 10.

I really like James' Recovery revival (and this would be a fun excuse to buy it):

http://www.typetrust.com/fonts/font.php?id=NzQ5

So I made a (really) quick mock-up. I didn't do any letterspacing and just used the online typesetter for now. 

The house was built in 1927, so I think it's roughly the same era as the typeface references. It's also a nice fat face so would be easier to inset into the concrete. It is latin, so perhaps that's a bit of conflict with the era of the language.

Thoughts? Suggestions?

		<div class="commentbody">I wouldn't use larger caps for the initial letters.

I would make the depth extremely slight - almost invisible. Anything more and you will tire of it soon enough, and start hating it, and hence the entire house.

The font choice is cool, I would just worry about that "G", especially in a foreign language. I might try out Penumbra too.

		<div class="commentbody">I was assuming you will engrave the text into the concrete, but now I think I understand that the letters will be brass or something, and laid in flat. That sound good too, but in that case I would use a silvery but low-sheen metal. My point is it should not grab the eye, even though it's cool - it should be a subtle element in your whole.

BTW, concerning your desire for historical accuracy: all things being equal that's certainly a good thing, but fair-faced concrete* certainly isn't period to the 1920s, so your choice of font can be much more free, to match the overall atmosphere.

* My dad, an engineer, calls it that - is that what you guys call it?

		<div class="commentbody">1927... what kind of home? craftsman? mission? foursquare? I'd think that would drive your decision. This feels deco to me, not arts & crafts ala ITC Rene Mackintosh P22 Dard Hunter etc. But then, a concrete fireplace in an old house says you may not want a period look as Hrant noted. Post us some photos or more info. Cool project. I've got a mantle to do at my house (1938) "before christmas."

BTW Hrant, board formed concrete indoors is the rage.. that's my guess.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">hrant...ah...yes it'd be flush with the surface. I was thinking stainless originally, but was afraid of not having any contrast against the gray of the concrete.

Randy...as for as true authenticity, that's already been thrown out the door a while ago. It's a 1927 quasi tudor/quasi arts and crafts. It has elements of both but doesn't scream either. First floor formal rooms are original. Bath is modern. Kitchen is 'contemporary (remodelled by previous owners) and this mantle is going in our finished basement against an existing massive brick fireplace. The basement is maybe 'loft styled' with stained concrete floors. So, yea, it's a mix, so not too worried about the neighborhood architectural board knocking at the door. ;0)

I'd agree with the deco vibe, but Mackintosh, as much as I love that, would be too over the top in this house, IMHO. At least in the basement it would be.

James...good point! I look forward to working with that typeface! 

Granted all this is predicated on being able to actually afford laser cut letters, so we'll see if I can get over that first hurdle. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting. Ah.. I see you're in twin cities, land of excellent old houses -- Curious to see what a quasi-tudor-ac looks like. I say go with your original thought. It has a streamlined golden age of industry feel that seems like it would fit the mood you're creating in the basement.

Only other thought I had is to go completely ornate in a move toward contrast and also to inject some humor into the quote: "it is pleasant to do nothing." By ornate, I mean Marian Bantjes-esque overthetoppedness:

There's probably a more specific term for the style. ;o)

Here's an unflattering google streetview shot of it:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/house_3823.jpg]

I love Marian's work and I get what you're saying (and think it's a good idea). Alas, that would be more of a fabrication issue in this case. 

I found out that one can water-cut copper, so I think I'm aiming for copper now over the core10. Waiting patiently for the price estimates...</div>

I was originally thinking of going smaller, and actually justifying it lower-right. More of a 'oh! There's a quote there' surprise. 

That said, if I do go with copper, the center would maybe offer some interesting reflections from the fire.
