body: I added entries for [[Edward Johnston]], [[Stanley Morison]], [[William Morris]],
  [[Dard Hunter]], [[Victor Hammer]], [[Hermann Zapf]], [[Hartley & Marks]] (link
  probably won't work due to a bug in the Typowiki parser), [[Robert Bringhurst]],
  [[Elements of Typographic Style]], and [[John Hudson]] (who will probably be bemused
  by what I chose to write about him). All of those are sketchy, to greater or lesser
  degrees, but you gotta start somewhere. I note without comment that a lot of you
  are writing about yourselves and your / your company's products. I thought some
  history might be nice to have as well, especially as a lot of this stuff isn't yet
  in <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">the Wikipedia</a> (although I suppose I should
  add some of this to that as well). Feel free to annotate, correct, or rewrite my
  deranged scribblings, and drop me a note or a comment and let me know what you think.
