  body: "That looks like the sample of MacKeller, Smiths & Jordan \"Ronaldson Old
    Style\" shown in Mac McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century\".
    It goes back to 1884, and several foundries,like Monotype, Linotype and Intertype
    had their own versions made to fit their machines. Keystone called theirs \"Keystone
    Old Style\".\r\n\r\n   - Mike Yanega"

    like ITC Tiffany, and the Ronaldson sample I saw does not.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: You could probably get pretty close with Canada Type's <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/">revival
    of Ronaldson</a> by scaling it horizontally. The "W" in question is in the Alt
    font.
