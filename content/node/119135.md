body: "Hi everyone\r\n\r\nI need to have a web template turned into a photographer
  website - icetemplates.com/shop/photographer-responsive-html5-onepage-template/\r\n\r\nThe
  work stipulates logo change, replacement of images everywhere they're found with
  my own, populating the pages with the text of my own, setting up the contact form,
  remove certain irrelevant elements from the footer, and also change colors at several
  places via CSS.\r\n\r\nMore details will be shared after hire.\r\n"
