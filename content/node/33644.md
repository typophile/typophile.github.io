  body: I would go with 4, never 3 and maybe 1 or 2. Centering the name at the top
    is very 19th Century - so if you do restoration carpentry then it might be ok
    but in that case choose a 19th Century  font. Try typing a letter on 4, I think
    it creates a nice feel.

  body: "I'm liking 4 too. But screen that watermark WAY back. What looks fine on
    a blank sheet soon overpowers a a page with actual type on it.\r\n\r\nI'd also
    suggest moving the black bar over another 1/2\" or so so it could line up with
    the left margin of the actual text on the page."
