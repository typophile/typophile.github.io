  i'm going to spend some money buying a new font for text that works nicely with
  Bryant. \r\n\r\nNice would be if i'd get some tips on a sans serif as well as a
  serif to go with Bryant compressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate every tip!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'd try to find a serif that contrasts with the roundness of Bryant; try
    something sharp and readable in the ballpark of Mercury, Farnham, Newzald or even
    Warnock.\r\n\r\nFor the sans, maybe something a bit harder like Tungsten, Forza
    or Breuer?"

    work; Bryant is so quirky that it won''t be hard to find a contrasting face. I''ve
    even used Bryant with Stag and Minion. '
