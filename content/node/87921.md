  of knowledgeable people around here. I've been trying to figure out for quite some
  time how to change font names to fix this kind of issue (screenshot): http://cl.ly/CFm8\r\n\r\nI
  would like to change just some typeface names and variation names so that they're
  all clean and tidy in my Font Book, and not all separated like this.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  knows, I'd be grateful to be taught how to do this. Cheers, typophiles!"
