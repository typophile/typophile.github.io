A post-modernist approach might be to argue that the world is (as hhp says) too fuzzy to fit into the modernist perspective. <BR>One of the problems with post-modernism is its natural position hiding behind the coat-tails of the king's new clothes.  I'm sure it would be possible to say worthwhile things from a post-modern perspective, but too often its a cover for lazy thinking, which is immune to criticism because any complaints are obviously from a rationalist, modernist angle, which is just incapable of understanding the post-modern view. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Emigre <BR> <BR>Emigre -the old Emigre- is in fact the bastion of that laziness/hooliganism: countering the &quot;rules&quot; just for the hell of it, as a juvenile reaction, at most hoping there's something on the other side, sans real insight, sans real commitment. That's why it didn't really catch on - it refused to grow up, through critical introspection and objective analysis. A new movement can start chaotically, but can only sustain itself through discipline. <BR> <BR>The good news is that there's a new Emigre now, and looking at some recent font releases, maybe, just maybe they're on the golden PoMo track now (although all I for one really see so far is faint signals). If that's the case, it sure would be nice for them to admit -and analyze- their confused past. What's scary of course is that intelligent PoMo wouldn't sell very well at the moment. Well, intelligent <i>anything</i>, really&hellip; <BR> <BR>&gt; humanity is key <BR> <BR>One thing I would elaborate on that though is this: humanity isn't just formal humanism. The heart of any merit PoMo has (or could have) is the acceptance that humans are only half conscious. A serious, selfless perspective on communication is severely limited by restricting &quot;humanity&quot; to chirography, base animal emotions, or anything else: as much as possible needs to be considered, although necessarily imperfectly. And that's where Modernism implodes: it suffers from the classic Western chimera of Total Control. Give it up, people - it'll never work. <BR> <BR>&gt; Bringhurst <BR> <BR>Like most any other scheme, I find his classification useful, but imperfect. Two places it fails: <BR>1) It treats type design as an Art, and that's less than half the picture. <BR>2) Being based on existing culture, it cannot really cover anything <i>new</i>. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

Perhaps referring to the work of others well as your own. <BR> <BR>Thank you</div>
