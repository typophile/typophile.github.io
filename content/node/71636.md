body: Any help identifying this typeface would be much appreciated. My impression
  is that this face is not available digitally since its from a book published in
  1972, but just wanted to check before we have it scanned for the re-issue. Thanks!

  body: "Niiiice font. I think you're right that it's a Garamond variant of some stripe,
    but it doesn't appear to be a close match to anything on the Berner specimen sheet.
    I wasn't able to find a digital version either.\r\n\r\nMy <a href=\"http://levien.com/type/myfonts/\">LeBe
    Titling</a> might be considered close enough, but I'd hate to lose the distinctiveness
    of the original.\r\n\r\nSee <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/41572\">this Garamond
    thread</a> for more info and links about 15-century versions of Garamond."

  body: I think it could be some kind of Caslon. But it's a very quirky version.
