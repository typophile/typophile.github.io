  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Thanks to years of idle hoarding, I now find myself in possession of a dizzying and frankly unproductive number of fonts. 6,300 to be exact. 99% of which I&rsquo;m sure are utter crap, (I can honestly say out of the entire library I&rsquo;ve used maybe 30 or 40 fonts; I don&rsquo;t even know what most of them <!-- raw HTML omitted -->are<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. There&rsquo;s just too many) but as I&rsquo;ve only been making serious explorations into typography for the last year or so I have trouble picking out the subtle differences between some typefaces that would make clearing out the chaff much easier.</p>
<p>The sheer number of options I&rsquo;ve got has turned choosing type for a project is a forbidding task, and as I&rsquo;m in the process of defining and refining my identity as a designer I think now is as good a time as any to reign in my font library and bring it down to a manageable level. Before I approach this task, however, I had a few questions that would make the task easier, and I thought the knowledgeable folks here would be able to help:</p>

<p>I thank you in advance for your help. I&rsquo;m looking forward to starting the new year with my library no longer in a state of madness.</p>

<p>I think using the traditional classifications for type is helpful (sans, serif, etc.) but more subjective descriptions can be used: fat, bubbly, weak, athletic, etc. Whatever descriptions would be most helpful to you. Make as many classifications/groups/tags as you need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have the Creative Suite, and are on a Mac, you can see see [[http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/09/cs4_fonts.html|Adobe&rsquo;s list]] and [[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1642|Apple&rsquo;s list.]] Those aren&rsquo;t at all a requirement, just a common starting point for many designers. You can scour Typophile for topics on which typefaces are &lsquo;must-haves.&rsquo; There is no right number. Don&rsquo;t have too few and don&rsquo;t have too many. :)</p>
</li>

<p>I would pull out what I thought was rubbish. Either turn it off in your font manager or just save it somewhere outside your fonts folder, so you can dig in it in the future. After that, I would take the time to be discriminating. I haven&rsquo;t done it personally, but MyFonts.com has the tools to function as a personal type catalog where you could organize a library with a robust tagging system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, not to sound too harsh, but I peeked at the PDF résumé on your website and noticed that is used free fonts. Not all free fonts are bad, but know that many are of dubious quality (or complete rip-offs of established typefaces). Glutting your library full of mediocre (or downright awful) free fonts isn&rsquo;t helpful. Also, you should know where your fonts came from. Make sure you actually have a license to use the fonts you have. This isn&rsquo;t legal advice, but this [[http://www.typophile.com/node/44344|Typophile thread]] helps clarify things and touches on relevant topics.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the suggestions! Tagging by descriptions would be helpful, since I tend to search for fonts based on the moods they convey more than their technical classification. It would certainly cut down on me squinting at a dozen lines of serif fonts trying to pick out which one is more &ldquo;relaxed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crappy free fonts is one of the main reasons I&rsquo;ve been meaning to purge my library: the few quality ones I do have are pretty much what came packaged with CS3. Everything else is basically the result of downloading waaaaay too many font packs that ended up having nothing more than novelty fonts, most of which were ugly. The Adobe list you linked to as a starting point is helpful.</p>
<p>My resume is a few months out of date; I&rsquo;ve actually forgotten what fonts I used. Once I nail down how I want to present myself to potential clients going forward all of the fonts used will change. I even considered making my own just for headings ( I thought it would be a nice touch, since my ultimate career interest lies in illustration) but I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m ready for that yet.</p>
