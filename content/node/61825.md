body: "I want to print my job from InDesign, which currently is only a Black & White
  Job, with Crop Marks, but the Crop Marks are placed as CMYK (Registration).\r\nOther
  than creating manual crop marks, is there any way of outputting InDesign Crop Marks
  as a Single Black only and not 4-colour?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGordon Fogarty"

  body: "Hey Gordon\r\n\r\n2 things you could check:\r\n-have you deleted all of your
    non-black & white/unused swatches?\r\n-have you only checked \"crop marks\" in
    the print dialog box rather than any of the other options?\r\n\r\nI ran a quick
    test and my b&w job outputted with only one ink (black/K) according to pre-flight.\r\n\r\nbest
    of luck\r\n\r\nrachel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    forcing InDesign to add the extra plates
