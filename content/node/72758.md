  any ideas what this nice little serif used in Kuoni's travel brochures is, it's
  been bugging me for a little while as I can't find a match."

  body: I suppose that depends on your definition of "new". I first noticed it in
    a Kuoni brochure about a year ago, I don't know how long before then it had been
    in use.

  body: "Hmm, it seems the reason the Serif Guide didn't find this is that the E (and
    F) in the small caps version has no serif on the middle arm, but the regular font's
    E and F do have the serif. I didn't realize that KUONI EXCLUSIVE was the SC typeface.
    I am updating the Guide to include that attribute in the description.\r\n\r\n-
