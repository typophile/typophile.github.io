  body: I don&#39;t know if this problem is only mine,  <BR>but every time i try to
    post i receive  <BR>the message &#34;internal server error&#34; and  <BR>the warning
    that my post wasn&#39;t sent  <BR>&#40;while actually it has been sent&#41;.

  body: 'Yep, it happens once in a while when Typophile gets  <BR>buggy. Nothing serious
    though, it&#39;s just a bit confusing. <BR> <BR>I second your opinion about 25.006,
    but I&#39;m worried  <BR>that those kind of designs are too detailed for a T-shirt:  <BR>people
    would need to get far too close for comfort to  <BR>be able to decipher the text,
    and they don&#39;t make that  <BR>much sense when seen from afar. <BR>Not every
    brilliant idea translates well to a T-shirt.'

  body: Again, how close do you need to get to be able to  <BR>decipher the text?
    That&#39;s a big question mark for me.

  body: A shirt <i>can</i> have very small text/elements, but then it also needs a
    larger &#34;view&#34; to draw people in. To me just a bit of small text with nothing
    else is too terminally hip - it&#39;ll end up wilting anemic on Hollywood boulevard.

  body: 25.009, es muy buena, algo como el arte de kraftwerk, buena polera!.  <BR>
    <BR>25.004 no es lo que uno se espera, pero tiene un gustito, algo transgresor,
    que es bueno encontrar siempre. de quien sea, un buen gesto. <BR>

  body: There&#39;s something about 006 I just love. I have to agree with Yves&#39;
    statement about people having to get a little <i>too</i> close to read it, though.
