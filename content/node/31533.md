  the end of Feb over at MyFonts), and have been admiring some of the details on the
  modelling of each letter. One feature in particular struck me as unique in my (admittedly
  limited) experience of fonts intended for extended text. The lower case e has a
  beak (?) that points slightly *downwards*, whereas usually the beak is flat or pointing
  upwards (see image)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/relato_e_5528.png]\r\n\r\nIs
  this feature indeed unique, or are there any other text fonts that have it? "
