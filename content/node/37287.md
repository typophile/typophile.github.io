body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI think I've asked something like this before, but I can't find
  the thread and I don't think I got a answer last time.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to
  copy metrics from one font to another so that the side bearings are copied. If I
  export the metrics from one font and then import them into another font, it's the
  width and the left sidebearing that are copied.\r\n\r\nIt's my own metrics I'm trying
  to copy from an earlier version of a font to a later version where some of the glyphs
  widths have changed but I still wanted to keep the the old side bearings. Back in
  Fontographer days it was possible to copy the metrics and you could choose if you
  wanted to copy the width or sidebearing - is this the case with FL.\r\n\r\n\r\nRr
