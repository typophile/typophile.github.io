  I don't know much about it. Is freelancing common? Is technical font support done
  inhouse or outsourced? Does it make sense to look at large foundries or smaller
  independent shops? \r\n\r\nThe person in question does not design original fonts,
  she is font technical expert, knows all about font technologies of the last 15 years.
  (PS Type1, TrueType, OpenType, manual font hinting, kerning, bespoke fonts production,

  body: "Many type designers these days are one-person shops.  Some of them would
    rather farm out the technical part of the process, like truetype hinting, opentype
    coding, or even just kerning.  You could possibly market services in that way.
    \ The bigger foundries have staff to handle the technical side and occasionally
    are hiring. There are a few inbetweeners like Dalton Maag, who have small staffs
    or hire on a contract basis.\r\n\r\nIf your person has 15 years experience, why
    wouldn't she already know the business?"

  body: She should put together a portfolio and resumes and take network at the ATypI
    conference in September. And if she really does know all about manual hinting
    she should just send examples and a resume to every foundry out there, because
    right now there are more freelance hinting gigs than there are experts to do the
    work.

    not already know the business is that she worked on a salary for a well-known
    (in our part of the world, at least) font shop and never had to worry about getting
    assignments. Now her company is not in position to employ her full-time, and I
    suggested that she continues doing work solo.\r\n\r\nShe's compliling the list
    of foundries right now.\r\n\r\nApart from networking at ATypI, what would be a
    good way to reach out to individual designers?\r\n\r\n"

  body: ">>Anyone have any idea hoe large the Cyrillic font market is?\r\n\r\nNick,
    I don't really know the size of the Russian market (as measured in money), but
    ParaType is practically the only local foundry. I have a feeling that since all
    major foundries developed Cyrillic type, there must be a larger market \"offshore\",
    meaning outside of Russia. But my friend is certainly not limited to working on
    Cyrillic type, she worked on Latin and Arabic scripts as well. (and quite a bit
    of Cyrillic type for big league foundries was developed by Paratype anyway).\r\n\r\n>>I
    have purchased several of their faces, myself. \r\n\r\nChris, then chances are
    you have seen some her work already! We just finished tallying up the fonts from
    ParaType library that she was involved with, and it came to over 40 typefaces.\r\n\r\nRight
    now we are checking with employers to find out which work was under NDA and will
    be all set.\r\n\r\nWill this forum be a right place to post a resume for a review/critique?"
