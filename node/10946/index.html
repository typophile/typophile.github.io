		<div class="commentbody">Aloys Senefelder invented lithography sometime in the late 18th century, I think. I am reasonably sure, although my memory often fails me, that he was attempting to create a chemical printing process to cheaply reproduce copies of plays or stories he had written. He wrote a book about the invention of the process which is pretty detailed. Read it in school years ago, portions of it at least, but can't remember title offhand.</div>

After attempting to become an actor, he took up dramatic writing, at which he was at first fairly successful.

The accurately designed typewriter faces offered by the American Type founders Company, in such wide variety, afford every printer the opportunity of engaging in the printing of imitation typewritten letters to whatever extent he chooses.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;The type here shown, 12 point New Model Smith-Premier, is designed to be printed through silk, crepe chiffon or regular ribbon cloth. By varying the quality and amount of cloth used an impression of any weight and character may be obtained. The ribbon cloth is heaviest, and gives most weight to the type face; crepe chiffon is lightest. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;If addresses are to be filled in on the typewriter, have the stenographer of the firm for whom the work is to be done write a sample letter.

		<div class="commentbody">The process is described it more detail in the 1906 edition: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;This work can best be done by printing through crepe chiffon streached on the grippers, leaving the cloth a little slack. And using Process Inks. This method gives most satisfactory results when used on a platen press. At all times have the chiffon washed thoroughly with soap and water before using. When on a cylinder press, use Japanese silk of good quality, but light in weight. Put the silk through the same preparations as the chiffon; lock it up loosely in the form, between the type and the furniture; draw several impressions from double thickness of stock to be used on job so as to form a matrix of the cloth. Use CLEAN rollers and bearers. Use ribbons that are made from the same ink, for filling in names and addresses. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;You can then have tha assurance that the ink used in printing will exactly match the ribbon used on the typewriter for filling in the address. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Distribute the Process Ink on the plate as usual, then put in form. The first few rollings will saturate the silk with ink and it will act as an inked ribbon, biving an impression like that of a typewriting machine. The silk will last a long time and when filled up can be washed in benzine and used again.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sample pages are quite convincing.</div>
