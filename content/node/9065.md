  body: "all graff fonts (with the exception of <a href=\"http://www.handselecta.com/\">Handselecta's</a>
    work) are pretty bogus, and probably not made by any accomplished urban lettering
    artist. Most take stabs at the style and end up with scribbles, and those who
    don't research the topic will pass them off as \"graffiti\" styles...ultimately
    watering down the integrity of urban calligraphy.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the <a
    href=\"http://www.handselecta.com/fonts_hsjoker_li.html\">joker set</a> here.
    Its my best suggestion when it comes to using a graff font.\r\n\r\n99% of the
    graffiti out there is not \"Gang\" related, and I've never seen any \"cholo\"
    style fonts on the market. The closest neighbor to that would be some handmade
    blackletter font...but even that would be like trying to dress up a wolf in sheep's
    clothes.\r\n\r\nhope that helps."
