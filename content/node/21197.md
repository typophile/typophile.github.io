body: "Hey, everyone, I just assembled my fonts, some previously released on DeviantArt,
  some never before seen, on to their own website here: http://www.exclamachine.com\r\n\r\nThere
  are 9 original fonts now, from handwriting-style to ornate to weird and I'll be
  adding more this summer and fall, along with refinements to the site and more extras."
