    4-line shade effect) is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/balboa-shaded|Balboa
    Shaded]] by Jim Parkinson but /S is a bit different. More 'Sans Serif Shaded'
    with a totally off /S:  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/thorowgood-sans|Thorowgood
    Sans]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/ultinoid|Ultinoid]], [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/s/sans_serif.htm|Sans
    Serif Shaded]]\r\nI guess the best way to reproduce it perfectly might be to consider
    it as a \"condensed woodtype sans-serif with a 4-line shadow affect applied\".
    Some 'condensed woodtype sans-serif' you may find interesting: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lettering-inc/directors-gothic|Directors
    Gothic]] (/S a bit off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/classroom|Classroom

  body: "dear ryuk\r\n\r\nthanks a lot for your kind effort\r\ni already came into
    balboa, sans serif shaded and some of the others that you mention, and they're
    not bad at all;\r\nbut when i saw the display font you can look at here: http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/september/cr-october-2013-issue\r\ni
    said that this was exactly what i was and still am looking for;\r\ni also tried
    to write the CR ad, but got no answer..\r\nbalboa bold shaded and thorowgood are
    nice, but the caslon font looks much better proportionated and interesting to
    me: mainly i like the very narrow counters;\r\n\r\nanyway, thanks a lot\r\nb"
