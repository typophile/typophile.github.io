  body: "The top one was originally made by Bill Horton in 1990 and called MacHumaine.
    It was a very badly made font given away for free or as shareware. Copies can
    still be found easily.\r\n\r\nDiet Steffmann later fixed alot of the technical
    problems with the font. I think it was he who added a few ligatues as well. He
    offered it then as <a href='http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/a/alpine.htm'
    target='_blank'>Alpine</a>."
