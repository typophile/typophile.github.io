body: This feels like such a stupid question, but now I have everybody at work debating
  over what the technical name for a "double-story" lowercase "a" is called v.s. a
  "single-story". Is it just an lowercase with or without an arm? or is there a specific
  name! please help me put an end to this debate!

  body: "Hi Kaile,\r\n\r\n\u2018single-storey a\u2019 resp. \u2018double-storey a\u2019
    are certainly the most common terms, and with them, everybody knows what you\u2019re
    talking about.\r\nI have heard \u2018open/closed a\u2019, too (in German), but
    it doesn\u2019t make that much sense to me. Same with \u2018script a\u2019 (for
    the single-storey version).\r\n\r\nSome fonts that regularly have a double-storey
    \u2018a\u2019 (and \u2018g\u2019) are also available with single-storey alternatives
    for these letters. They are usually referred to as \u2018Schoolbook\u2019 or \u2018Infant\u2019
    fonts. The idea behind this is that the letterforms for reading should be similar
    to those for writing. Relevant examples would be Gill Sans Schoolbook or Bembo
    Schoolbook. However, you won\u2019t call the letter a \u2018schoolbook a\u2019
    for this reason.\r\n\r\nF"

  body: I occasionally see unicameral for the single-story and bicameral for the double-story,
    but only in works meant for serious typophiles. I just stick with single/double-story.

  body: "James -- \r\n\r\n<em>Unicameral</em> and <em>bicameral</em> used in that
    way are misnomers. The stem <em>-cameral</em> comes from the Latin <em>camera,</em>
    meaning \"room\" or \"chamber\". The terms are usually used to describe different
    forms of government with one or two legislative houses. \r\n\r\nWhen applied to
    type (i.e., by Bringhurst), these terms are usually used to describe whether an
    alphabet has one or two \"cases\" -- e.g., Latin script is considered bicameral,
    since there are upper case (majuscule) and lower case (miniscule) forms. Cyrillic
    is also bicameral. By contrast, Devanagari (the script for writing Sanskrit, Hindi,
    and others) is unicameral; there is no upper case.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit unusual to
    apply the terms to the different forms of 'a' or 'g'.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"
