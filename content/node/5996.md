body: is it &#34;safe&#34; for output to copy to the clipboard from Illustrator and
  then paste into Indesign? <BR> <BR>it is very convenient, but I don&#39;t know if
  i should go back when I&#39;m done, and properly place EPS files.

  body: If you mean &#34;will the art still be vector?&#34;, it <i>is</i> safe. Integration
    with Illustrator is one of the many beauties of InDesign.

  body: yes, I meant &#34;will the art still be vector?&#34;, and any type in the
    art print properly, etc. <BR> <BR>I love this feature. It&#39;ll save me a LOT
    of time. <BR> <BR>thank you!

  body: My favorite thing about InDesign &#40;for the moment&#41; has  <BR>to be the
    beautiful PDFs it generates. No more color  <BR>discrepancies between Quark-generated
    art and  imported EPSs. <BR>
