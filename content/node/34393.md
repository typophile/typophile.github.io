  body: Huh? Are you talking about the rendering of type or HTML? And if it's the
    fonts you are talking about, do you then mean that the rendering is like that
    on OS X instead of Vistas Cleartype. And if so, could you post comparative screenshots?

    be a new thread. It would be interesting to see a bunch of them head to head.
    These are the ones that I know of: Microsoft ClearType, Apple Quartz, Adobe (ATM?),
    Freetype, iType (Monotype), D-type (don't know if this is used anywere, but their
    samples look nice), Bitstream Font Fusion (never really seen this in action either,
    that I know of).\r\n\r\nAs for some other renderers: I really like the rasterizer
    Macromedia built into Fireworks with adjustable super-sampling, weight and sharpness.
    The new rasterizer for Flash is kind of a mess (see the insert image link at the
    bottom of the page). I really dislike the rasterizer that Adobe puts into its
    DTP apps. Photoshop anti-aliasing is mega-blurry, which is fine when you are going
    to print at 300dpi, but lousy for screen graphics. InDesign and Illustrator rely
    too much on hinting, distorting the type for on screen reading \u2014 bad for
    wysiwyg apps targeted at high res printers. It would be better for the type to
    show up a little blurrier, while giving a better sense of how the spacing and
    color are working out. I've been tricked more than once into kerning a hinted
    line of type in InDesign, only to discover upon zooming in/printing that I had
    been deceived by the hinting."

    PC and my Mac side by side. I'm comming at this as a designer of websites. PC
    running XP IE6 FF2, Mac Safari 2 .. both sides at default settings since most
    leave it like it comes out of the box.\r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with pc screen
    typography is that certain sizes of certain fonts look fantastic. But heaven forbid
    that you specify bold at that size. Or increase the size 1px. Case in point, Arial
    Bold 14px (nastified). Verdana 16px Bold (bold? bold?). Up to 17px, ok now it's
    bold, but the spacing is all wack. In fact, i would say px sizes 14+ look ghastly
    on my pc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/compare_4242.gif]\r\n\r\nNo
    fair you say? Clear Type not turned on in the PC example. How many users open
    Control Panel > Display > Effects > Screen Font > Clear Type to click that box?
    My issue is what joe pc sees when he fires up his Dell box, but Ok. Now clear
    type is active:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cleartype_6577.gif]\r\n\r\nHey
    that 17px is looking much better on the pc. Beter than the mac? Debatable. How
    is the 16px? Craptastic spacing and contrast. Mac? Still pretty decent.\r\n\r\nIn
    conclusion: on a PC without cleartype, 10% of type options get an A, 90% get a
    C-. With cleartype on, the percentages improve somewhat. Out of the box on a mac,
    100% get an A-. I'll take freedom and an A-. Call me artsy.\r\n\r\nR"

    try: If you set the anti-aliasing to \"Light\" in System Preferences in OS X,
    it makes for slightly sharper text. \r\n\r\nAnother factor: as pixel densities
    get higher, anti-aliaised fuzziness becomes less noticeable, while the wonky spacing
    and counter sizes (texture) of delta hinted renderers becomes more apparent. This
    is especially true for mobile devices, which are now commonly approaching 150ppi.
    Unhinted antialiasing looks amazing at these sizes. I'm really interested to see
    what the type looks like on the iPhone. When people start freaking out about how
    slick it looks, they of course won't know that they are reacting to the type,
    but we type nerds are used to that :)\r\n\r\nFor those that think that the crisp
    CT type with bad spacing is more useful... I simply disagree. Ugly spacing is
    less 'purdy' and less user friendly. As for designers making \"good\" fonts: at
    this point I would be happy with *different* fonts. I'm so sick of the web 5.
    Ack. Of course with CT there is no such thing as different type: it takes every
    font and crunches them all into the same shapes. Seriously, look at the examples
    above. The Verdana renders under CT look like Arial stretched out a little. Even
    the pixel versions have more flavor. [edit: this is a little bit of hyperbole,
    there are still obvious differences - but the individual flavors of the type are
    much more apparent in Quartz]."

    they're using legacy screen fonts; and they're not using Vista. That said, I've
    never been highly satisfied with CT. But, again: at least it's trying the right
    thing. To me intent is the foundation.\r\n\r\nAnd what's \"a fair amount of time\"?
    I certainly don't believe that I, or anybody else, can scientifically self-field-test
    extended readability. I've done two things: gone to Apple stores a dozen times
    and spent maybe a total of two hours looking; and I've taken very close looks
    at the bitmaps generated by the Apple renderer. Since I've been looking at -and
    making- screen fonts since 1982, this is enough to feel safe in arriving at a
    very simple conclusion: Apple does not care about improving onscreen <cite>reading</cite>;
    they care, in that ol' Modernist way, about the pretty gray blocks. And by extension:
    Apple no longer cares about type. And there's other evidence of this in other
    things that Apple has [not] done. The thing is, I wouldn't mind that too much
    if it was out in the open - but instead we get the opposite: the persistence of
    the belief -especially among graphic designers- that Apple cares about type, in
    particular cares about type more than MS. This type of denialism chaps my hide.\r\n\r\nNow,
    I don't believe MS, as a corporation, cares about type because it cares about
    us. In fact no public company can care about anything besides money. But I do
    believe that most people in the MS type department genuinely care; a corporation
    is typically made up of good people from whom it tries to milk profits; they resist
    to a certain extent, and this resistence allows for the persistence of true benefit
    to people. We know who the MS type people are - we've met them - they come and
    talk to us, ask us things. Where are the people at Apple's type department? We
    don't even know them. Peter? Haven't heard a peep from him since 2002. Who else?

    to the point where this is less and less of an issue. I do think there will be

  body: "\"But Apple has to chuck its rendering philosophy and start over.\"\r\n\r\nReally?
    Apple is moving in a direction where they define the graphics and typographics
    of their OS and applications, beyond the reach of normal users and font developers.
    This is hardly surprising considering the relatively revolutionary nature of the
    changes coming in Leopard whereby type at a particular size is much less important
    to the UI relative to the graphic appearance of a more agile set of objects. That
    is to say, Apple has finally made an OS where all the items are scaleable, (zoomable)
    in their appearance, even if they are not zoomable in their creator applications.
    As we all know from Adobe's success, zooming is a big boost to the user's perception
    of font quality. Apple's not stupid, ya know. \r\n\r\n\"More interesting reading.\"\r\nNot
    really. This is someone talking about what someone else who doesn't know what
    they are talking about said...\r\n\r\n\"Vista\u2019s rendering has two advantages
    over XP\u2019s: subpixel positioning, which effectively triples interletter spacing
    resolution\"\r\n\r\nReally? How you define \"effective\" and \"triples\", I'd

    that Randy's problem with the PC screenshots he's provided are due to the TrueType
    Instructions in the Verdana font, not with ClearType as a rendering system.\r\nThe
    TrueType instructions are effectively not used by the Mac, so the result is closer
    to what you'd get by simply scaling the actual outlines, therefore it appears
    pretty bold. On the PC without ClearType, you see the effect of the TrueType instructions
    in the font, which for smaller sizes (below 20ppm) affect the weight greatly,
    in an attempt to make the font more legible. Cleartype makes use of some of the
    TrueType instructions, but overrides others, which is why Randy sees the effect
    as \"slightly improved.\"\r\n\r\nThis all boils down to the advice that Simon
    and hrant gave; for a better comparison, use the Cleartype fonts. What you really
    don't like about Verdana on the PC doesn't have much to do with the rendering
    system - you just don't like the TrueType instructions in the font. (I'll make
    no comment on whether I like them - for obvious reasons.)\r\n\r\nJason C"

      fonts \u2026 that would make a strange \u2018comparison\u2019, wouldn\u2019t
      it?   ;-)\"\r\nI know it sounds like a strange idea, but that's because the
      CT fonts have less restrictive TT instructions in them. The point is that to
      evaluate optimal results, use fonts designed to give optimal results for each
      rasterizer. But because of the way tha Mac OS works, it doesn't much matter
      which font you use, there's no such thing as optimal tuning for the Mac.\r\nIt's
      true that if you instead wanted to test pure results, not optimized results,
      you should use fonts with no TT instructions.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective,
      the Mac solution is really the problem. We've got different TrueType font engines
      here, but the Win rasterizer scales and renders type as one would expect from
      reading the TT (OT) specs, while the Mac rasterizer follows most of the TT (OT)
      specs, but virtually ignores a fairly critical section of the spec (Hint Instructions.)\r\nI
      don't want to dredge up the old fight about whether the TT hint instruction
      set was a good idea (for the 12 or so of us who care ;), but technically, the
      Win engine follows the specs more closely, and is truer to a font developer's
      intentions, than the Mac engine.\r\n\r\nHowever that whole idea doesn't affect
      the real quality of display type. Shifts in hardware technology, and sociological
      changes in the way we read and process text over the last 10 years have really
      changed what the \"optimal\" way to render text is. \r\n\r\nI've gotten off
      topic here, but my real comment on the Verdana problems is that the TT instructions
      in the font were designed to specifically work in a 2-bit, black and white rendering
      mode. They suffer more than many other faces in some greyscale rendering situations.\r\n\r\nJason
