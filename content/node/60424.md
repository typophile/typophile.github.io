    for showing passion, you'll need to feel yourself if it communicate passion to
    you."

    handwriting and thus shows more actual restraint than passion.

  body: "Please write this by hand. Your writing will feel better in both content
    (edit, edit, edit) and form.\r\n\r\nPoetry should always be hand written. It may
    be transposed later into digital to be mass-produced, but the creation should
    be personal.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of offending almost everyone here (not much risk
    unless you're new), there is not much that is passionate about fonts except the
    conception and r&d of such fonts. Once they are put on paper by a font \"user\"
    they might be great design, many other wonderful things, but passionate and intimate
    is not the first thing that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nLet the tirades begin.\r\n\r\npbc"

    of using their own handwriting. \"If I <em>could</em> handwrite this, it would
    look like <em>this</em>...\"\r\n\r\nOtherwise, what Paul and Nick said.\r\n\r\nIf
    it's just \"I'm a bit ashamed of my handwriting, it's kinda sloppy\", then practice.
    So am I; mine's appalling. Perhaps print some tests of whichever of these fonts
    you like, find a good pen, and try copying them. Exact slavish reproduction won't
    be the point, but getting a feel for well-shaped lettering will be. Think of the
    patience to spend a lot of time on it as one facet of the passion you want it
    to express...\r\n\r\n[Yikes, that sounded cheesy. You know what I mean...]\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver

    pen on pink paper and add some glittery sprinkles and a dab of scent.
