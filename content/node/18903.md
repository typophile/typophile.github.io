  other thread</a>, here's a sample of my 60s-inspired ligature-heavy typeface which
  i'm sure is going to be a bastard to kern when that time comes. please note that
  i'm only in the early stages of creating ligatures so the end result may look very
  different from this sample.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typesample.png]"

    from which your inspiration came?"

  body: "Hi Claes.\r\nI think it looks good - it does have reference to Ed Interlock
    and others, but these days what doesn't have a link to others? I think the S is
    a little harsh and needs a bit of fun injected - maybe you don't need the down
    strokes - might look better to have them running horizontal. The other letters
    seem to have a kind of \"wacky\" feel to them which is great, but the S kind of
    lacks that and looks a bit like the Apple system font Chicago.\r\nJust my 2 cents.
    Otherwise she's a beauty."

  body: "hail,\r\n\r\nyou're right about the S's being a bit stiff.. i don't think
    they would work without the down strokes though, since several other characters
    have them (C, G).. and it'd make them look a bit thin too. there are definitely
    other ways to make them more playful and less Chicago though, so thanks for the
    comment."

  body: In some cases I would disagree. Sometimes you can overthink the design. In
    this instance it is supposed to be imperfect and spontaneous. If you start over-analyzing
    you'll lose the spirit.

  body: 'the challenge (which i''m currently facing) is just that: keeping it spontaneous
    and imperfect. and to achieve that, find what ligatures to make/use and what to
    stay away from (even if they''d make great usable ligatures). as i''ve noticed,
    a font like this could have a near-infinite number of ligatures, but i highly
    doubt more would make it look better.. the more definitely won''t be the merrier.
    i certainly have a massive task ahead of me.'

  body: Very impressive. I just finished the ligatures for an interlocking font of
    my own, which I call [[http://wat.midco.net/jvipond/miscellany/displayfont.html|Vipond
    Flare]], but I'm not sure how to set up OpenType automatic ligatures.
