  body: "That is none other than the  hand-lettering of [[William Addison Dwiggins]].
    Often imitated, never repeated. :^) In fact, the entire title and all illustration
    is hand-drawn by Dwiggins. But, the words in the body are using his typeface <a

    might find something close in the <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/products/gallery.aspx?gallery=213\">Bluemlein
