  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all,

I want to become more knowledgable with color names. Eg. Instead of orange I'd love to be able to pickout and know what shade of orange, coral is for example.

I have an Iphone app by Pantone colorastrology but its more of a random color calendar and makes it hard to study.

Love to be able to get my hands on a book or website that shows the names in some detail of color on a color wheel or something like it etc

Any help would be great

PS. I've been told that the book Interaction of Color by Josef Albers is one of the must have books when it comes to color. Not sure if it covers the naming of color etc what I am after, any other recommendations links would be appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For an artist, names of pigments work quite well as reliable bench marks. Zinc White is the colour of zinc oxide and thalo blue is the colour of Pathalocyanine. There is no ambiguity because one is referring to colours of pigments that remain consistent all the time. 

But in the design world, names of colours, such a coral are too ambiguous and subjective to be useful. There is no common benchmark for what they mean. As a matter of interest, different suppliers of materials for the sign industry have the same or similar names for some very different colours. One company's sunflower yellow is Pantone 116, another's is close to Pantone 130 which is more orange than yellow. You can never specify a colour by a descriptive name, you always have to use an industry standard such as Pantone, hexidecimal, RBG or CMYK values. My sky blue could be your tropical blue, but Pantone 299 is always Pantone 299. 

I'm sure the Pantone site will have some resources, but here are some sites I've bookmarked to play around with:
.. <a href=http://www.cbu.edu/~jvarrian/applets/color1/colors_g.htm> Additive Color Applet by S.Kamikawa.</a> 
.. <a href=http://www.colortools.net/> Colour Tools.net</a>

		<div class="commentbody">Color naming is about as far away as you can get from exact science, which makes it interesting to study on other levels. It's highly culturally specific too. For example the boundary between green and blue differs between different cultures/languages, or the importance of differentiating light and dark blue. And it's interesting to see which hues are attributed their own names while others aren't (German for instance has a commonly used word for a certain very dark gray, <em>anthrazit</em>, which I realized when in Japan other cultures don't have a special word for).

So go ahead and learn color names, but if you want it to be practically useful, stay within <em>one system</em>, and one that makes sense to use in your specific context. 
Just be aware it's going to be one system, arbitrary like all the other ones. No god-becoming involved.</div>

I don't see the harm in asking other design-related questions. There are a lot of graphic designers here who can answer and the thread title is clear enough for people to decide if they want to read. Does it bother anyone else to have non-type questions asked here? Personally it bothers me more when people ask vague questions that aren't properly formulated, but it's fine for me to just skip them.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I wish I could be so positive. The fact is that type design isn't really a pure subset of graphic design, and there are many more of them than us (the ones that are both know how to be us). People hang out places, and make them the way they want them. Typophile being so open, it's very easy to imagine it becoming diluted, and eventually useless (at least to us).

If/when Photofonts becomes real, then color discussions might be relevant.

I disagree that color has nothing to do with type. I'd say that designing notan for a pure black text is different that designing notan for some yellow text, and if not the notan then certainly some of the optical effects that come into effect when using light on dark color schemes.

Here's a connection to type:
Leslie Cabarga wrote "Learn Fontlab Fast" and "Logo, Font and Lettering Bible", both highly recommended and respected books amongst typophiles.

Leslie also wrote "Designer's Guide to Color Combinations - 500 Historic and Modern Color Formulas in CMYK" a FANTASTIC look at _real_ color combinations that exist in the real world around us.

But you are correct, this thread should be at least in the "Design" category.</div>

Have been getting sick of watching TV shows where people come on an describe a color like orange and call it coral, and I'm like well I'm a designer why don't I know this!

So I am thinking a big movie poster sized color reference poster near my desk with labelled names might help me to remember.
