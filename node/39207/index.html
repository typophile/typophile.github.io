<p>I&rsquo;ve been work over the last weeks on my typeface. Although not finished I decided to post the Caps in order to get some feedback.
Its based on a &ldquo;old style&rdquo; letters I found on an old Portuguese typographic book.
Any comments or suggestions are, as always, highly appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi António.</p>
<p>My very first impressions:</p>
<p>J looks cut off by the baseline.
K, F, T, Z have very sharp points (might be a problem under not so good printing conditions?).
I find that some characters (e. g. K, H, Y) are heavier than others (i. g. C, G, X).
For example, stems of H are quite bold (H looks heavy next to some other characters – maybe make the right stem a bit lighter?).
There are sort of funny angles in W.
Right serif in U is almost a slab serif (for balance reasons?).
In my eyes, some serifs seem to make for slightly clumsy feet (like in P, Y) and stand in contrast to the strong overall stroke width modulation.</p>
<p>Please understand that this is not a balanced critique (I focussed on what I considered possible problem zones) and that not everything that struck my eye is necessarily a bad thing. I just wrote what came to my mind.</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback.
I already had notice that the sharp points could be a problem in small or not so good printing conditions.
So here are my changes to the original post so everyone can comment 
1-Correct the cut off by the baseline in the J. Build a new one more “familiar” with the rest of the letters&hellip;
2- Remove the sharp points in the K, F, T, Z.
3- Lighter some characters like H  (right stem) and Y.
4- Correct the angles in W.
5- Correct the right serif in U.</p>
<p>Please feel free to add comments to my (in) development work.</p>

You were better off with the earlier K. The two arms don&rsquo;t necessary have to meet at a point, the bottom leg could grow out of the top one.

<p>• Make all the thick strokes the same width (see the K), cuved thick strokes also need more weight.
• Beak terminals and serifs on thin strokes are all to light. Weight them up to match the thick stem serifs (see the I vs C)
• Curves need to be smoother. Its hard to tell in a gif, but the R and P for example seem to have a corner going from straight to curved.
• Y should join lower
• W should be wider and the angles corrected as mentioned.
• The leg of the r feels like it bends to much. The idea is fine, but a little to wavy.</p>
<p>Again: can we see your original source?</p>

Thanks for the feedback.
My original source is the book &ldquo;Breve tratado theorico das letras typograficas, offerecido a Sua Alteza Real O Principe Regente Nosso Senhor&rdquo;
The author is Joaquim Carneiro (1727-1818)
The book can be seen here [[http://purl.pt/257]].(see pictures below)
This was my start point but of course I made some adjustments and corrections.
Feel free to add further comments.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you so much for posting that. Now we can see what is you, and what is Joaquim! It looks like it would be interesting to read this book (and understand it!). Do</p>
<p>This kind of early rational grid-fitting in type design is definitely facinating (such as the Romain Du Roi), though I wouldn&rsquo;t be very excited about using the results for text. It suffers from many of the issues that happen when an engineered approach is applied to letters. Again the thinking is interesting, but the results flawed. For example you can clearly see his Y is based on the X. But that pushes the crotch too high. And the X is made of 2 straight lines. But optically the thin stroke looks broken. The bottom of the Z is too narrow (because it&rsquo;s exactly the same width as the top). Same with the S. F crossbar is too high compared to the E. Likewise, the P too high compared to the R Not to mention the proportions suffer from being crammed into a box. Etc.</p>
<p>Maybe for your purposes, try less fixing and use a straight interpretation as a starting point.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Most of the changes I&rsquo;ve made are in pursuit of harmony. Typeface design involves a good deal of philosophy. So-called &ldquo;humanist&rdquo; philosophy accomodates and encourages anomalies, aberrations, inconsistencies attributable to a human effort eschewing modularity, matching angles and widths, and dogmatic abeyance to the grid. So-called &ldquo;modernist&rdquo; philosophy favors the opposite. The changes I&rsquo;ve made can easily be construed as reductive modernism aimed at modularization. While I dislike modularity and have moved away from it in my own type designs, modularization is to some extent an inescapable function of the desire for harmony.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/evenwidth_4209.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Which phiilosophy, if either, is appropriate for this font? If it had angled stressing, proportional character widths and calligraphic artefacting or finish, the conventional answer would be Go Humanist, let it all hang out baby! But the plot here is vertical stress, even width and a strict synthetic finish. According to conventions in type design, modernism wins. According to convention this is a modernist type, not old style.</p>
<p>Acceptance of conventions in type design is not mandatory. You&rsquo;re at liberty to reject them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any reason to drop the bowl of Y as Randy does. That kind of preference seems to be a personal one&mdash;years ago I had the same preference, but presently I favour Y&rsquo;s that harmonize with X. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m glad Randy made the suggestion as it is no less valid than mine and he has every right to make it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A &ndash; widened. I used a flipped V. Now it looks a tad too wide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C &ndash; overshoot corrected, fixed upper serif.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>D &ndash; narrowed. Why? If you make D wide (enough) the counterspace starts to rival the counterspace of O. Is that really a bad thing? In most fonts the capital O contains the largest counterspace of any letter, and the same can be said for the lowercase o of &ldquo;most fonts&rdquo;. The reason has to do with saliency and cueing value in relation to readability. The large counterspace of an O is thought to have a significant saliency or explicit cueing value that helps the eye / brain reading hardware recognize it as an O. If that&rsquo;s true, a wide D with a cueing value rivaling O might compete with O for recognition. The most visible example of this is Helvetica. Another reason for keeping D narrow is enhanced elegance. Elegance seems to be one of the key characteristics of this font. Wide fat D&rsquo;s look ungainly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E &ndash; extended crossbar fills counterspace, creates more even tone and density. Thickened crossbar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>F &ndash; same plot as E.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G &ndash; overshoot corrected, fixed upper serif.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H &ndash; widened, solves former heaviness problem without narrowing stems. H width now approximates N, increase in harmony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>K &ndash; redesigned so that diagonals harmonize with X.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>L &ndash; narrowed for improved fit with other letters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O &ndash; overshoot corrected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S &ndash; baseline overshoot corrected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>W &ndash; new unit built from two overlapping V&rsquo;s. Diagonal angles harmonize with V and A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Z &ndash; corrected horizontals, serifs replaced with E units.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing to reconsider is J. The thin part looks a bit thick, and it sports the sole ball-end in the caps set. In settings combining the caps with the lowercase the ball end will blend in, but in all caps settings it will stick out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>Keep going with this font. It&rsquo;s been done before, many times over, but it&rsquo;s a good learning opportunity.</p>

<p>A &ndash; extended point.</p>
<p>G &ndash; same plot as E, F, K, H. I like the original G just as much. If there is any point to this move, it modularizes the font and dehumanizes it slightly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks James for the feedback&hellip;and yes your are 100% rigth&hellip;&ldquo;It’s been done before, many times over, but it’s a good learning opportunity&rdquo;&hellip;Thats why I&rsquo;m doing it</p>
<p>So after read carefully all feedbacks (Randy and James) I worked around and made &ldquo;lots&rdquo; of changes/upgrades. Some more visible them others but I will try to explain all:</p>
<p>A — New. Used the flipped V.</p>
<p>E and F — extended and Thickened crossbar fills counterspace. Also reduced the length.</p>
<p>G — fixed upper serif and corrected (up) a little the horizontal</p>
<p>H — widened</p>
<p>J- New. I already presented in inicial posts another J. Does not fit quiet well (the old one).</p>
<p>K- New</p>
<p>Q- I like the phantom Q&hellip;</p>
<p>R- New.</p>
<p>U- correct the curve</p>
<p>W — new. built from two overlapping V’s.</p>
<p>Z and T — corrected horizontals, serifs replaced with L units.</p>
<p>Thanks all again for the feedback.</p>

Q: I don&rsquo;t like the phantom Q :-)
N: upper left serif. It should be a smooth continuation from the diagonal (see James' N)
S: Bottom curve has a lump (both you and James)
A: Looks a little thicker at top than bottom (should be the reverse)
V: Same as the A only flipped
J: It&rsquo;s point should feel similar to the R and Q (maybe a hair thicker)</p>
<p>Finally, where your horizontals go from thin into thick curves (B,D,P,R) there is still a corner. try moving the point to the left and extending the bezier handle to make it smoother.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that most of the advice you&rsquo;re getting are sound type-design principles, but some of it is preference. You&rsquo;ve certainly created a useful set of caps. Much improved compared to your original and also your source. Good work!</p>

<p>New improvements</p>
<p>A and V: Optical correction (a little thiner at top than bottom) 
J: Thin the curved tip of J just a bit. Point similar to Q 
K: Correct the upper right serif
N: Correct the diagonal in order to have a smooth continuation in the upper left serif.
P: lower now
R: Remove the inner curve from the middle out curve
S: Corrected</p>
<p>I also noticed (for a while&hellip;) That the size from the top counter in letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; has the same height as the bottom counter. I know that usually there is a &ldquo;optical&rdquo; need for a small counter on top. But like Randy, I like the proportions of that B!</p>
<p>Finally, I tryed to correct (remove the corner) the horizontals that go from thin into thick curves (B,D,P,R). Look better now.</p>
<p>Randy/james,
I&rsquo;m please to see the improvements compared with my first post and also from my source (if he had the help from Typophile&hellip;:-)), thanks for the comments and support!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Quite so Randy&mdash;the phantom Q is not for everyone. I only recommend it as an alternate Q. António can you make a Phantom Q with a gap on just one side of the tail? say the top one only, leaving the bottom part sealed. That might look better.</p>
<p>D looks perfick meow! You&rsquo;ve hit the <em>sweet spot</em>.</p>
<p>If I was preparing this font for retail sale these are the changes I would make:</p>
<p>J &ndash;  default = lining (not dropped), alt J = dropped</p>
<p>K &ndash; integrate the arm angles better</p>
<p>Q &ndash; default = regular unit, alt Q = phantom</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>X: The thin stroke needs to be broken and moved apart. I posted something about this a few years back, but couldn&rsquo;t find it when I searched. Here is a fresh image showing the optical illusion in the X:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/x_ordeal_6428.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Y: The crotch looks off. I think it&rsquo;s because the diagonal thick stroke is too narrow, or tapers too much. The point is too far left, so it doesn&rsquo;t look like the thick strokes join smoothly.</p>
<p>Q: Phantoms aside, I think the underlying form is one of the key &ldquo;features&rdquo; of your source material, and I think you&rsquo;ve treated it well. I happen to not like it though :-) The tail feels like an appology. Like the rest of the oddities in your source, I think it comes from too rational of an approach. Just a comment, no advice here.</p>

<p>New improvements</p>
<p>J- One default = lining (not dropped) and another alt J = dropped. Not sure about this one: I think that the lining will look always smaller them the rest of the letters.
K- Built 2 new. Still not very happy
Q- Built 2 new. One with a Phantom Q with a gap on just the top side of the tail as suggested by James.
Still love the first one and as Randy said is one of the “features” that stands out from my source material.
Y- Corrected the crotch off. Now the diagonal thick stroke is &ldquo;link&rdquo; to the thick strokes (join more smoothly).
X- fixed the optical crossover illusion</p>

		<div class="commentbody">i had the same problem James describes. The upper and lower case seem to be two different things altogether, needing different envisioning and following different rules. I did think it was jhust me though :)
The uppercase looks great! My preference would be a larger lower bowl on the B and fiddle with the K some more&hellip;but perhaps that would throw out the balance with other letters.
I like the non-round shapes of the lowercase counters.
I like the original y in the source scan with that little ball on the end. the s there looks unusual! 
Why does the alphabet end with x, z and y?
Why do you call the Q a phantom?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Ben : ) It is possbile to build a font using a consistent set of rules for upper and lower case. I made one such font and realized the solution required a reductive design. Other type designers discovered the same thing long before I was born, and the general consensus is that reductive design is a <em>cul de sac</em>&mdash;the types are consistent, and efficient, but not much fun compared to designs in which the lower case preserves pen-derived rules of construction. People desire idiosyncracy but thrive on eccentricity in the same breath.</p>
<p>I think x, y, and z wound up at the end because they&rsquo;re the least-used letters. A bit like Google and the internet, the pecking order is based on relevance.</p>
<p>I call the gapped Q a &ldquo;phantom&rdquo; letter because part of the structure isn&rsquo;t there, or is not shown, but spectators infer the missing parts from experience of complete examples. I borrowed the term from anatomy / medicine, where amputated limbs are called phantom limbs because 1) they used to be there, 2) amputees experience a &ldquo;phantom limb effect&rdquo;, percieving the missing limb to be there, much like seeing a ghost. This Q isn&rsquo;t a particularly strong example of a phantom glyph. A better example is a P with the stem section between the bowl removed, or an N with one stem removed. Aldo Novarese designed a typeface featuring a large number of phantom letters&mdash;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stop/" target="_new">Stop</a>. Disappointing that page at Myfonts has no description of Stop. I should talk Laurence Penny into letting me write one for them, it&rsquo;s such a significant face.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I also found that the numbers need separate ideas, not just following the structures of letters. Probably more so than the differences between upper and lowercase. 
I meant really that the original scan here had not x, y, z but x, z then y. Maybe just visually more interesting than x, y, z. 
I know Stop, which i initially thought was exciting, but seems to be used rather badly on the whole. I&rsquo;ve seen &lsquo;phantom&rsquo; ampersands or dollar signs in other fonts too. :)</div>

<p>That&rsquo;s different. You could be right. One way of developing this font as a commercial product would be to make a set of smallcaps to help it appeal to more tastes.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback. And now I want to give my feedback to yours feedbacks&hellip;.</p>
<p>1- James is rigth. This is a learning experience in type design. Of course that if I can make it a commercial product I will. For that I need to see its &ldquo;value&rdquo; at the end. Again James is rigth when he says that a set of smallcaps will help it &ldquo;appeal to more tastes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>2- Like stated before my source is a old typographic book. Again and again I think james is rigth: the order for the x, z, and y its because they’re the least used letters- We dont use Y in Portuguese words!</p>
<p>3- The caps (at the end) are quiet diferent from the caps at the beginning. I think I will do the same &ldquo;learning curve&rdquo; for the lowercaps and the results will be much more interestings that the first one!</p>
<p>I will &ldquo;study&rdquo; all sugestions and do a re-design. Stay tunned&hellip;
Thanks all for the support!</p>
<p>António</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yay! I found it&hellip;some error yesterday. I think I&rsquo;m going to do the same as James and leave it to you for a bit, so I don&rsquo;t interfere with the specific pictures in your head. That italic is especially elegant. 
With the roman&hellip;
I think you need some overshoot on the round shapes, and the space width can be much less (I think I read it can be the same width as the &lsquo;i&rsquo;). The thin strokes look slightly different weights (comparing the r and y, or c and s). They don&rsquo;t need to be exactly the same, though :)
The word &lsquo;barnaby&rsquo; looks very nice!
Keep on going!!</div>

<p>New improvements on the roman!</p>
<p>I have a question to all:
should or should not the m be produced from 2x n?
Helvetica is not but minion it is!
Is any &ldquo;rule&rdquo; about this?
Thanks again for the feedback!</p>

<p>I personally like the charming irregularities in your first capital versions. (PORTUGAL)
Minors are charming and Italic definitely!
Seems that someone (like me;-) likes Bodonis early works.
Have you been to the museum at Parma?</p>
<p>Comments seem very useful,
yet, try to keep something of the original charme you put in your letters, too!</p>
<p>To me its clear that there is a lot of sun in your heart, if I may say so ;-)
minor a is beautiful. The inclined g, too.</p>
<p>Keep on, good feeling in your type!</p>

<p>Sorry for missing your questions. I will try to awnser now:</p>
<p>Yes I did born in 1974.
I think I was one day in Parma in 2001 in a trip to Italy, but did not visit the museum&hellip;
As I said above my original source is the book “Breve tratado theorico das letras typograficas, offerecido a Sua Alteza Real O Principe Regente Nosso Senhor”
The author is Joaquim Carneiro (1727-1818). Did not &ldquo;used&rdquo; Bodini inspiration&hellip;:-)
I&rsquo;m pretty sure that still need some work but I&rsquo;m enjoing the path&hellip;</p>

<p>How is it living in Porto?
Is it worth investing some money for a place to stay?
I am terribly missing the sun and the old walls with fading yellow colors on it.
Desperate.</p>

<p>Why isn’t there anymore the „attach image“ link?

Well, don&rsquo;t know exactlly what you mean by &ldquo;investing some money for a place to stay&rdquo;. If its a place to spend some vacations its nice. We have been with sun this last 2 week but usually in winter here is cold and rain (perhaps not that cold as Hamburg :-))</p>

<p>The tail of the &ldquo;g&rdquo; is a little to the left, not centerd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;bdpq&rdquo; are not totaly rounded, they are kind of rough, is this on porpous?</p>
<p>&ldquo;e&rdquo; is too wide and kind of light</p>
