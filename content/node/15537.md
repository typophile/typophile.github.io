    is completely constructed, not a typeface.

    body: yeah. i guess they took out the lower strokes and made the W kind of funky.

  body: Interesting. The 'w' could have been made by merging two 'v's together. Nice
    idea.

    body: i think you're right, trade gothic looks the closest and indeed, the "w"
      looks like two v overlapping. good point.

    action?

      available types!

  body: "Kathleen is absolutely correct. (BTW -- hi Kathleen, long time, no talk)\r\n\r\nMasthead
    has mistakenly been used so often instead of the correct terms of <em>nameplate</em>
    or <em>flag</em> that it has taken over through common misuse.\r\n\r\nMany years
    ago I worked for two newspaper publishers, <em>masthead</em> ONLY referred to
    the section that carried the name of the publisher, chief staff and place of publication.\r\n\r\nI
    guess it's the same way that FONT has now become what we called <em>typeface</em>."

  body: But maybe it took over because the word is so appropriate for the thing. "Mast"
    (standard bearer) "head" (top, headline).

  body: Well, language is supposed to be a dynamic thing, innit? I've known other
    instances where through continuous popular misuse certain words or definitions
    became acceptable and made it into the dictionary. Now that I know I will try
    to remember and use the correct term, but we'll have to wait and see what the
    future brings.
