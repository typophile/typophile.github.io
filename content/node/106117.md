body: I have had this font before and can not remember the name.  It is pretty much
  just like Mister Sirloin but has the decorative pieces with it.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-7_3767.jpg]

  body: I'm willing to bet that it is "Mister Sirloin BTN Well" with heavy graphic
    design distressing and letter positioning applied to it. The "Y" was altered to
    fill in the "LL" negative space.
