  body: "who to send them to? <-- nearest (small or medium) design studio that you
    think worth sending.\r\n\r\nwhat to say? <-- that you live around the neighborhood
    and interested to gain experience through them. do some research about things
    they've accomplished and if you're amazed by their works/reputation, tell them.\r\n\r\nwhat
    not to say? <-- lies.\r\n\r\nsend resume? <-- offer it, and send if they ask.\r\n\r\nwhat
    to do when they just say thanks? <-- depends, if they're asking for the resume
    that you offered, that's good. if it's just plain 'thanks' then that's not so
    good. IMHO.\r\n\r\nGood luck. :D"

    thanks.\r\n\r\n<ul>Do I respond to the thanks?</ul>  I say no, but what do you
    think.  No questions, no offers int the emails, but they did bother to say thank
    you.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think the same as russell... I don't know what your original post said about
    the mailers and who you sent them to, but perhaps you should follow up by calling
    the ones who responded and set up a meeting or interview. The ultimate point of
    the self-promo is to generate some work or business, no? :-)
