  Times but the qualifications need to be: \"similar\" to Times: traditional serif,
  classic, high legibility.\r\n\r\nIt is an social science thesis, but it deals with
  more technical climate issues as well, so it can't be too playful. Italics are a
  must. \r\n\r\nBuilt-in fonts on Mac OS X:\r\nBaskerville, Hoefler Text, Palatino,
  Times (&NR),  Georgia, Garamond (not as tall as Adobe Garamond or other cuts)\r\n\r\nFreeware
  fonts I like:\r\nBergamo. Day Roman (italics and bold then in Garamond), Lido, Efont

  of the presented I think I <strong>Calluna</strong> most, but would it be suitable
  for a thesis?\r\n\r\n<li>Which of these fonts provides the best balance between
  seriousness, legibility and a warmer touch? How does it work in a long printed text?\r\n<li>
  Do you think I should rule out a font with Old Style Figures? I will have a lot
  of quotes (Harvard System, 1984 p.999) within the text body. I prefer proportional
  Lining Figures.\r\n<li> Which sans (neo-grotestk or humansit) would go with the
  serif you suggest? I have the system fonts (Helvetica, Geneva, Gill Sans, Futura)
  and some free ones (Aller, Museo, DejaVu Sans, Quicksand, Fontin, Delicious, Segeo
  UI \u2013 MS Frutiger Copy).\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would love to use Sabon or Arno,
  but well... to expensive for me.\r\n\r\nI know this is a somehow tiring question,

  body: "Ok, I would like to change discussion a bit towards another direction. Thank
    you so much for your input here, I think I will look for a first typeface to buy,
    and since this is a special thing, especially with limited funds, I would be interested
    in your input.\r\n\r\nI read the \"Choosing a font for book design?\" thread,
    so I am aware of the fonts there.\r\n\r\nI would prefer a font which was created
    for the digital time already in mind... if that plays a role. Something classic
    looking, easy to ready, serif, but still somehow new, fresh and a bit warm. Serif
    of course.\r\nI need a roman and a italic version, and it shouldn't be too expensive.
    \r\nOpenType would be good, so I can use the Small Caps function of my Wordeditor
    program.\r\nThe font would be needed for longer texts, essays, PDFs (and this
    must be possible with the EULA - sorry MVB Verdigris), basically everything I
    would write and print or distribute otherwise. \r\n\r\nAre there any suggestions
    besides what I would consider so far, which is:\r\n<li>Sabon \u2013 maybe a tad
    to traditional, but very homogeneous in appearance, my favorite Garamond.  \r\n<li>Janson
    Text \u2013 looks good, but is it really well digitalized? After W and Y there
    are big gaps, aren't there?\r\n<li>Minon \u2013 Really like it, has the right
    mix of everything, though maybe a bit to narrow?\r\n<li>Andron \u2013 I like it
    more than Arno ;) :D Though maybe a tad to classic\r\n<li>Eudald News, Edita,
    Whitman, Farnham \u2013 Anybody any experience with it? How do they compare with
    Minon and Janson? Would be interested in all these rather new fonts.\r\n\r\nBasically
    I guess I would be looking for something in between Minion and Janson, if that
    makes sense. I like about Minion that the letters seem all to match very nicely,
    everything flows into each other, the x-height is somehow right, but it looks
    a bit to dark maybe and to narrow. \r\nJanson looks quite nice, somehow it is
    not a too far strech from Sabon for my eyes (don't know about their tradition),
    but less old-school. However I feel that with Janson Text the relationship of
    the space between the letters are not really perfect.\r\n\r\nI hope you see what
    I would be looking for?\r\nAnd any experience with the latter four would be interesting
    to hear.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    triggered due to Arabic/Byzantine influence in Europe with Islamic scholars studying
    the ancient Greek and Latin philosophers and continental Europeans rediscovered
    them due to this influence. So maybe Arno is not too off after all ;)"

    me to make up my mind. I had tried Warnock before, there is a book by Hamid Dabashi
    \"Iran, a people interrupted\" which looked great on Warnock, but when printed
    I guess paper and printer I used (average laser + a4 paper) didn't make a good
    impression. My two other options, Minion and Sabon, though great, didn't look
    as sharp (if that's the proper typographical term). I was one in love with Sabon,
    but now it seems rather cozy, too \"round\", and Minion looks a bit \"squared\".
    By contrast, the \"coldness\" of the sharp and slim forms of Arno, perhaps due
    to the fact that it was based on handwriting (a mix of Brioso and Minion), somehow
    makes me remember swords or metalblades, which is great, specially my subject(s)."

  body: "@ ycherem:\r\nIt is not really established in general knowledge how big the
    influence of the near&middle east area was during the middle ages for Europe.
    In math to medicine to philosophy there was a lot of research and a rich culture
    of literature, while in Europe a lot of knowledge was not lost bot somehow sleeping
    and it was a lot due to this influence that Europe started off again. No wonder
    the Renaissance draws on the antique, because this was exactly the knowledge brought
    back from Byzantine to Europe.  \r\n\r\n@ Andres:\r\nSound like a good idea, let's
    see. \r\n\r\nSince you say for you as a type designer it is interesting what the
    type loving customers think I will tell my criteria in this special search. \r\n\r\nI
    was mostly comparing the overall look of the textbody and how easy it is to cut
    through the text. The individual shapes matter in so far, as they contribute to
    a round and harmonic image of the textbody and are in balance with the other ones
    and of course as well look somehow nice by themselves. But I didn't inspect any
    letter close up or anything.\r\n\r\nIf anybody is interested in my totally amateurish
    thoughts on individual fonts:\r\n\r\n<li> Minion: close to perfect, a bit to narrow,
    dense, and it could be a bit rounder, but I would like to have this font later.
    Great to read.\r\n<li> Sabon: Totally different from Minion, but as well almost
    perfect, coming form the other, the softer side. This font made me fall in love
    with type though and I think is one of the most beautiful fonts and the best Garamond.
    I am not sure if the spaces between letters is always balanced, maybe SabonNext
    is better here.\r\n<li> Andron: I think it is somehow between (rounder than) Minion
    and (less traditional maybe... than) Arno and I like it better than Arno. It is
    less dark, a bit milder, looks very nice and sophisticated, should definitely
    be a serious consideration. Maybe update the website or make a parallel international
    one, just focus on the font? I like the sites of <a href=\"http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/index.html\">Jos</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.type-together.com/index.php\">type together</a> a lot.
    Maybe they are to \"pop\" for Andron, but I hope this font gains more recognition.
    A free roman font is a good thing. :)\r\n<li> Calluna: I like it a lot, it is
    sweet and modern, somehow a bit radical and still graceful. I think Jos Buivenga
    produces good typos like crazy ;)\r\n<li> I like as well Baskerville and Hoefler
    Text, but those coming with mac are for my purposes either to limited (I need
    OSF and LF) or are not the best cuts for body text, in my personal opinion. A
    closer look on Whitman and Eudald News might be interesting. \r\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\r\nAlright,
    so much about it. I an overview table might follow. :)\r\n\r\n"

    able to do. Calluna is beautiful as well, not far away actually from Cycles. One
    thing I notice about Calluna is that the top curves of round small letters (a,
    b, c, e, g, h, m, n, o, p, r) is very similar and regular, which is even more
    obvious because of the \"direction\" Jos put there. This is not a good or bad
    thing, I don't know, I guess it has two effects: the image of the text becomes
    more homogenic, but maybe there is less for the eye to hold onto. I don't know,
    was just an interesting observation for me. Anyhow I think the comparison to Cycles
    shows that Calluna is a very high quality font. As the comparison Andron/Arno
    gives a similar results about Andron. \r\n\r\nAt least for my unprofessional eye.
