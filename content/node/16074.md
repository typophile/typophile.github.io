body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nI have been designing for a few years now and have recently started
  using InDesign CS2 which from what I know about it is a great program, with a lot
  of untapped potential. \r\nI really want to get to know this program thoroughly
  but am restricted in the jobs I have been working on. \r\nI have always have a love
  and I feel an eye for typography and sensibilities of type but feel slightly restricted
  in what I know about this program. \r\nI am after adivce from anyone on great ways
  to learn InDesign, to work in it as quickly and proficiently as possible. \r\nMaybe
  if I had a project like say and annual report I would get a good grasp on things
  because I have to but at the moment I have basically been working on ads and low
  page number documents. \r\nI hope I have made some sense hear. I really want to
  take this program seriously as I think it is the major tool in \r\nmy career as
  a designer. \r\nI would love to here anyones experienced advice or anything that
  they think may help. I am in Australia if anyone knows of great short courses etc.
  \r\n"

    answer.\r\nIf you have your own projects in that area, it can be useful when your
    boss expects you to work OT on his/her pet charity, for free, and you can respectfully
    decline."

    John is right on the right places to start, but be aware you can alonely just
    begin to learn about this program

  body: "The best book I've seen for getting up to speed on using InDesign as a production
    tool is Olav Kvern & David Blatner's <cite>Real World InDesign CS</cite>. It's
    missing the new features in CS 2, but its emphasis on real-world use has been
    invaluable for me. Its chapter on InDesign's typographical features is short but
    thorough, and that, at least, hasn't changed much between the last two versions.\r\n\r\nIt
    also explains how to design long-form documents in InDesign, but be warned --
    although InDesign is better for designing books than Quark XPress (he said understatedly),
    it's not as powerful as the old FrameMaker or Ventura Publisher were. There are
    aspects of dealing with books that are pretty unwieldy in InDesign.\r\n"

  body: "I have been using InDesign CS for over a year now, and just recently switched
    to CS2. I feel I know the text aspects quite well, but I simply haven't touched
    images and nifty design stuff. \r\n\r\nI started by converting a 24 page saddlestitch
    book into ID, fiddled with headers and subheaders, etc, then created some pamphlets.
    Probably real hack jobs, but good for learning. I now edit a 600 page course calendar
    in InDesign. Frustrating and tedious at times, but that's just the learning process,
    and it has been well worth the effort. \r\n\r\nGive yourself a project to do in
    your off time -- replicate the layout of a book you like using the fill feature
    to create lots of text, and then manipulate. Or find a writer friend and get them
    to let you layout a story or novella of theirs.\r\n\r\nThe only way you're going
    to figure out how the program works is by trying to do specific things with it,
    but that's my opinion. You can \"know\" the functions, but will not be able to
    work efficiently until you've used them a few times. \r\n\r\nI found following
    the sample \"projects\" in books not very helpful, but then, the examples were
    never geared to the kinds of problems I was having or the work I was doing. I
    do have a copy of Real World, and refer to it when I'm stuck, but I also find
    the help menu handy, as well as the Adobe online forums. Generally, I learn best
    by beating my head against a wall until it clicks. (Just something I enjoy, I
    guess.)   \r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\nKristina"
