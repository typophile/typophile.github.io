body: "I'm curious what most folks here think about \"fake italics\" on the web, the
  slanted rendering of non-italic faces when viewed in web pages.  This occurs when
  font families lacking italic faces are used in a webpage.  Common fonts such as
  Tahoma are like this, even Helvetica under Mac OS X 10.4: \r\n<code>\r\n  font-family:
  Tahoma, Helvetica;\r\n  font-style: italic;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nBrowsers are forced
  to do this for backwards compatibility but it seems like it would be nice to have
  a way of signaling \"no fake italic dammit!\" so that the browser would either use
  a non-italic face or fall back to a font family with a real italic face.\r\n\r\nSame
  holds true for fake bolding."

  body: "Depends on the typeface and the rendering technology. At 10px a well-hinted
    fake italic might work better than a true italic of a different font.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I don't think it would be a good idea to do a fallback to the regular style or
    a different typeface. "

    primary typeface, and assign italics to certain passages, then you\u2019ll get
    Tahoma Fake Italic \u2013 of course.\r\nIn consequence: If you want true italics,
    don\u2019t specify Tahoma. Period."
