  body: "Definitely feasible to use ausprobe [provided you solve any copyright issues
    with the designer] as a basis for editing if you can't find the precise font in
    janet. Here is a test slanted 24.5% left & horiz comp 80%.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/janetquicktest_5293.jpg]\r\nDon"
