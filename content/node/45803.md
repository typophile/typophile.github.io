    coming to ATypI in St Petersburg this year? Registration and program info will

    hours content fitting in 60 minutes, as Rich Roat did was at the border of collapsing

    to the other ... but perhaps we''ll get it next time!'

    is that you love type. Or (in the case of spouses, I guess) be willing to hang

    who had designed one font and didn\u2019t even have a specimen because my laptop
    had been stolen and it took me a few weeks to find it in my screwed-up backup
    archive. Everyone was friendly, people had tons of suggestions for my senior thesis,
    and I learned so much that I felt like I was on speed for the next three months.\r\n\r\n<cite>I
