  for LETTERPRESS / FOIL cards.\r\n\r\nWould you prefer extra thick cards, for instance
  Colorplan 540/700gsm - or do you think the \u2018standard\u2019 thickness of 300-400gsm
  as commonly supplied by all the online digital and litho printers (Vistaprint etc)
  is thick enough and that the \u201Cletterpress effect\u201D (debossing/impression)
  is sufficient to make your card stand out from the crowd?\r\n\r\nI\u2019d be very
  interested to hear your thoughts on this :)\r\n\r\n- David"

    Standard US business cards are 110# to 130# cover stock (equivalent to 300-350
    gsm). For normal letterpress printing this should be sufficient. For foil stamping
    I might prefer the 540-700 gsm (in the US, a 200#-250# cover, or duplex) stock.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, a 540-700 gsm stock will stand out from the crowd just by virtue of its
    heft, even if it's printed digitally or offset."

    for letterpressed cards, 300 gsm is plenty thick, unless you're punching the type
    really hard on both sides. But thicker could work. You might even print on binder's
    board if you want something really thick."

      nice - and I'm personally not a big fan of the excessive impression style.\r\n\r\nBut
      if it's only 'standard' thickness and light impression why go to the extra trouble
      and expense of sourcing letterpress cards? - most people wouldn't notice the
      difference from the cheap digital/litho cards from Vistaprint etc.\r\n\r\nWe
      find nearly all of our letterpress enquiries are for extra thick card - and
      they usually settle for 540g - at this weight even without heavy impression
      it's pretty obvious they aren't cheap/ordinary business cards. We find that
      people who are proud of their profession/business want to have a card that sets
      them apart from the competition.\r\n\r\nKind regards - David\r\n\r\nhttp://www.deeplyimpressed.co.uk/\r\n\r\n"

    be running their fingers over it) even if they don't realize they can see it.
    Just like we still need more text fonts even though laymen can't tell the difference.\r\n\r\nIf
    sensationalism is the only way to make it matter, then it is in fact dead.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>nearly
