    that it had to be Blue Highway. But is difference so noticeable, in that size?
    Does Blue Highway look awful whereas Interstate does not? In that size? I think
    there\u2019s a difference but I wouldn\u2019t call Blue Highway awful unless Interstate
    was at least bad."

  body: "Reason 1: Superwoman sight - dunno 'bout that, although I'm at an age where
    I should need reading glasses and don't yet, knock wood.\r\n\r\nReason 2: I think
    Blue Highway is pretty poor - it looks faux condensed. It is clearly based on
    either Interstate or on Highway Gothic (which I think inspired Interstate as well).\r\n\r\nReason
    3: Interstate is a far more common font. When in doubt, go for the obvious."
