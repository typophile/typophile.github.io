  advertising events etc. fly posted around the city. Many look like they're from
  the same print shop, all use the same collection of fonts (some kind of gothic display
  with various widths and weights, ID please!), and have a kind of faded spectrum
  of colours that looks like it could have been airbrushed/aerosoled? Any info on
  the typeface, print method or other background info would be massively appreciated!\r\nThanks"
