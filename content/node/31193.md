  Majoor has been designing type since the mid-1980s. After a student placement at
  URW in Hamburg, he started in 1986 as a typographic designer in the Research & Development
  department at Oc\xE9-Netherlands. There he carried out research into screen typography
  and worked on the production of digital typefaces for laser printers. \r\n\r\nIn
  1988 he started working as a graphic designer for the Vredenburg Music Centre in
  Utrecht, for whom he designed the typeface Scala for use in their printed matter.
  Two years later FSI FontShop International published [[FF Scala]]\u2122 as the first
  serious text face in the then-new FontFont-Library. In 1993 FF Scala was augmented
  with a sans-serif version, FF Scala Sans, which was also released by FSI. In the
  eyes of the designer the sans and the serif versions complement each other admirably.
  They follow the same principle of form but are two distinct designs. The second
  largest newspaper in Holland (Algemeen Dagblad) used both FF Scala and FF Scala
  Sans for text and headlines and is a good example of how the two families can work
  together. \r\n\r\nIn 1994 Majoor started working on the design of the Dutch telephone
  directory, for which he did both the typography and, more importantly, created a
  new typeface. The face is called Telefont and comes in two weights: Telefont List
  and Telefont Text. The Dutch phone company PTT Telecom holds exclusive rights to
  both fonts. \r\nPerhaps as a reaction to the very formal work on the phone books,
  Majoor designed FF Scala Jewels in 1997, a quartet of classic decorative typefaces
  based on the capitals of FF Scala Bold.\r\n\r\nMajoor\u2019s third major typefamily,
  [[FF Seria]]\u2122 was released in 2000. It consists of a serif version and a sanserif
  versions. In 2001 it was awarded a \"Certificate of Excellence\" from the ISTD International
  TypoGraphic Awards 2001 in London and a \"Certificate of Excellence in Type Design\"
  from the ATypI Type Design Competition \"Bukva:raz!\" in Moscow. In 2006/2007 Majoor
  worked together with Pascal Zoghbi, who designed Sada, the Arabic counterpart for
  Seria. It was published in the book \u2018Typographic Matchmaking\u2019\r\n\r\nThe
  [[FF Nexus]]\u2122 family (2004) has three versions (a serif, a sanserif and a slabserif),
  that are all 'connected'. There is also a typewriter versions and two sets of elegantly
  drawn swash capitals. It was one of FontShops first OpenType\xAE fonts and two years
  later it won the first prize at the Creative Review Type Design Awards 2006, in
  the catagory Text Families.\r\n\r\nMajoor taught typography at several Schools of
  Arts and since 1992 he gave lectures at conferences in Budapest, Antwerp, Paris,
  San Francisco, Barcelona, The Hague, Berlin, Prague, Warsaw and Stockholm. His work
  was exhibited in Rotterdam, New York, Paris, London, Berlin, Capetown, Helsinki,
  Barcelona, Bologna and Ontario. He wrote articles for magazines like Items, 2+3D
  and Eye. He works as a graphic designer and type designer in both The Netherlands
  and Poland.\r\n\r\n<strong>Typefaces</strong>\r\n[[FF Scala]]\r\n[[Telefont]]\r\n[[FF
