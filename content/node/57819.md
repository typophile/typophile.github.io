body: "Hi,\r\nI'm looking for an elegant contemporary sans serif typeface similar
  to [[http://www.type-together.com/Bree|Bree]] but even more decorative with more
  ligatures and swashes to use on an anniversary piece. I looked at [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000269|Los
  Niches]] but found it a bit too quirky. [[http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=6|Estilo's]]
  'swashiness' on Myriad would be something I'm after. I'd appreciate your suggestions."
