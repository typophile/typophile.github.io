  body: "Erhard Kaiser has been in the trade for quite a long time now and sometimes
    this shows up in his designs. The trapping, not always completely consistent,
    has almost become a part of his hand. Therefore it is quite difficult to remove,
    but it does not bother me that much actually, especially considering the overall
    very high quality of Erhard\u2019s designs. There is not much trapping in DTL
    Antares, but perhaps we will suppress it somewhat more before the typeface is
    officially released.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea how meticulously DTL Antares was
    developed, I have placed a small PDF at http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/PDF/Temp/Antares/DTLAntares_develop.pdf.
    It shows for instance the first version, which was rounder with a lower contrast
    and the former and final versions with the high contrast.\r\n"

  body: "Fascinating PDF on the development of the face, thanks.\r\n\r\nMy feeling
    is that the earlier version, more round with less contrast, would be better for
    text, but I am just guessing. The final version is extremely consistent and well
    thought out and beautifully executed. I don't warm to it, though this may be a
    matter of personal taste."

  body: "Insight into font development is always highly welcome - thank you!\r\n\r\nThe
    earlier more round version is indeed more appealing when looking at large glyphs;
    but this is a text face, and I have a strong hunch that the final version is more
    \"true\" to what needed to be done. And this ties in to my view that a true text
    face needs a certain subtle ugliness to really click.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      irregularity. But this is not the main issue here, it seems to me."

  body: "This is really fascinating, Frank. It seems that he had similar problems
    as I did when trying to \"figure out\" a typeface of this construction. It is
    really hard, for instance, to make it seem like certain glyphs don't fall over
    to the left. \r\n\r\nPersonally I think the first version feels more like a text
    face, the high-contrast final version is not as nice. Still hard to tell without
    seeing text blocks of both side-by-side! I found the italics were also very tricky,
    almost unworkable. Still, it is very interesting to see the development, side
    by side, thanks!"

  body: "Prokyon looks like something I'd have done to Gill Sans models ten years
    ago. The difference is these types are very well drawn, but it seems to me such
    radical stylistic choices seriously limit their applicability. \r\nIt seems to
    me they become quickly very tiring on the eye.\r\nThe lc a of the Italic is even
    more problematic than the one in my own Ottomat. It's like the one in Dax Italic.\r\n\r\nI
    say these things because, being DTL releases, I guessed they may have been thought
    as text-aimed. Or are they meant more as display types?\r\n\r\nPlease, Hrant,
    note I used the term \"display types\". I happily see how I've changed (and still
    changing)."
