  find it)...\r\nThe italic is almost definetly Garamond but the regular looks like
  a mix of garamond, hoefler text and plantin even... is it a custom job or is it
  something I missed?\r\n\r\n"

    Font ID Guide. This combination of characteristics is a new one, but the letterforms
    don't look new. That strongly says this is a mixed face to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Download <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue6/henry.htm">this poster</a>
    and check the font info in the PDF -- looks like the font is called HenryFour,
    and it comes in (at least) regular, italic, and small caps weights..

  body: "Well, I have been studying 'HenryFour' and the majority of the Roman letters
    are from Adobe Garamond, in my opinion, or are at least similar enough that I
    personally can't see an obvious difference (I know my eyes aren't as calibrated
    as some of yours). The 'd' and 'u' have distinctively low baseline serifs, and
    the 'k' seems identical. The letters which are NOT Adobe Garamond are (I think)
    the 'a', 'c', 'g', 'j', 's', 'C', 'G', 'P', 'S', 'T', and maybe the 'J'.\r\n\r\nWhere
    do those other letters come from? I think the 'g' looks most like Janson, but
    some of the other letters look like a Caslon Oldstyle. I think at least some of
    the italic letters, such as the 'g' look also like Caslon.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is
    still that HenryFour is a 'Frankenstein's Monster' with borrowed parts, and possibly
    no original design.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
