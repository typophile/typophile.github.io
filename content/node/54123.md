  typeface designed with the rebranding back in 2005, but does anyone know of a digital
  version that exists of the unmodified typeface, or the modified version they're
  using in their logotype? (png attached)\r\n\r\nI'm working on a sponsored student
  project for a packaging course. I could always contact the sponsor, but the CPG
  market is so restrictive, they may not feel comfortable with handing off anything.
  We had to modify the project scope to even allow its use in our portfolios.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n-Ben"
