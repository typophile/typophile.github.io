  March), we're appealing for your help. What we're offering is a\r\nstraight swap
  - you give us your opinions, and we'll give you a free font.\r\n\r\nEveryone who
  completes our survey at http://www.daltonmaag.com/survey will\r\nreceive a 5-user
  licence to a fully-functional demonstration version of\r\nInterFace Regular, our
  most popular font (registration is required to\r\nreceive the font, but as you already
  receive our Infoletter, you're\r\nalready registered with us). Plus, we'll also
  give 10% off any Dalton Maag\r\nExclusive font licences purchased made before the
  end of June 2006.\r\n\r\nDalton Maag Design Team\r\n"

    there any other shops online that carry the Dalton Magg Font Book Collection?
    A couple months ago I was on the verge of buying this but didn't because I am
    a poor student and was in debt, but this reminded me of it and I was just about
    to put in an order to find out I have missed out as it is sold out."

  body: "Bruno,\r\nI just took your survey and have some comments.\r\nThere were some
    parts to the survey which were unclear to me. When you asked about what is legal
    in your country and what you would like to see in a EULA, you said, \u201Cuse
    on all my computers\u201D and \u201Cgive to a service bureau.\u201D\r\nThe problem
    is, you might answer one way if you have only one or two computers (less than
    5) and another if you have dozens. Regarding \u201CGive to a Service Bureau,\u201D
    you might define this as embed in a file for output for your use or actually give
    them the complete set of font files. These are different actions but your questions
    don\u2019t differentiate the possibilities. The answers you get may be far afield
    of your intention.\r\nWould you please clarify?\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Bruno, good idea with the survey.\r\nThe only problem is \"what's legal in
    your country\": besides the\r\nfact the almost nobody really knows, it depends
    on a given EULA\r\nof course. Oh, and you might add \"plain\" to the choices for
    \"what\r\ndo you think of our website\"...  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Guys, thanks for the comments to the survey. We debated the \"what's legal
    in your country\" question here, and are aware of what the EULA says. However,
    what we tried to find out is what users *think* is legal in their place of work
    - in other words their perception of legality. \r\nWhen we ask about giving the
    font to a service bureau, we definitely mean to pass the actual font software,
    not embedding (although that alone could be an entire survey). \r\nThe \"use on
    all my computers\" again refers to a perception that people have about fonts.
    Some people think that if they spend a few Dollars/Euros/Rupees or whatever, they
    actually own the font, thus being able to do with it whatever they like. So, we
    are trying to find out what their thinking is.\r\nThe EULA questions we placed
    into the survey because we are working on changing ours. Our (hopefully honourable)
    intentions are to protect our work but also give the user flexibility in using
    our fonts.\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies some of your thoughts. And thanks for
    participating. I do appreciate your input.\r\n\r\nBruno Maag\r\nDalton Maag Ltd"

  body: "Bruno, you know I am going to ask you for a copy of the answers you get regarding
    the EULA questions, right?\r\n\r\nI agree with Chris, I expected to see something
    about embedding in that question. I would rather be able to embed into PDFs for
    proofs to my clients and final PDFs for the printer/bureau than be able to give
    a copy of the font to the printer/bureau.\r\n\r\n\"Which of the following do you
    think are legal in your country? (Choose all that apply)\"\r\n\r\nThis question
    is quite vague. Do you mean it in regards to your DaMa EULA? I'm not quite sure
    how to answer as so many EULAs see it differently."

  body: "Hi Tiff,\r\n:-), I know!\r\n\r\nYes, maybe we should have put embedding in,
    too. However, as a company Dalton Maag has decided that all our fonts in the future
    will have Editable Embedding permitted. I think URW does the same.\r\n\r\nI know
    the question is vague, but I don't necessarily want you to think of a EULA. We're
    after expectations. You may also find that some parts of EULAs are not even enforcable
    depending on local legislation. We want to find out what people *think* they can
    do, whether they've read the EULA or not, based on their rights/duties in their
    localities. What good is it to bang on about copyright protection if the local
    legislation does not even know the meaning of copyright?\r\n\r\nDoes that explain
    it?\r\n\r\nBruno Maag\r\nDalton Maag Ltd"

    think of it until I was done, but I'd like to have a set. And, I will bug you
    for results later. :^) This is an excellent idea."
