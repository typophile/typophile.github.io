  Thanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Embossed_5538.png]"

    layer and add the blue color and add bevel&emboss/contour to it.\r\n3. Write the
    text (a new layer is automatically created)\r\n4. Rasterize this layer\r\n5. Use
    the wand, mark the type and select the blue layer..\r\n6. ..and hit delete.\r\n\r\nVoilla!"

  body: "If you're using Photoshop, there is an even easier way and it leaves the
    text editable.\r\n\r\nTo mimic this example:\r\n1. Make the background blue\r\n2.
    Add your text in dark gray (as Northbay previously stated, this automatically
    creates a new layer)\r\n3. Add a layer style to the text layer \u2013 Outer Bevel,
    direction down\r\n4. There is no stage four\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily the
    best way, but it's quick.\r\n\r\nThe general rule of thumb is to add a softened
    drop-shadow of the text in a lighter colour to mimic a highlight. You can even
    get an approximation of this effect in CSS (see <a href=\"http://www.reynoldsftw.com/2009/03/text-embossing-technique-with-css/\">here</a>)
    and throughout the iPhone UI, for example.\r\n\r\n My quick example here is:\r\n\u2014Style:
    Outer Bevel\r\n\u2014Technique: Smooth\r\n\u2014Depth: 1%\r\n\u2014Direction:
    Down\r\n\u2014Size: 3 px (this is only a small test image, a higher-res image
    will be different)\r\n\u2014Soften: 5 px (same)\r\n\u2014Angle: 90\xBA\r\n\u2014Highlight
    Opacity: 65%\r\n\u2014Shadow Opacity: 50%\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/outerbevel_4032.jpg]"

    \ //This is just to bring the embossing out.\r\nh1{\r\nfont-size:3em;\r\ncolor:#111;\r\ntext-shadow:0
    0.04em 0.05em rgba(255,255,255,0.6),0 0 0.04em rgba(0,0,0,0.8);\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIt's
    all in the shadows."
