  body: Thanks. Maybe I didn't flare it up enough, but I meant it to be comic-bookish
    with a definite street flava.

  body: "well the \"e\"s and \"a\"s are too light for me. \"x\" probably too but it's
    not within a text block.\r\n\r\nThe ones that seem to heavy are: D and 5.\r\n\r\nI
    normally don't like the back slant, but I guess it goes well with this font. Someone
    else may judge it from this point because my judgement isn't the right one here.\r\n\r\nWhat
    about letter-spacing? Does it seem to tight to me or is there anyone else that
    can confirm this?"
