  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I feel really burnt out at my teaching job & have felt that way for approximately the last year. So, I handed in my resignation, which will become effective at the end of this spring semester. 

My #1 destination is NYC. Since last summer, I've wanted to work there, but it never happened. Despite the economy woes, I feel that it's a good time for me to relocate from CT to NYC. I've heard different opinions from different people; some say that it's a horrible time to move, others say that freelance opportunities are readily available.

Any NYC designers here that care to chime in with their feedback? Would be appreciate!

		<div class="commentbody">I moved here three weeks ago. Temping is just dead. The print/identity job market is terrible; there are still a fair number of interactive and fashion design jobs turning up on a daily basis, mostly mid-level positions. But the competition is tough—one AD told me he got over 300 applications for a job, and it wasn’t the most desirable job. And some jobs are evaporating with the money supply before anybody gets hired—it happened to me just yesterday. The only real upside is that rents are in free-fall; even super-hot Brooklyn rents started crashing in the last few weeks.

Spend a few days watching Craigslist (where most NYC job postings go), Krop, and Coroflot. If you really want to come here, make sure you have a big pile of cash to live on. Don’t sign a lease unless they’ll let you out with no penalty if you get laid off and can’t find work (this is already common in Manhattan). It might even be a good idea to submit a resume/portfolio to temp/headhunting firms for feedback before you come.</div>

I do not think so, cheer up.

James, this is like recommending prospecting for gold, i.e. stupid, but: if you strike it lucky with a font on MyFonts, it will pay the bills for quite a while. My gut feeling right now is right up your alley: display, individualistic, perhaps with even only a few family members. While all sales are down, something like Museo still sells quite a bit. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Fantomas, James Puckett's advice is good. I've been freelancing at NYC ad agencies for 2+ years now, and I've always been able to find gigs... until now. I've even heard of studio managers and art directors being laid off. Agencies are merging studios to cut costs. That doesn't mean there aren't any opportunities, but as James said, if you send in your résumé, there will be at least 300 other résumés being sent in, too.

I agree with jackson -- you'll probably find more opportunities here, in spite of the crisis. Just make sure you have some spare $$$, in case it takes a while to find a job.</div>

• The world is full of people who like blinking lights, motion, fades, and low-end video games. And that’s what those people are willing to pay for.
• Designers get stuck in the “I don’t do code” mindset and use Flash for all of their small projects.

that does sound nice... as long as all your visitors have enough patience to wait for your slow, slow flash site to load.

More relevantly, though, 2 of my roommates who are photographers are extra busy with freelance work lately, I guess because all the companies laid off their in-house photographers and need someone to do the work...so I don't know if that also goes for design freelancers or not, but maybe?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On a related note, are all the short-term unpaid internships I see in NYC design job listings normal? Or are they just misers exploiting the unemployed young designers out there? I’ve seen hundreds of internships that require print and web experience, sometimes even expecting the intern to provide a computer and software, and they run as short as two weeks and no more than six. I’ve even seen some very specific production internships that are only for a night, just to get a project out. Please tell me that this isn’t normal and that the local design schools teach the kids not to work for people who are too stingy to hire freelancers or production staff. In DC even the really crooked “nonprofit” lobbying organizations didn’t try to pull the stuff I see going on with New York internships.</div>

Just realize the challenge involved in having steady bills while the pay might not be as consistant. The fact that you are moving to a new city throws another element into the equation. 

Not to discourage though. My advice would be to FIND PEOPLE wherever you are. People know people who now people. People can be clients or friends of future clients. Who knows? The fact that you are reaching out to designers for advice on this forum is definitely a good start. Sorry I've not addressed your concerns about NYC (I live in Seattle).</div>

I've seen how this works. I submitted to HR that we needed a competent UI graphic designer for web. What comes out the other end is Flash, PHP, Bachelor's Degree, Javascript, etc. Not a mention of UI, which is actually a harder specialty to find than the others. I ended up posting the real job to Craigslist myself because the people we were interviewing were everything we already had, but not what we needed.

RE: Wordpress
I'm a web designer who does a lot of Wordpress development, and I'm always looking for side gigs. If you hand me a finished Photoshop mockup, I could have you a decent theme done up real quick like. You help me finish up some of my fonts, and I'd do it for free and host it even.

These days, though, Flash is an IDE with it's own language and can be leveraged in some amazing ways. 

Most visual design gigs that ask for flash experience, are more likely looking for someone that understands what can and can't be done with it, and want someone that can do UX design with that in mind, but who will be passing the production on to dedicated Flash developers.

That and there's always the HR job descriptions that want someone with 10 years of graphic design, COBOL programming, oracle db optimization skills, and who can bat .350.</div>

I'm not so sure that this applies to design freelancers, Gillian.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Nikita

I sympathise with moving out of the teaching job (I gave mine up midway through last year), but you'll need a considerable budget to start up in a new town as a freelancer – whether you go direct or via agencies. 

I'm nowhere near NYC, but even in these backwaters people are taking advantage of the situation to post job specs that are quite unrealistic in their expectation (i.e. all rounder intermediate designer with print & web experience for US$20k p/a ??!!). The advice to post resumes/make connections/market yourself in advance is all good, but the reality is that the gravy days of freelancing are long gone. The saner option might be to lessen your expenditure, stay put and carefully restock your burnt-out creative cupboard.</div>

you're a grumpy old man, aren't you?         :+)

_crooks_ are "the cause of this mess" --
criminals who weaseled their thumbs onto
the buttons of the financial control panel...

it has nothing to do with pleasure-seeking.

(the wrong-doers are chronically unhappy;
their greed _never_ lets them feel satisfied,
regardless of how much they already have;
that's why they ran the ship into the ground.
and why they'll run it into the ground again,
unless we put them where they can't hurt us.)

you're wrong.  totally.  completely.  dead-wrong.

that 700-billion-dollar "mountain of debt"
that we find directly in our path today was
most certainly produced by _criminals_,
although they might never be _charged_...

but they knew full well what they were doing,
and they knew full well that it was _wrong_,
as in _immoral_, as in _destructive_to_society_.

those "financial institutions" that gave out loans for 
$200,000 homes to people making $2000 a month?

if they'd done it once or twice, it'd be "a mistake".
but they did it thousands and thousands of times...
do you think it was "an accident"?  it was a _crime_.

they knew from the get-go that those were bad loans.

they knew -- with full certainty -- that there would be
foreclosures eventually.  but they didn't care, because
it just meant they'd be the owners of an empty home,
so they could loan money to new people to "buy" it...

besides, it helped pay off the loans they'd made to the
developer companies, and the builders and contractors.
the "financial institutions" made money at every level!

moreover, it fed the misleading notion that that house
was _worth_ $200,000, because look, somebody had
"bought" it for that price, even though -- as the banks
and the builders knew full well -- it only cost $80,000
to _build_ the darn thing.  they rolled in "surplus" profit.
it's obscene, and everyone on the inside was aware of it.

they _knew_ what they were doing, they knew _exactly_.

nor did it stop there...

because when they bundled a bag of the bad loans to
sell to other "financial institutions", at inflated prices,
they knew exactly what they were doing, yes they did.

and the "financial institutions" which _bought_ them,
and then turned around and sold them to someone else,
at higher prices, knew exactly what they were doing too!

this little trick was straight out of the savings-and-loan
"scandal" from a couple decades ago, and it worked again.

everyone knew, and as long as everyone just kept passing
the bags along, always at a higher price than they'd paid,
so they could extract their commission, they were happy.

and that's criminal.  certainly immoral.  and despicable.

but it got even worse...

they knew that if they grew the cost of the bags enough,
they'd become "too big to fail" -- they even coined a cute
slogan to drive the point home! -- and the _government_
would come in with a "rescue" plan -- i.e., more money! --
and then they would slurp off some of _that_ big fund...

yep, they knew who'd end up "holding the bag" in the end!

you see, they remembered that too from the s&l "scandal".

and their gall is astounding!  $700 billion!  unbelievable!
who could even conceive of such a huge amount of money!
heck, g.m. had to work up nerve to ask for just $25 billion.
(and g.m. got slapped!  but the money guys?  kid gloves.)

and they didn't care if their stock market crashed, because
they knew the big loser would be _our_retirement_plans_...

do you really think the whole retirement-money system was
something that these "financial institutions" didn't understand
they could game, at our expense?  talk about a ponzi scheme.

but heck, they learned this trick from the government itself,
with the "social security" system, which is explicitly ponzi...

it's totally silly to say that "dionysian living" caused this mess.
this was _greed_, pure greed, to the point of being _criminal_.
and they knew what they were doing, they knew it _exactly_...
and if you can't see that, you are blind.

Hardly amazing considering the origin of the term ‘free-lancer’, but nonetheless: I am becoming a bit worried. Last year I resumed work after an extended sabbatical and I was really going somewhere, I felt. Now my biggest client is scaling back outsourced work. Which means my projected income for this year will be a quarter of last year if I don’t pick up some new projects.

I am considering a career move ; ).

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding freelance, that’s a tough place to go right now. Doing some networking and getting by on freelance sounds great, but I’m finding that when I go out networking I just run into people looking for work. At the last big networking party I went to almost everyone was looking for work; even the employed people were because they all assume that they’re going to lose their jobs soon. Nobody was there looking for a designer to help with a business venture. Networking isn’t cheap, either: unless an even has a big sponsor, it’s anywhere from $5 to $25 just to get in the door.

At this point I am seriously considering getting some kind of night shift doorman or security job where I can spend a few hours working on fonts in the slow hours. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I heard on the radio this morning that in China, something like 90% of cars are bought cash in hand, 50% of mortgages.

The Western ability to borrow money to pay for what one could have paid cash for is certainly NOT to be blamed on the crooks. The crooks simply acknowledge how hideously stupid some people are and take advantage of them for it.

People and cultures that have a proper awareness and respect for money have done much better for themselves. For instance, in America there are mortgage "lenders" who strictly follow Sharia law for Muslims. Meaning, of course, that interest isn't charged. The person doing the borrowing has to bear a higher burden of a down payment on the home, and the lender has stricter underwriting policies because they only charge a one time fixed fee that is built into the payments. These mortgage companies, and the people who borrowed *only the absolute minimum* have fared well while all of the Western banks and their borrowers have wallowed in their own filthy mess.

There are crooks and deceitful people in this world of all persuasions, governments, religions, families, clans, tribes, institutions, anti-institutions, and kingdoms.

Most of the Ph.D economists out there didn’t seem to have anything especially smart to say about America’s insane economy in the last decade; neither did all of the MBAs who studied macro- and micro-economics from those economists. People didn’t need education to prevent this, they needed common sense and some grip on reality. Any idiot who applied a little critical thinking could see that the real estate market and the stock market were grossly overvalued and that the entire nation was overleveraged. But people chose to ignore what made sense, to ignore the few economists and pundits who were pointing out that the system was a joke, and followed the herd. Economics education can’t prevent that sort of mass delusion any more than religious instruction can enable the devout to see the absurdities in their faith. It just gives people a better vocabulary to discuss their fantasies.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Credit is a great engine of economic progress, but it has to be regulated. In the past, it worked very well to make the US the richest country. But it leads to booms and terrible busts, fueled by speculation and crooks, without regulation. 

I blame the Reaganite philosophy--all taxes and regulation is bad--which infected also Clinton to some extent, for the current financial collapse. Right now, China is attempting to expand credit, agreeing that you need a system of both savings and credit to work well and be stable. I've heard economists saying that part of the problem is that we had too little savings, and China too much. 

You need to realize that in China the savings rate is so high because they haven't been able to trust the banks or government to help them with anything. For example, the government will just quit paying employees for months on end. This kind of thing is also very dysfunctional.

There are no simple solutions, though there do seem to be solutions, and the Obama administration is working at them.    </div>

I disagree.

In hindsight, yes, it's very easy to say that, but at the time, I don't think many people did. 

When the American Dream is home ownership, separated nuclear family units, and both banks and government doing what they can to both market and accommodate that, there is a societal pressure to aim for that. It's not a greed as much as a "that's what we're supposed to do as Americans." And when folks do that in a time of increasingly upward home values, the trend is to 'get in while we can before we can't afford a place' rather than a careful study of long term trends and analysis of the mortgage models that were being sold.

As a culture, we've grown accustomed to economic short sightedness. That's partly due to how our system works (consumer driven) and partly due to lack of personal education on the matter. 

"Economics education can’t prevent that sort of mass delusion any more than religious instruction can enable the devout to see the absurdities in their faith."

I disagree. I think education goes along way. Along with economics 101, I've always been a proponent of theological history taught in the schools as well. :o)

For instance, there's a giant lack of art and design education in our system. It wasn't until college that I found it and had it instilled in me via education. 

As for the current situation, there's plenty of blame to go around to all parties involved. </div>

But from an economic perspective, if you can telecommute or earn your income off the internet, it's feasible to live anywhere (with high-speed connection, that is) and have much, much lower overhead.

But do you have to be a bit of a redneck or a loner to do that, or congregate in colonies (rather than ghettoes)? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I benefitted greatly from the internet early, not just by designing for the web, but by working for publishers in Sydney while living in Melbourne (say, a 1000&nbsp;km). Then the same publishers discovered that they can send their stuff a bit farther, and pay only one-tenth of my hourly fees for it. Even my accountant said to give up!

In the long run, I see only one (rather unfortunate) outcome: a shift of white collar, even creative jobs into the places where manufacturing, prepress, printing, customer service, IT and data processing has gone already. All it takes, is for our customers to send even more work there, then our schools will have to cut down on training unneeded IT guys, engineers, designers, etc., as the schools in the new centres get better and train more and more of the locals.

And then, there are the contests: a book cover for $150 or a logo for $100 to the winner. Bugger!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">it's easy to see something fishy is going on
when you know -- as the banks knew --
that a house that cost $80,000 to _build_
-- according to loans they'd given to the
builder -- was then selling for $200,000.

especially when that $200,000 house was
"bought" by a guy making $2,000 a month,
thanks to a loan given him by the same bank,
who knew (or could have easily found out)
that his income was indeed $2,000 a month,
except they didn't even bother to _check_...

in the old days, they would fine-tooth your
financial records when you bought a house.
"we see you were a month late paying your
phone bill in july 4 years ago, how come?"
and you'd have to respond, "that check was
lost in the mail, so i had to send another."
they grilled you.  it was very unpleasant.

but in the last few years, all of a sudden,
they stopped doing that, and then they
stopped checking on your income at all,
and word got out that they'd give anyone
a loan, so all kinds of people who would
have never thought of applying for a loan
-- who couldn't buy a decent used car,
let alone a nice home in the suburbs --
were suddenly showing up in droves, and
banks just kept making more bad loans...

they _knew_ those loans were bad loans.

this wasn't accidental.  it was malfeasance.

and when that same bank puts a big bunch
of these bad loans into a package and then
sells it back and forth with other banks who
are doing the same thing, that's a _scheme_.

they knew what they were doing, and they
knew it was wrong, and they kept doing it,
because they knew uncle sam was a sucker.
it was illegal.  it was immoral.  it was wrong.

as usual, the average person was just a pawn
in this game being played by the rich guys...

and now a whole bunch of _innocent_people_
are unemployed, or underemployed, and suffer.

rich people?  still pulling million-dollar bonuses.

As far as design services go, there must be some monetary value to living in the local culture you're communicating with.

As for font sales, the market is global. Of course, people in some parts of the world can't or won't spend, say, $39 for a font, but in my experience there are enough who can, in many parts of the world, to keep the business viable.</div>
