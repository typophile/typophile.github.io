  body: "Well, I just want to play with it as a font of only Unicode-based diacritical
    combining. It\u2019s not for any historical record, so it doesn\u2019t matter
    if my anchors would reflect the original ones as long as diacritics placement
    would be the same. Ironically, this arbitrariness in character to diacritic anchor
    matching is exactly what I was afraid of and what is the trickiest part of the
    task. Anyway, some utility that would somehow heuristically figure out such anchoring
    or even its approximation would be quite useful, I think, at least for modernizing
    old fonts. I\u2019ll give it some more thought."

  body: "Let us assume that like in the Adobe example <code>@TOP_MARKS</code>  of
    <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#6.d\">Mark-to-Base
    attachment positioning</a>, we have the base letters <code>a, e, o, u</code> and
    the diacritics <code>acute, grave, dieresis, umlaut</code>. Then it is true that
    to get the glyph for <code>aacute</code> all you need to do is to match the basis
    anchor for the <code>a</code> and the anchor for the <code>acute</code>, and you
    can decide arbitrarily to put either anchor wherever you want. For instance you
    can put the base anchor for  <code>a</code> at <code>(0,0)</code>. However, when
    you have done that arbitrary choice, all the other anchor positions are fixed;
    indeed,  there is then only one position for the anchors of <code>acute, grave,
    dieresis, umlaut</code> that will give the right looking glyph for <code>aacute,
    agrave, adieresis, aumlaut</code> when matching with the anchor for the <code>a</code>
    at <code>(0,0)</code>, and then there is also only one possible position for the
    base anchor on <code>e, o</code> and <code>u</code> that will match any of the
    anchors on the diacritics. The choice is thus unique up to a translation of all
    anchor pairs (you can add the same number to all x values, and the same other
    number to all y values of the anchor positions).\r\n\r\nIn terms of programming,
    you can initialize one of the anchors to whatever pair  you want, and then run
    some algorithm. Now, I don't know what tools are available, I will just try to
    illustrate with one tool I use, namely FontForge. Here is a small script that
    takes as input a fontfile and a list of glyphnames and outputs their foreground;
    I called it <code>dmpfrgrnd</code>.\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n\r\nimport
    sys, fontforge\r\nfnt=fontforge.open(sys.argv[1],1)\r\nfor gl in sys.argv[2:]:\r\n
    \ print gl, fnt[gl].foreground\r\n</PRE>\r\nIf I call \r\n<code>dmpfrgrnd MyriadPro-Regular.otf
    dotlessi iacute acute</code> \r\nI get the following output (with one point per
    line however)\r\n<code>\r\ndotlessi&nbsp;&lt;Layer(cubic)\r\n&nbsp;&lt;Contour&nbsp;(161,0)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(73,0)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(73,484)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(161,484)&nbsp;on&nbsp;&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\niacute&nbsp;&lt;Layer(cubic)\r\n&nbsp;&lt;Contour&nbsp;(155,693)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(252,693)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(130,550)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(67,550)&nbsp;on&nbsp;&gt;\r\n&nbsp;&lt;Contour&nbsp;(161,0)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(73,0)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(73,484)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(161,484)&nbsp;on&nbsp;&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\nacute&nbsp;&lt;Layer(cubic)\r\n&nbsp;&lt;Contour&nbsp;(189,693)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(286,693)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(164,550)&nbsp;on&nbsp;(101,550)&nbsp;on&nbsp;&gt;\r\n&gt;\r\n</code>\r\nHere
    it is easy to see that the <code>iacute</code> is obtained by \"pasting\" the
    <code>acute</code> on top of the <code>dotlessi</code> and moving it <code>(-34,0)</code>.
    As a consequence if the anchor for the <code>dotelessi</code> is at say <code>(10,0)</code>
    then the anchor for the <code>acute</code> needs to be at <code>(44,0)</code>.
    The problem in this particular example is matching the countours. For some fonts,
    the contours for the diacritics are listed first, some other fonts last. Once
    you have matched the contours, it is easy to get the displacement.\r\n\r\nI don't
    know how far one can go with that. During my vacations, I generated an AAT font
    using anchors. Once I was done, I happily moved some diacritics to where they
    seemed to look better. I don't see why professionals (I am not one) would not
    do the same.\r\n"

    should have said \"Once you have matched the contours, you have the displacement\".
    Indeed, matching the contours means finding <code>(dx,dy)</code> such that the
    contours corresponding to the diacritic in the precomposed glyph are obtained
    by adding <code>(dx,dy)</code> to all pairs in the contours of the glyph for the
    diacritic: <code>(dx,dy)</code> is the displacement."

    it so explicit, this indeed clarified my thoughts a bit. I even ran quickly all
    those calculations by hand sketching out the deltas in a matrix for both vowels
    and diacritics and\u2026 well, there was no consistency for any given anchor pair
    I tried. Must have been no anchors and no luck for me."
