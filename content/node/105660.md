  I have designed for myself for use in my work. So when i create the final logo type
  using that typeface, will I be able to transfer the copyright of the logo(only the
  logotype, as a standalone piece of design) to the customer. I am asking this because
  typefaces aren't copyrightable in the US and i dont want the customer to end up
  with a logo that they don't even own full copyright to.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

    is a script wordmark that looks like it was part of a font.\r\nIt is trademarked
    based on an image described as a drawing.\r\nSo perhaps it could be a separate
    IP protection from your font.\r\n....this is why lawyers get rich :)\r\nDon"
