  have a question about semi serif typefaces. Is it up to the designers will to decide
  which serifs to remove or are there guidelines?\r\n\r\nI am new to the forum so
  I am not sure if this is the right place for this thread. If this is not I will
  be glad to move it to the right place as long as someone notifies me about it. Thanks
  in advice."

  body: "Great topic. (I think General Discussion is a fine place.)\r\n\r\nIt's always
    up to the designer. :-)  But I can think of three -potentially combinable- approaches:
    what turns the designer on, \xE6sthetically; what chirography (which sort of means
    handwriting) likes to see, mostly head serifs on the left and foot serifs on the
    right; and what presumably increases readability by differentiating boumas (shapes
    of clusters of letters, often whole words). This last one is my favorite, but
    I have to admit it applies best to text font; for display fonts the second can
    work better, or the first if the font's intent is to be idiosyncratic.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to its designer the serifs in Rotis Semi-Serif was designed with readability-amplification
    in mind. Which does not mean it works to that effect - but at least it tries hard,
    which is more than can be said for most semi-serif designs.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
