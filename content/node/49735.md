body: I am looking for a condensed sans that has pointed vertices in letters like
  A, M, and N. [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=615&subpage=neutra_view_all_fonts|Neutraface
  Condensed]] is a perfect example of what I am looking for but is prohibitively expensive.
  Are there any other sans serifs that maintain pointed vertices in their condensed
  versions? Thanks for your help.

  body: Thanks Miss Tiffany. All caps are fine. Neither of these are quite what I
    am looking for. I am not a fan of the <em>S</em> in either typeface. And some
    of the letters in Mostra are too wide for this project. Anyone else know of any
    other typefaces that fit this description? I am having a surprisingly difficult
    time finding any.

    Closer? \r\n\r\nEdit. Nope. The M and N don't have the sharp apex."

    up using that if I can't find a better alternative.
