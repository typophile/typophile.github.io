body: "This is one technical detail I've never been able to find the answer to. In
  cases where you're listing the speaker of a quote underneath it, preceded by a dash,
  what type of dash this supposed to be? A hyphen? En dash? Em? Is there a standard
  at all? To clarify, this is the format I'm referring to:\r\n\r\n\"It's not the size
  of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog.\" \r\n\u2013 Mark
  Twain\r\n\r\nIs there a correct answer? As of avid user of quotes in designs, I'd
  love to know that I'm knowing it correctly. Thanks so much!"

  body: "You need an em dash, *not* a hyphen or an en dash.\r\n\r\nOne might also
    reasonably use a quotation dash (\u201Chorizontal bar,\u201D U+2015). But not
    all fonts have those. In any case, they are often the same width as the em dash.
    (Despite what you might guess from the name, these are primarily used to set off
    the actual quoted text instead of an opening quote mark, in languages where that
    is the typographic convention.)"

    if your \"em dash\" has space built in around it, maybe you wouldn't do that.
    Some people use no space."

  body: The quotation dash is usually an En dash, at least here in Sweden. But yeah,
    probably Em dash here.

  body: Personally I like the tilde with the curved-in ends, the ones that look slightly
    like a skinny sideways S.  I suppose those this would only work with a font that
    matches that style somewhat, probably a serif. Dont think it would look quite
    right next to Futura xtra bold or the like.

  body: What Nick Shinn and Kent Lew said. No dash should be required in quotes. Plus,
    you shouldn't use the quotation marks either. Just set the quote in roman and
    the author's name in small caps.
