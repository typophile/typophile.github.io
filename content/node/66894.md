body: "I am copyfitting some text to what-will-be a report with letter sized paper
  (though the spreads are double that... and I don't know the name!)\r\n\r\nI am wondering
  if zigzagging the copy is ever permissible and what would be the conditions necessary
  to merit it? Since we are a visual community, a graphic:\r\n\r\n1 2\r\n\r\n3 4\r\n\r\nVoila!\r\n\r\nFollowing
  the grid straight down hits me wrong entirely. The point size is 9/12 so I feel
  as though the type is simply too small to run that much of it. (It's Minion Pro).
  Thoughts? I feel as though I have seen this <strong>1,000</strong> times in other
  publications but alas, I never paid much attention. Visually, the copy is very pleasing
  but even I get a little confused as to the flow; sometimes I read down as opposed
  to across. "

  body: This is a normal reading sequence for comic book panels. For plain columns
    of text, though, you may need some indicator that the column continues across
    rather than down the page half. A centered horizontal rule or rule-like ornament
    should do the trick.

  body: "Edmund Arnold called the ordering you mention a \"Canadian Wrap\" in his
    books on newspaper design in the 50s and 60s. (Very dated now.) Thing is, I am
    in Canada, and had never seen such. Perhaps it was a western Canada thing. There
    would be a deck between the 1/2 and 3/4 levels.\r\n\r\nI personally find it confusing."
