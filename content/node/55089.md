body: "It's clear that this slab-serif has been modified but I am struggling to find
  the original face. At first I thought it was a Quaint Gothic variant but the characters
  from that particular face have too much contrast.\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed some light
  on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: If I had to guess, I would say this was completely hand-drawn. There are some
    elements of copperplate in there though.
