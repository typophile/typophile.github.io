  is.\r\n\r\nI saw an example of Berthold's Quadra 57 BQ (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/quadra-57-bq/)
  that led me to believe it was the absolute perfect solution for a project I'm working
  on.\r\n\r\nProblem is, I can't find it. Anywhere. It's listed on myFonts, but as
  no longer available. Poking around Berthold's site, it's not there at all. All references
  to it that I can find on the web point to myFonts.\r\n\r\nIt's not a new font (1974),
  so I can't imagine any copyright issues that would explain it's disappearance.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know the story?"
