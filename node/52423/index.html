  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Typophiles,

I've been working on a logo for a psychologist / certified mediation expert offering mediation and coaching related services on a freelance basis.

This is the one concept I did a couple months ago and still actually like. I will sketch out a couple other ideas as well, but would first like to get this to a point where I feel it is presentable as a rough (and I'm meeting her next Tuesday). Right now, I'm not quite sure it works.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview_tp_5556.png]

Some notes —

1) That's her name, and that's her first name which is upside down. At the time being, I'me not aware of any sort of by-/sub-/tagline to go with it, although I'll probably suggest using one.

2) I decided to try and focus on the wordmark instead of a 'pictorial' logo, mostly because all the ideas either she or I had for that felt either unfitting, too literal, or boring (paths merging and winding into the distance, across mountains etc.; hands joining together; talking heads)

3) Ezzo feels like it matches her quite well; she's young and a very open and friendly person; she speaks German with a quirky and likeable accent, and is the kind of person who makes other people instantly comfortable with her – down-to-earth would be a good word, and very professional at the same time. 
(Suggestions for other typefaces with this kind of 'feel' are very welcome.)

4) As her name has a bunch of 'boring' letters, but <em>two g</em>s (yay!), I started playing with those, and with the idea of overlapping / linking their descenders (is that the bowl or the loop in English?), drawing on the idea of mediation being about bringing different sides together & acknowledging different perspectives on the same thing. 
I tried to align them so that they don't clog at small sizes, and I seem to 'see' a hairline connecting them smoothly which isn't there, but maybe that's just my brain on too much orange juice trying to fend off the flu.

So, I don't know. Is it too literal? Too minimal? Boring? Too little, too much? Does it work to put her first name upside down like that? I think I've stared at it too long. And I'm thankful for any comments. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">FWIW - the Gs are paired very nicely, their combination looks very fluid and natural. 

However the "Inge" part is quite hard to read. This is primarily because the "ge" part looks like a reflection of its upper counterpart, and so it implies a form of symmetry in the mark. But the "In" part breaks the symmetry and the eye just keeps wandering around trying to find it .. so it takes an effort to stop doing that and to actually focus on reading the name.

How about playing off the symmetry instead ? Basically flip "egm" vertically, place it exactly below the original, mirror each letter and then split "m" into "I" and "n". Something like this:

You know, I was wondering about that … I was afraid it'd just look like it was horridly kerned. ;)  But it actually looks quite interesting. Must give this some thought :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">although the letterforms themselves look very fluid and stylized it just seems completely strange that part of the name is upside down—especially considering this is a very professional field.

i think you should try a different concept</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As is, it bothers me that it reads "Wegmann...Inge," when the name you want to convey is "Inge Wegmann." A potential change that might help this: did you consider having the words go vertically, so Inge would run upwards on the left and Wegmann downwards on the right? That would make the order better - I also think side-to-side "confrontation" might say "mediation" better than the dominator-dominated arrangement you have. So semantically it might work, I'd think, but visually you'd have to try it and see.
Hope that helps.</div>

Craig, I tried doing the vertical thing; not sure if this helps it? I feel it's "heading down" very strongly now. It does now feel like two more equal parts, although the vertical direction scares me a bit (it loses a bit of the "stability" and her being "down to earth", no?).

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/preview_tp_2_5793.png]

I must say I'm not really happy with having her first name upside down, although I'd hope one would read it as a mirroring of some sort, so maybe Alex's idea with reinforcing the symmetry could be a step in the right direction.

FWIW, I just did the 'normal person test' with somebody who had no idea what this is about, and she immediately took to it plus guessed quite correctly what it was for / about, which is reassuring (but of course doesn't mean it doesn't need some tweaking still). 

So thanks again! Keep it coming :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just wanted to get back with a quick snap of what we just got back from the printers.
We (okay: I) have decided to usually set the logo horizontally, but alternately, vertically if the format calls for it (like on the flyer). I think both variants work well. Most importantly though, I haven't often had such an incredibly overjoyed client, so that's good. :-)
Cheers!

		<div class="commentbody">Looks nice mostly. I just don't like positioning of text on business cards, because text tends to be here and there without any specific order. Some of it is right aligned, logo is somewhat centred and bottom part is then right aligned...

Apart from this I really like colour scheme...
