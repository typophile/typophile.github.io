body: "I'm in the proces of designing a logo for an exclusive handmade leather bag
  brand. The logo must contain 'wings' and the name 'soesah'. The client is looking
  for a minimal approach so this is what I came up with. Geometric but still kind
  of organic.\r\n\r\nI would very much appreciate your feedback, primarily on the
  DIN inspired custom lettering. Furthermore do you have any suggestions regarding
  the mark / logotype composition?\r\n\r\nI know logotype is not yet properly kerned.
  This is because I first want to deal deal with the things above. :-)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3781.jpg]"

  body: I like the overall feel; but the 'wings' look too much like three-fingered
    hands. Possibly having the wingtips more feathery, or at least much less rounded
    - maybe pointer ends at the 'top' sides.

  body: "The type looks a bit too mechanical to me. I see it pressed into leather
    and think that smoother curves would look better (think more DIN 17).\r\nAlso,
    the lone h\u2019s ascender could be unbalancing."

  body: "I agree that the wings look like fingers (in a glove, maybe)\r\n\r\nIt might
    need some kind of point-you can even keep some sort of rounded tips if you wish.
    \r\n\r\nFont feels too rigid, maybe something that is shorter/more round? \r\nCould
    work at a smaller size than the wings & with less spacing.\r\n\r\nPost an updated
    version soon :]"

    Still I'am looking for a minimalistic, geometric but still somewhat organic approach.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your feedback anyway. I will explore some more possibilities."

  body: To make the wings look less like hands, how about making them wider. You could
    also consider making the slope of the "arm" part of the wing steeper than that
    of the "feathers" part.

    the minimalist design is achieved. But what I would like to see is a tighter gap
    between the wings and the text. That will somehow punctuate minimalism.\r\n"
