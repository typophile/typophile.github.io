    wonder how realistic these prices are (I've seen such letters sold at similar
    prices before). Has anyone here ever had such letters made, or ordered some? Are
    they always this expensive?"

    an illuminated sign made. Of course for that you are paying for electricians working
    on high ladders, but the cost is always in the thousands for those signs."

  body: "Good idea, Jan. If you happen to see another \"R\" during one of your walks...\r\n\r\nActually,
    for roughly half the cost per letter, I have had such signs custom built and installed
    on the tops of buildings, complete with electrical hook-ups. I prefer it if installers
    do their work from a cherry picker or a bucket truck and most of the elctricla
    work is inside the building. \r\n\r\nThe \"cans: for a number of commonly used
    fonts are avaialable pre-fabricated, including the translucent face. \r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: "I found that site a while back too, very interesting, but I think they are
    <em>rediculously</em> expensive.\r\n\r\nI suspect the letters on that website
    are left-overs / second-hands from demolition sites and such, which they then
    slightly refurbish. So the new price isn't really relevant. They probably buy
    that stuff in bulk, and make a hefty profit on them."
