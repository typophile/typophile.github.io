body: "Hi,\r\nI have an old 'work in progress' font that contains Latin, Greek and
  Cyrillic glyphs created by an old colleage who has since passed over, and it has
  class kerning values assigned inside the font, however, no glyphs have been assigned
  to the class set, using Font Forge to create an FEA file, I can see the following
  under GPOS:\r\n\r\n @kc4_first_1 = [];\r\n    @kc4_first_2 = [];\r\n    @kc4_first_3
  = [];\r\n    @kc4_first_4 = [];\r\n    @kc4_first_5 = [];\r\n .................
  thru to\r\n    @kc4_first_180 = [];\r\n    @kc4_first_181 = [];\r\n    @kc4_first_182
  = [];\r\n    @kc4_first_183 = [];\r\n    @kc4_first_184 = [];\r\n\r\n@kc4_second_1
  = [];\r\n    @kc4_second_2 = [];\r\n    @kc4_second_3 = [];\r\n    @kc4_second_4
  = [];\r\n    @kc4_second_5 = [];\r\n------------------- thru to\r\n    @kc4_second_170
  = [];\r\n    @kc4_second_171 = [];\r\n    @kc4_second_172 = [];\r\n    @kc4_second_173
  = [];\r\n    @kc4_second_174 = [];\r\n\r\nthen \r\n\r\n    pos @kc4_first_1 @kc4_second_34
  31;\r\n    pos @kc4_first_1 @kc4_second_38 102;\r\n    pos @kc4_first_1 @kc4_second_97
  31;\r\n.................... thru to \r\n    pos @kc4_first_184 @kc4_second_164 -41;\r\n
  \   pos @kc4_first_184 @kc4_second_165 -51;\r\n    pos @kc4_first_184 @kc4_second_168
  -92;\r\n    pos @kc4_first_184 @kc4_second_171 -92;\r\n    pos @kc4_first_184 @kc4_second_172
  195;\r\n    pos @kc4_first_184 @kc4_second_174 -123;\r\n\r\nI am wondering, is there
  a way to work out what the constituent members of the class settings would be? I
  do have a list of the glyphs from GDEF table. That probably sounds silly, but I
  would like to finish the font and pass it back to his family.\r\n"
