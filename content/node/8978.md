body: 'Hello to all... it&#39;s been some while since I had much opportunity to contribute.
  Good to have a free moment to get back in the community. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking
  for some ideas, along the lines of type suggestions for an identity I &#40;we&#41;
  are developing. <BR> <BR> <BR>I would love to post the design briefs, but that are
  anything but brief, near 6 pages of 10 point type. <BR> <BR>So here are the basics:
  <BR> <BR>Company: Blume Custom Homes <BR>Type of Company: Custom home builder, 1.5&#43;
  <BR>They are on of the top ten custom home builders around. Building mainly in the
  southwest region. <BR>We have finished the mark and color systems and are now moving
  on to a type system. I am looking for two famlies. <BR> <BR>The feeling is custom,
  artistic, one-of-a-kind, unique, southwestern, arizona, new mexico. <BR> <BR>We
  are using a slightly modified Mantinia for the name in the mark, the subline of
  text &#40;custom homes&#41; is set in Quadratta Sans &#40;sp&#41; <BR> <BR>&#40;1&#41;
  for headlines and use at large point sizes, 24&#43; point sizes. Im thinking a serif,
  possibly even a script. This has to be mature, and challenging, if that makes sense.
  <BR> <BR>&#40;2&#41; A family for body copy, needing SC, text figures and lining
  figures. Im thinking sans, something along the lines of scala, possibly something
  like a semiserif, or wedge even? <BR> <BR>Just looking for some suggestions, I seem
  to be in a bit of a rut. I would like to keep the total for font purchase to aroun
  $300 USD, if possile. <BR> <BR>Love to hear your thoughts. <BR> <BR>Cheers! <BR>

  body: Kyle, <BR> <BR>Cool logotype! Brave usage of colurs as well, and always nice
    to be able to take advantage of the &#34;Golden section&#34;. I guess you&#39;re
    already familiar with the book &#34;Geometry of Design&#34; by Kimberly Elam?
    &#40;ISBN 1-56898-249-6&#41;. Great book about this subject. <BR> <BR>Anyway,
    regarding according typefaces, you might find some of mine appealing? <BR> <BR>1&#41;
    Delicato, Remontoire, Luminance or even Oxtail? <BR> <BR>2&#41; Sophisto or Delicato
    <BR> <BR>See for yourself at; <a href="http://www.macrhino.com" target="_blank">http://www.macrhino.com</a>
    <BR> <BR>Cheers/SH

  body: Tiffany -- <BR>Thats perfect. It really has the contrast wee need, and just
    a touch of that Frank Lloyd Wright vibe. <BR> <BR>We bought it! <BR> <BR>Mario
    was very helpful -- and even sent the typeface over so we could test it out with
    a few things. The client loves it. <BR> <BR>Thanks for the hlep guys &#40;and
    gals&#41;. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.

  body: Kyle, no problemo. I had actually just looked through the FTF library before
    reading your posts. Kinda cool to see more &#34;trajan-esque&#34; titling fonts
    that aren&#39;t Trajan. :^&#41;
