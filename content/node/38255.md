  logotype to represent my design company, BiKlops Design.  You know how when you
  work on something for so long you become blind to it?  That's me.  \r\n\r\nSo, what
  I'm asking is--are any of these good?  Worth continuing with?\r\n\r\nI'm trying
  to communicate fun, young, big-personality, maybe a touch disturbing/strange. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/anygood_3578.jpg]"

  body: Merging a couple of these ideas together, perhaps try a single eye with two
    overlapping pupils?

  body: Bottom three BiKlopians have the most personality to me. But somehow I don't
    think the type should be Bello (?), or they should be redrawn to harmonize with
    it.

  body: "Good ideas.  It is Bello-and I threw it on there knowing it would have to
    be changed later--so great minds think alike.  I'll upload some changes/new ideas
    shortly.  And if anyone else has some guidance, hit me!\r\n____________________\r\nAwesome>>

  body: agree with others. Especially the rightmost - not too fat, not too skinny
    :) Looks weird enough

    are a touch 8-like I might try a non-geometric positioning.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: I definitely like the bottom BiKlops guys, too. I feel like they could get
    a little funkier, though.
