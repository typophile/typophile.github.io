body: "Regarding typography and the use of uncommon letter images, I personally do
  like the (moderate) use of type reflection. Sometimes evidently but also 'undercover',
  as they can function as regular types.\r\n\r\nLike a mirrored 'z' (=s) or a mirrored
  'w' (=m). Well, there are several options.\r\n\r\nIs this a well-mannered way of
  creating a nice text image or just a cheap trick from an Illustrator-freak?"

    body: "That's a very polite way of telling me I'm talking rubbish. :-)\r\n\r\nMaybe
      I should change the question.\r\n\r\nI wonder if one could create (=bring together)
      a set of characters (types) which, by means of rotation and reflection, cover
      the whole alfabet.\r\n\r\nLet's say: e and a act as two representatives of one
      type: e and e-rotated. So do, for example, w and m, or u and n.\r\n\r\nIs there
      a minimal set of characters which are prerequisite for the completion of a whole
      alfabet? And if so, which set?\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know about similar typographic
      experiments?"

      body: My computer at work has this face called "wrongfont" by adobe that seems
        to be along the same lines as what you're talking about. I know I've seen
        it used before, but i can't find it anywhere on the web. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/wrongfont_5212.gif]

        body: "Hmm, the idea is quite like what I had in mind,  but read this way
          it's just a little type play, not to be taken too seriously. It's got some
          interesting elements, however, like the rotated ampersand, which has become
          more of a p than I would have expected. I also like the rotation of h into
          y.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll do some more research. Also on the ambigram; some
          of them look really attractive.\r\n\r\nThx!"
