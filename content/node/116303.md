  body: "'LES MALLES MOYNAT' has been reborn in December 2011 by LVMH group. It was
    a well-known high-end trunk (malle in french) manufacturer. A point to consider
    is almost all companies in the fashion industry business use bespoke typefaces
    and custom lettering (which sounds obvious).\r\nSo, you're right, that's neither
    Futura or Neutraface but this /S is definitely to close to Futura to be a coincidence
    (or a customization).\r\n\r\nA point for Neutraface, from '[[http://popularlogos.blogspot.fr/2011/12/le-dieu-du-luxe-ressuscite-une-marque.html|Popular
    Logos]]' blog\r\n<blockquote>After some search, type has been customized but still
    based on Neutraface.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAnother point for Futura. Baseline of
    their main logo is set in Futura.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moynat_5238.png]\r\n\r\n...
    But 'PARIS' baseline from their website logo looks like Neutraface No.2\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-moynat_6707.jpg]\r\n\r\nActually,
    that could easily be a mash-up of these 2 (or a customization of any of these
    2):\r\n- /L, /E, /O, /N and /T from Futura\r\n- (alternate)/M and /A from Neutraface
    No.2\r\n\r\nAlternatives but all /S are off: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mtt/milano|Milano]],

  body: "Finally, looks like it could be a retracing of an old advertising poster:
    http://www.pinterest.com/pin/457608012107592199[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo-moynat_5869.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
    my final idea would be they modified Futura (or Neutraface No.2) /M, /O, /Y, /N,
    /A and /T to resemble this old advertisement."

    to be, for me, both classy and friendly.

  body: "I'm flattered Mike, but obviously this is Ryuk's fine detective work. BTW,
    what a great advert. The expressions of the owners, and what appears to be an
    hotel employee, are priceless. Photography would be so inferior. The crisp authority
    and stylish quality of _MOYNAT_ is complemented by the hand lettered informational
    text with the flavor of Futura.  No grunge, chicken tracks or kid's scrawl here!
    \ Handlettering like this from the 1920s and 30s is a gold standard. I'm trying
    to decide what digital font would match the mix of clarity, subtle variation and
    friendly tone in the Moynat hand lettering.. Not an easy choice.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks Mike and Don. I was lucky on this one, I don't have your science and
    knowledge so I try compensate pushing Internet to the limits. Was trying to find
    a better logo sample when I came across Moynat Pinterest and discovered this beautiful
    vintage ad with the exact same lettering as we were discussing.

  body: "Here is a Futura Hand Written http://www.dafont.com/futurahandwritten.font
    but it looks childish compared to the lettering in the Moynat Advert. Still have
    not found anything satisfactory with less \"fun\" and more lettering polish.\r\nDon"
