  body: very nice Andrew. do you think you&#39;d do alternates? for instance characters
    with more swash on the end?

  body: the reason i asked this is i see some characters that might work better at
    the end of a line. for instance, the t seems to have too much curl on the end.

  body: 'you&#39;re right, alternates make sense - especially when the uppercase is
    worked out &#40;truly a frightening task&#41; <BR> <BR>about the &#34;t&#34;,
    I think it causes a negative space problem without the curl. <BR> <BR>like so:

    in by 1px. <BR> <BR>thanks, <BR>andrew'

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m planning three versions altogether: <BR> <BR>1. a less ornate
    &#34;italic&#34; version <BR>2. this &#34;script&#34; version <BR>3. alternates
    &amp; ligatures'

  body: 'Very nice! It has this old French smell to it. And the way you&#39;re dropping
    out pixels here and there is brilliant &#40;and it&#39;s a great example of how
    bitmap and outline font design are totally different&#41;. <BR> <BR>Some suggestions:
    <BR>- I&#39;d axe the last pixel on the ascenders of &#34;b&#34; and &#34;h&#34;.
    <BR>- The new &#34;f&#34; is much better. <BR>- I don&#39;t get the stray pixels
    in &#34;g&#34; and &#34;y&#34;. <BR>- I think the &#34;k&#34; and &#34;z&#34;
    are out of character. <BR>- The tick in the &#34;o&#34; is more hindrance than
    help, I think. <BR>- The UC &#34;V&#34; looks unhappy. <BR> <BR>BTW, it sounds
    like you won&#39;t be making a Roman. Could be interesting that way - but if so
    I&#39;d definitely make a less rigid italic and I&#39;d make it a two-pixel-stem
    design. At 15 PPEM it should work out OK, if you make the horizontals 1 pixel
    and keep it loose overall. <BR> <BR>But whatever you do, please do take this all
    the way! <BR> <BR>hhp'
