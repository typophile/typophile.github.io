body: "I'm working on emulating a Weingart type specimen for a typography class. One
  of the layouts appears to require type that is justified only up to a tab stop,
  not to the end of the line. I'm stumped. Besides trying to do this with a text wrap
  box (the easy way out of course!), I can't think of how to do this. I have attached
  a PDF outlining what this looks like. (The magenta line is the desired outer boundary
  of the justification for those three lines).\r\n\r\n\r\nIs this technically possible
  to do? I realize I could just manually track out those lines but where's the fun
  in that?\r\n\r\n\r\nEnrico"
