  Hoefer]] designed Elegance for [[Ludwig and Mayer]] in Frankfurt. In 2005, [[Rebecca
  Allacari]] digitized Elegance for [[Canada Type]], renaming the design <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/sincerely/\">Sincerely</a>.\r\n\r\nElegance/Sincerely's
  design is rather wide (especially the capital letters), and the x-height is low.
  It is a connecting script face."
