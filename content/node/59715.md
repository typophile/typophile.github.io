  body: i have to agree with David, but on the other hand, it has something so "bauhausian"
    that makes me feel atracted to it... and i don't understand what's the connection
    to the songs... the whole spirit of the album requires something diferent in my
    opinion... I think I have about its design a love-hate feeling.
