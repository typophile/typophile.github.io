  see it being used here <a href=\"http://www.graf-von-faber-castell.com\">Graf Von
  Faber Castell</a>, although I can not find a similar web font for the life of me.
  The web font is listed as 'GVFC light' so I couldn't find it that way either. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    is easy to find with a simple Google search?

    body: "I would use Nofret, unfortunately it is not a web font. I was hoping to
      find some similar typefaces and then figure out if they offered a web font.
      \r\n\r\nActually, I couldn't find any useful information on google. I even used
      fonts.com and indentifyfont.com identify tools, but didn't come up with anything
      helpful. Hence, here I am. \r\n\r\nHere is what I found on google below. Don't
      worry, I am actually trying to find the answer myself and not just coming straight
      here. My main goal was to find some individuals who are more knowledgeable regarding
      type then myself. I love it, but still have a lot to learn.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com/#q=Typefaces+similar+to+Nofret+\">Google
      search</a>\r\n\r\nAgain I tested other key words to find stuff, but surprisingly
      I didn't not find much help.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
