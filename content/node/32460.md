  body: 'Looks like my shameful omission of a credit at the bottom of the newsletter
    has become a nice ID Quiz. Hint: it''s from a brand new typeface (at least one
    that hasn''t been available online before), and it''s not available at MyFonts.'

  body: It bears a nice resemblance to Storm's <a href="http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-40-regent">Regent</a>
    as well. Ball terminal goodness. Love it.
