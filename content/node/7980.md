body: Hey guys &amp; gals,  <BR>I&#39;ve got this logo and I know that all the letters
  have been customized with the tails &amp; points and stuff - but I was wondering
  if anybody knew a font that could be used to look similar &#40;after some customizing
  if needed&#41; It just looks like there&#39;s a &#34;base font&#34; here that the
  artist started with - any ideas?  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.geocities.com/xdangerboy/devils.jpg"

    serifs were original to the typeface.

  body: I&#39;m betting that they weren&#39;t - I think they were customized with
    the &#34;tails &amp; points&#34; but I know I can do that if I can just figure
    out the &#34;base font&#34; if there is one...
