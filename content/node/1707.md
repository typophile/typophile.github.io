body: 'Just a general question: <BR> <BR>I was in a pub the other night sitting next
  to an old photograph of Chicago&#39;s Lake Shore Drive from the late 1920s. The
  words on the roadway &#40;not the signage&#41; read from top-to-bottom. It seems
  these days it always reads from bottom-to-top &#40;at least in the States&#41;.
  Anybody know when/why&#42; this changed occurred? <BR> <BR>&#42;I&#39;m assuming
  it&#39;s because bottom-to-top is how you encounter the words while driving, but
  was there some sort of research, government committee, etc.'

  body: '&#62;how fast you&#39;re going over the stuff <BR> <BR>Because it&#39;s also
    in bike lanes, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it. I mean, I ride pretty fast some
    mornings when I&#39;m running late, but not <i>that</i> fast ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#62;It
    works either way. <BR> <BR>It does work &#39;functionally&#39; both ways, but
    grammatically it only works the one way. <BR> <BR>Anyhow, I just found it curious.
    I had assumed that it had always been bottom-to-top.'

  body: Nevermind, I&#39;m blind. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen signs
    on the road like that either, but I never really pay attention.  The only ones
    I can actually remember right now are the ones that say SCHOOL, but they&#39;re
    only one line.

    I think its because of the speed the cars go. A side note I can ride my bike faster
    across town than a car can go, but what the cars do is go as fast as they can
    between red lights. Why, I have no idea. '
