  to id the script font they alerted me that the sans font was not what i thought
  it was.  After scanning a couple hundred fonts I believe it is Proxima Sans Black
  (http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=304880), but I''m not 100%
  as there are subtle differences (could be explained by the screen printing). Thanks
  for looking into this for me.   '

  body: Same as you... I've seen your former post. First thought was HTF Gotham, but
    definitely not it. Then I switched to Proxima Sans. To me, part of the final oblique
    cut of the /r's terminal, it looks very close to Proxima Nova. If you have a little
    chance, Mark Simonson posts regularly here, he may be confirmed this possible
    identification.

    what it is.
