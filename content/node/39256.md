  body: Barclays fonts were originally designed by <a href="http://www.customfonts.com/default.aspx?disp=1">Monotype</a>.
    Although the fonts differ from the logo itself, I have a feeling Monotype may
    have been involved with the rebranding too (i.e. the logotype)... see <a href="http://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/pr_display.aspx?year=2004&pr=223">here</a>.
