body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Blackletter]] : Fraktur</strong>\r\n\r\nIn German,
  the word <em>Fraktur</em> seems to imply a sense of broken-ness. All Blackletter
  types in German are referred to as \"Broken Types\" (<em>gebrochene Schriften</em>).
  Frakturs are the most decorative of the main Blackletter categories, as well as
  the most used, and the most quintessentially German (see [[German Nationalism]]),
  even though they were also used in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, which are non-German
  speaking areas of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Fraktur style of type was invented around 1517
  at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I]] in Nuremberg. Many artists
  and designers were involved in the process, including [[Albrecht Duerer]] and [[Johann
  Neudoerffer the Elder]].\r\n\r\nFraktur quickly overcame [[Textura]] and [[Schwabacher]]
  as the main style of type used within the empire. The style got a boost after Martin
  Luther's first full-translation of the Bible into German appeared on the market\u2014set
  in Fraktur. For a while, Fraktur was regarded as a \"protestant\" type. But it managed
  to be used by the southern Catholics, too.\r\n\r\nAfter the Napoleonic-era, Fraktur
  slowly began to loose ground against [[Antiqua]], as the Germans called [[Roman]]
  type. It disappeared during the 1800s from the Netherlands, Sweden, and the Czech
  lands altogether. By 1900, almost all books sold in Germany that were translated
  from foreign languages, as well as most scientific books, were set in Antiqua. By
  1930, only about half of all books sold were in Fraktur. After the Nazi ban on Blackletter
  type in 1941, the type slowly disappeared out the of public eye. The German Democratic
  Republic (East Germany) managed to print a few books a year in Fraktur, but in the
  West (and today's Germany) Fraktur is usually only used in the following contexts:
  Typographic Games, History, Beer Labels, Gastronomy, Art Books, Heavy Metal, and
  Neo Nazi paraphernalia. \r\n\r\nSome of the most famous historical Fraktur typefaces
  have been digitized, and are available in digital form.\r\n\r\n<em>For information
  on these available fonts, see</em>\r\n[[Unger Fraktur]]\r\n[[Fette Fraktur]]\r\n[[Fruehling]]"
