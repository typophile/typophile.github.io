    here, seems solidly confined to Victorian display types. I suppose these have
    a particular charm of their own, and certainly evoke particular periods and styles
    of typography very well, but I wonder how deeply you have explored other and older
    branches of the blackletter family tree? There are, for example, whole styles
    of blackletter that were developed for continuous text and that more fully integrate
    straight and round forms, making for less stiffness.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is
    this, which not many people have seen: the fraktur symbol glyphs from my Brill
    types, which I commissioned Karsten Luecke to design. This is not a fully functioning
    fraktur font, as the glyphs are encoded as math alphanumerics and spaced as symbols
    for use with roman text in <em>apparatus critici,</em> but I think it is a very
    fine design that I hope Karsten will complete and release as stand-alone fonts.
    It harmonises extremely well with the Brill roman, on account of mirroring the
    swelled stroke constuction, which is unusual in blackletter types although found
    in 18th Century German scribal exemplars.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BrillFraktur_4395.png]"

  body: Hrant, you seem in danger of arguing against yourself, since what readers
    find legible 'these days' is a matter of familiarity, and if not necessarily of
    reading best what they read most, of reading well what they have learned to read.
    In my experience, learning to recognise the letters of a particular style in a
    writing system that you already know is one of the easiest of things. I don't
    think this is any kind of professional advantage that a 'layman' lacks, but is
    rather a core human ability that we have harnessed to the purpose of reading for
    a very, very long time. True illegibility is only found when there is no consistency
    within the style.

    - as you imply I'm a big fan of that sort of thing. However it has to be done
    subtly/gradually and with intent - you can't throw a classical blackletter at
    a general readership and say \"deal with it\". The good news is that the real
    value of blackletter doesn't depend on a handful of archaic structures.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>True
    illegibility is only found when there is no consistency within the style.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nTo
    me that's <em>unreadability</em>. In the terminology I use (which is pretty widespread)
    illegibility arises when an individual symbol is closer to some familiar character
    than it is to what it's supposed to be (or so far from the intended character
    that it's hopeless). For example the \"A\" and \"S\" in Brill will be confused
    for \"U\" and \"G\" respectively; probably not by people for whom the font was
    designed, but people in general. This idea is of course not my invention - it's
    presented quite explicitly in Bain & Shaw's \"Blackletter: Type and National Identity\".\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    another -- is only one form of illegibility, and I doubt if many people would
    consider it the most obvious. The other form of illegibility is simply inability
    to identify the signs at all, and my point is that this occurs if the forms are
    inconsistent within a style such that the style cannot be learned. As long as
    letterforms are consistent, it is remarkably easy to learn to read a new style
    of writing or typography within a familiar script system; this is even the case
    where the system itself permits of what I would call consistent variation, e.g.
    Arabic. People do this to one degree or another all the time, often without even
    realising that they are learning something new (and notoriously, sometimes without
    even being conscious of the differences, as in the case of people who'd never
    noticed 'the little feet').\r\n\r\n<em>...you can't throw a classical blackletter
    at a general readership and say \"deal with it\"</em>\r\n\r\nI think this is a
    matter of will rather than ability. It isn't that general readers couldn't easily
    figure out the identities of the letters and become proficient in reading the
    style in short order, but that their reading experience had been shaped by a fairly
    narrow set of styles and they are not used to being asked to learn new things
    in the sphere of reading, so are likely to be unwilling to try. But in the area
    of text typography, I think this is almost as true for the kind of new blackletter
    you promote as for any of the traditional styles. If you set a book or a magazine
    in Fraktoer, the likelihood of a general readership accepting it, buying it and
    reading it seems to me about the same as if you set it in the Brill fraktur. This
    has nothing to do with readability, but only with convention and perceived effort."

    would not be my favourite script, I can see the attraction in black letter as
    a pen-written script, but black letter as a typeface is always a failure for me.\r\n\r\nLook
    at Gutenburg's black letter and there is clear evidence of it's pen-written origins.
    Having practised and studied calligraphy a little, I was always taught that, in
    black letter, the vertical spaces between the strokes should be visually equal

    are a few observations on aspects not raised in the discussion.\r\nFraktur --
    the most common typeface for books printed in blackletter before WWII -- was incomprehensible
    to me when I started to learn it in 1990. Most of the lowercase was understandable
    although a few letters like _k_ and _x_ were a challenge. However much of the
    uppercase was impossible. It took months before I could confidently tell the difference
    between letters like _V_ and _B_. As for the circularized _K_ and broken backed
    _H_... I have no doubt that my experience is typical of the few people who have
    attempted to learn how to read Fraktur in recent decades.\r\nFor over a century
    type designers have reformulated blackletter to make it legible without a special
    course of instruction. Some of the best efforts were done before WW I, notably
    by people like Behrens & Koch. \r\nThe expressiveness of blackletter is a strong
    motivation for continued attempts to bridge the legibility gap.\r\nI do notice
    a resurgence of blackletter in the most unexpected places. For many years non-German
    readers accepted blackletter in the context of religious texts. Then came rock
    music, particularly the heavy metal genre. Bikers. Tatoo aficionados. Today blackletter
    simplified Old English  is the signature of a Los Angeles street scene clothing
    created by a Latino company _Born + Raised_. Blackletter as the means of protest
    against the Man. Go figure!\r\nDon"
