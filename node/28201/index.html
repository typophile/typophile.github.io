<p>I&rsquo;m currently undergoing research into the form and function of typography. The research and investigation will go towards a final paper that develops on the ideas researched.</p>
<p>In investigating my hypothesis, <strong>&lsquo;In contemporary society the funtion of type is more important than its form,'</strong> I hope to come to some conclusion, or, develop a better understanding of the relationship between form and funtion, in regards to typography in contemporary society.</p>
<p>I thought that perhaps some of the members of Typophile would be interested in discussing this. Any opinions, or discussion would be very muchly appreciated.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Obviously a specific graphic communication need can dictate the form of the typeface some company commissions from a certain Type Designer. In this case form follows function. An example you have &ldquo;classic&rdquo; typefaces such as Frutiger among tons of other examples all over signage, corporate identities, etc.
However the opposite, where the form of a typeface dictates its usability also happens a lot, if not more often since most of the typefaces are available to a global market.</div>

<p>Might give you some thoughts, the form-follows-function argument is hardly new though, so I don&rsquo;t really understand why it would be more relevant to contemporary society than it was to early 20th century society.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes of course, in the process of type design one can either develop the most appropriate from for a given purpose, or decide to follow a formal approach, which will determine it&rsquo;s functionality and usage later on nonetheless. My conclusion from that is that you can&rsquo;t simply let form play against function and determine which is more “important” since both   are in a relationship so close and complex that you can&rsquo;t objectively isolate one from the other.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You can throw marketing into the mix as well.  Function can be defined more broadly than readability and reproducibility in a given environment. The type must function for the market it is used in as well. Function is quite fuzzy here since a publisher, designer, or art director will base function on their own experience.  The question becomes, will this typeface and this layout (the 2 cannot be separated)sell the product or communicate the proper tone for this message better than some other combination? Here the form plays a role in the function. Does an elegant script do a better job of selling perfume than a more readable book face? Would a health report lose credibility set in Comic Sans?  To me form and function are joined at the hip.  You can see them as entities but you cannot remove them from each-other.  While function may appear to be the more rational of the two, measuring it relies on the form to begin with.  The rationale for the form may follow the rationale for the function but there is far more human interpretation involved than can be defined scientifically.</p>

<p>Experimental JetSet and Designer&rsquo;s Republic have used Helvetica because it is common, not for any formal reasons. (This is significantly different than classical Swiss modernism, where the important values are horizontal scale, weight, and slant, not typeface, which just gets in the way of those other &ldquo;21 Univers styles&rdquo; considerations.)</p>
<p>Non-professional users stick with the font defaults in their software, to the same effect as ESJ etc.</p>
<p>In the modern art community, especially the UK, aesthetics is derogated by artists who are primarily conceptual, so Ariel is the type of choice, again a &ldquo;no-choice&rdquo; decision.</p>

<p>Why &lsquo;in contemporary society&rsquo;? Are you positing that in earlier society the form of type was more important than the function, or that form and function were equally important, and that there has been a recent shift?</p>
<p>If there has been a shift, I think you could make a good argument, from within contemporary graphic design culture, that the opposite is true: that the form of type is treated by many designers as more important than its function. One has only to look through the pages of so-called typography annuals to see evidence of this, of type used primarily as a graphic element not as a medium of language and textual content.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Come on, a choice simply can&rsquo;t be a no-choice-decision! 
Helvetica and Arial have become hip again since people wanted things to look somewhat “undesigned” (rebellion and all that:-), and that clearly is a formal decision. Which might prove being “functional” as well since it appeals to a hip target audience.
The point i am making is you can&rsquo;t produce something visual and pretend aesthetics and form wouldn&rsquo;t play a role, whatever way you&rsquo;re going, it is visual, it is physical, so it necessarily does have a form.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To make myself clearer, being “common” is a connotation (even a formal one!) of Helvetica and Arial, and both are typefaces that can only be identified by their form – a typeface doesn&rsquo;t have anything else but it&rsquo;s form to identify itself among the probably unlimited number of variants of the latin alphabet. 
Having that said, i dare say that the choice to use Helvetica, Arial, etc. by designers like DR and EJS is even more driven by formal aspects than say choosing between Garamond or Bembo for a novel.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Norman Dexel (non vérifié) | 09/06/06 |  emigre 65 &ldquo;Helvetica again&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Why do you use Helvetica ?</p>
<p>There are many reasons why we use Helvetica. Each is very different and sometimes seemingly contradictory, and they slowly but constantly change. Some of these reasons may be hard to follow, but we like to believe that it is exactly the complicated nature of our reasoning that, paradoxically, makes our designs so practical and clear.
One of these reasons involves Helvetica’s neutrality. Of course, we fully realize that no typeface is neutral, and that Helvetica’s objectivity is a myth. But it is exactly this myth that turned Helvetica into one of the most widely used typefaces in the first place. So it is fair to speak of a myth that created its own reality. In that sense, Helvetica’s neutrality resembles a self-fulfilling prophecy. This neutrality, real or imagined, enables us and the user to fully focus on the design as a whole, neutralizing the typographic layer as a way to keep the concept as clear and pure as possible. There are cases, however, where for specific reasons, the concept demands a less neutral typographic layer. In those cases we never hesitate to use other typefaces. But those cases are rare</p>
