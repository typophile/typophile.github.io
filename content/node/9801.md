  for a magazine title called &#34;The Prism&#34;. <BR> <BR>I love Dragon &#40;<a
  href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/dragon/ef-extra-light/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/dragon/ef-extra-light/</a>&#41;
  but the &#34;h&#34; is a bit of a problem unless it is incorporated into the design
  &#40;like having the year and issue # to the left of the h&#41;. <BR> <BR>Beaufort
  &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/</a>&#41;
  corrects the &#34;h&#34; problem, but the text on a whole looks too plain and loses
  the jazz and flavor that Dragon has. <BR> <BR>Do you have any other ideas for something
  like Beaufort and Dragon, or even a completely different font? <BR> <BR>Thanks.
  <BR>-Will'
