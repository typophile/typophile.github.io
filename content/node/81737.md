body: I'm looking for a type that I can use to imitate the "Zipper" on One Times Square.
  Basically an upper-case sans serif broken into dots. I'd normally be able to come
  up with this on my own, by all my type specimens are packed for an office move.
  Any suggestions? Thanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/zipper_3659.jpg]
