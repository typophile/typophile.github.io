<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This is my first serious try to design a typeface. Im just doing it out of fun but im thinking it should be a font used as a textfont.
Before i try to scetch the rest of the letters i would like to hear some critics about these letters i have already done.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Looks very good, but there is one clear mistake: the lower half of the 'x' is--or at least seems to be--the same size as its upper half, what makes it look smaller, hence unstable. You should make the lower half bigger, and also make sure it's at least as wide as the upper half.

<div class=commentbody>Thanx for the reply. I have changed the g and the x. I hope it looks better now.
<a href=http://lastraw.de/Steven/ggxx.jpg>the g and x (jpg)</a>
Also I thought that the horizontal serifs of the f, g and t looked too thin. I streched them a bit. Is it right in this way or do u think it looks dumb!?
And also a few more letters are done.

<div class=commentbody>Hey,
The 'x' and 'g' are much better now.
As for the horizontal serifs of the 'f', 'g' and 't', their width is just fine, but I'm not sure about their height. Shouldn't you place them a little lower, so that their upper outline would be exactly the same height as the upper outline of the 'x'? I think you should.
And is it really okay to call the horizontal stems of the 'f' and 't' "serifs"? I doubt it... ;-)

<div class=commentbody>Thanx for the lesson in type anatomy. I'm new into type etc. but i also was a bit unsure if it is correct to call these things serifs.
I also have a question about drawing curves in a letter. When I was transforming text into curves in Freehand I noticed that the most curves have much more bezierpoints than I used in my letters. For example I tried to draw the Arial f. A curve in the original letter has got 3 or more points. I would draw the same curve with just 1 point!? Should I try to use more points!? Why it is important to make more points, even if the letters look like the same!? I take notice that it is much more difficult to draw a curve with more than 1 ponit!

<div class=commentbody>The ideal is always to use minimal number of Bezier points needed, both for economic reasons (the font file becomes smaller) and visual reasons (simpler curves tend to look "smoother"). I guess the reason why Freehand showed more Bezierpoints than necessary was that you used a True Type version of Arial, while in Freehand curves are described with the same polynomials as Type 1 fonts, not True Type. The extra points were probably added during the process of translating the latter into the former, but they're useless.

<div class=commentbody>I've got a few quick comments, but keep in mind I'm a novice type designer. The terminal of the "c" is a bit too long. Your "d" feels unbalanced to me. Looking at your "d" and "p", you need to make sure that you give your bowls enough space from your junction points. Notice how your curves go in nicely on your "m", "n" and "h" and still give your stem some breathing room. That adds legibility to your face. Promising start, keep chuggin'.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Which terminal of the c do u mean!? The upper teardrop-terminal or the terminal at the bottom!? I think I like them both. But if I change the teardrop do i have to change the teardrop in the same way at the a!? (because they are identically now) Or if I change the terminal at the bottom do I have to change the therminal at the e too!?

<div class=commentbody>The terminal at the bottom is slightly longer than your e terminal at the bottom. Just a little visual adjustment, not a major change. </div>
