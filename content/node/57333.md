  etc. I've seen one font that did this. No, i don't remember which one. I can see
  the appeal of a full range of small caps sized characters. I'm just not certain
  that it is worth all of the extra work involved. So,thoughts? Opinions? Examples?~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

    end in acronyms? I just can\u2019t see the extra characters justifying the effort
    unless a client is paying for them."

  body: "Of the small caps fonts that I have, the smalls are not just sized down standard
    caps. Their shapes have been altered to work with the uppercase. If you had an
    entire character set like that, you would essentially have a  different weight
    of the same typeface - albeit of a different scale.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

  body: "I don't design type, but I don't think you should make smaller non-letters.\r\n\r\nFull
    caps are designed to be used within lines of miniscule letters; they're not really
    designed to be sued next to each other. Small caps are designed to match miniscule
    letters in weight and size so that you can set full words in caps.\r\n\r\nThe
    rest of the typeface is designed to match lines of mostly miniscule letters, and
    small caps are capitals that look more like miniscule letters, so small caps should
    work better with the normal versions than the adjusted versions that you propose."

  body: "Ha, I've been wondering the same thing.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"small caps are capitals
    that look more like miniscule letters\"</cite>\r\nYes but: they don't have extenders,
    and I do think that matters proportion-wise, for example when small caps are followed
    by a \"normal\" colon or semicolon* &ndash; I've found myself unhappy with such
    a combination more than once (but I don't have the time right now to dig up examples,
    sorry). That's one application where I could really see a point (ha, ha) for small
    caps punctuation. But maybe that's just me.\r\n\r\n* By \"normal\" I mean the
    usual placement of having the bottom dot in a colon line up vertically with a
    period, and the top dot reaching the x-line. Those can look comically oversized
    next to small caps."

  body: "Ah! I thought I remembered some situation where I really wanted to adjust
    them! Another thing that bothered me once was the vertical location of the hyphen.\r\n\r\nBut
    these are fundamentally changes of location and white space rather than changes
    of weight, shape and size; I don't think they were the types of changes about
    which James S was asking."

  body: Setting a headline in all small caps cause trouble with tall punctuation,
    like a question mark, an exlamation mark, a percentage mark and so on. I can definitly
    see the use for sc-numerals as well.

    for headings, etc., and having appropriate numerals and punctuation would make
    me a happy person.

    do an ampersand @ sign and at least currency marks to fit for text faces. Quote
    marks way up in the sky with smallcaps look silly to me, so do huge question marks
    and parens, braces, etc. I just try to see it from a users perspective and follow
