    still available.

  body: "And thanks Mike for the reminder about lettering master  Michael Schwab.
    This is a perfect case of where lettering with it's subtle variations trumps a
    font with its precision or artificial grunge/rugged treatment.\r\nAs for fonts,
    the closest to the GARLIC letters is Neville Brody's orphan font, Bonn Caps Bold,
    found  by Fivos. To make something similar from a legitimate source we are struck
    with something like Arquitecta Black.\r\nDon"
