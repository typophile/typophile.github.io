  found a direct answer to my question, so... thank you in advance :)\r\n\r\nThe case:\r\n\r\nI
  felt in love with one typeface - Rotis, particularly - Rotis Semi Serif. I've made
  the cyrillic letters (the ones on the picture).\r\n\r\nThe question:\r\n\r\nWith
  all my I respect to Otl Aicher... can I or the people I gave the font use it legally?\r\n\r\n"

    in 1991 in the German village Rotis. This typeface design would have been protected
    for a period of 25 years, if it had been registered at the Munich design patent
    office, but by glancing through old Munich design patent records I could not find
    a registration for it, so that I guess that it had never been registered.\r\n\r\n(Typeface
    designs are not copyrightable in Germany, so this is no issue.)"

    I respect to Otl Aicher... can I or the people I gave the font use it legally?\"\r\n\r\nSo
    that's a respect and ethics question. I think it's ethically and respectfully
    okay to redist a Cyrillic font inspired by the Latin font, but included lifted
    Latin outlines would be ethically and respectfully wrong.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "thanks, simon!\r\n\r\ni've made an evaluation version of the font with cyrillic
    AND latin characters. i'm using this version to fix the kerning problems. this
    release includes the information, that the typeface is designed by Otl Aicher.\r\n\r\neven
    if there were no latin characters the credits would be the same - not me, but
    this great designer \"invented\" the typeface. i just added the cyrillic letters.\r\n\r\nmay
    be the subject line is misleading, but for me the problem is not exactly about
    designer's ethics.\r\n\r\nif the Rotis typeface was published as an Open source
    project, there would be no problem at all. but it is commercial product - as far
    as i know adobe and monotype sell it.\r\n\r\ni don't want to break their license,
    but their product miss the cyrillic alphabet. and even if they add cyrillic language,
    it would be not exactly the bulgarian cyrillic letters. there are small differences
    between glyphs in russian (for example) and bulgarian cyrillic.\r\n\r\ni don't
    want to make money from this. if my version meets their requirements i will let
    them incorporate my cyrillic. but i doubt about this :)\r\n\r\nyes, you're right
    - it would be ethically and lawfully ok, if i make a font with only cyrillic letters,
    BUT the world is moving toward Unicode, when one font can include all the languages.
    it is silly to have this conflict between technology and law.\r\n\r\nsorry about
    the long posting - i've been just thinking loudly :)) and sorry about my poor
    english"

  body: "Your dilemma is not unusual. Typically I think first port of call would be
    the font\u2019s EULA. Does it permit personal-use modifications. If not then the
    second port of call would be the font vendor \u2013 are they interested in taking
    your Cyrillics and/or legitimizing your design? After exhausting these options
    you get onto the more shaky ground. Re-using the Latin outlines is a no-no, as
    is using the trademarked name \u2013 beyond that could you legitimately redraw
    the Latins as some kind of revival? Read John Downer\u2019s Emigre article on
    revivals and also check out the typophile thread on Raph\u2019s Centaur revival.
    My guess is that Rotis is too recent a design for a revival to be seen as legitimate
    by the type community."

  body: "In order to make sure (and I would have done this before I set down to do
    the work :-), I would contact the guys who \"own\" the font, i.e. are said to
    have the copyright. I am not quite sure, but I think there is a version from Adobe
    and one from Monotype, the latter being the the original version, I believe.\r\n\r\nI
    personally think that the font will probably still be copyrighted (as software),
    but the design - I agree with Uli (wow!) - is probably not patented anymore, if
    it ever was (strange that Agfa should forget about something that important).
    So if you create a cyrillic design and pack it into a new font, than there should
    be no problem. However, the name may be a registered trademark - you might want
    to give this type a different name - something like Cyrillic Rotislike, or some
    such thing :-)) I am quite sure Monotype did NOT forget about this!!! :-)) "
