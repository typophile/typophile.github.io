    this has been hand-drawn or possibly a modified version of a standard font. There
    are a few fonts in a similar vein by Laura Worthington (Ganache, Funkydori and
    Number Five) that could have been used as the basis for that particular design.\r\n\r\n(Note:
    Soft Fa\xE7ade\u2019s new website logo appears to be based on Kari Regular Italic
    by Positype.)\r\n\r\nHope this helps."

    -- the name suggests dairy, yoghurt etc:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hubertjocham/crema/\r\nThere
    are also other buttery scripts such as Tartine Script http://www.identifont.com/show?27MD
    that you might find useful.\r\nDon"
