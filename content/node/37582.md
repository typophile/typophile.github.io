  my ID manuals or ID Help on how to make inch marks. In Quark you just use the control
  key, so I am sure there must be a simple way to do this without turning off curly
  quotes in Preferences every time an inch mark is needed.\r\n\r\nSo can someone enlighten
  me?\r\n\r\nMuch thanks!"

    Not the up-and-down primes you get with the control key. I use the Universal News
    + Commercial Pi font.\r\n\r\nHit 8 for single prime. Hit 9 for double.\r\n\r\nThey
    look so much better than the others. I'm sure other typographers have other ways
    to do this.\r\n\r\ngood luck.\r\n\r\npowers"

    some foundries are putting these characters in their OpenType fonts.\r\nI am,
    but haven't released any yet.\r\n\r\nSo you would use the glyph palette to set
    them.\r\n\r\nYou could cheat by using the \"hungarian umlaut\" -- a double-acute
    accent, which might do the job depending on the font, and which is easily accessible
    with option-shift-g."

  body: "In ID3 just hold down Alt instead of Ctrl. But as others have pointed out,
    that doesn't produce true inch marks, it's just a convenient way to get non-curly
    quotes.\r\n\r\nTrue primes can be found at Unicode U+2032 and U+2033. They're
    under the Punctuation category in ID's glyph palette."

  body: "As has been mentioned, most fonts don't come with U+2032 and U+2033.\r\n\r\nBut
    . . .\r\n\r\nWhen making these up for a font that lacks them, skewing a \"quotesingle\"
    works about as well as rotating it -- better in some ways, worse in others. I
    tend to use a little of both. So, in InDesign, you could set the quotesingle &
    then just slant it about 15 degrees for a reasonable prime/minute/foot. And of
    course, the quotedbl for minute/inch.\r\n\r\nFWIW "
