  body: From the distortion I&#39;d say it&#39;s the back of a hockey uniform...

  body: Serge, is that an Edimond Oiler Uniform? If so write to them, I&#39;d bet
    they would help you.

  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a digital font, but a &#39;uniform font&#39; that
    exists <BR>for the people in the sports uniform biz. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.image-fashion.com/Transfer.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.image-fashion.com/Transfer.htm</a> <BR> <BR>Not unlike
    the &#34;Thank You&#34; Trash Can fonts <BR>that exist in the world of refuse.  <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Lately, teams have been using custom fonts <BR>for player names, but
    back when Gretzky was <BR>with Edmonton, &#40;pre-1988&#41; they probably just  <BR>went
    with Varsity or Pro Block. <BR> <BR>bj
