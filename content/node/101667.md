  from the Typophile Circle of Wise People...\r\n\r\nIf the sanskritweb.net section
  on font forgeries is somewhere near to being accurate (rather than just shark baiting),
  then the following questions seem relevant to ask:\r\n\r\n1. Take Bitstream fonts
  as an example. It seems that a large percentage of Bitstream fonts are forgeries
  of Linotype fonts. See this for a comparison of Bitstream-to-Linotype font names:
  http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/bitstream2.pdf . How is this legally possible?
  And why does it persist? One of the universal messages that comes through loud and
  clear in sites such as Typophile is that designers (font & creative) are pretty
  proud and protective of their work. How would Nick S. or Mark S. feel if someone
  systematically forged their libraries? Not only does the forgery-thing seem to be
  widely tolerated, the industry treats people like M. Carter as celebrities. Why?\r\n\r\n2.
  In various design-related forums, including Typophile, Bitstream typefaces are highly
  regarded. In fact, often they are preferred over conventional Linotype/Monotype
  offerings... say, Univers versus Zurich, or several of the historical types. Is
  it truly because Bitstream fonts are exceptionally well designed, or that some social-psychological
  reaction is occurring which triggers a David vs. Goliath image within us? And now
  that Goliath (Monotype) has acquired the twin Davids of Bitstream and Linotype,
  what is to eventually happen to what forgeries?"

  body: "Ah, so you like big business. You're going to love the new Monotype conglomeration.\r\n\r\nThere
    is so much nonsense in the article you cite, I'll make just one of many possible
    comments:\r\n\r\nYup, Bitstream \"copied\" Linotype fonts. Probably because most
    of the top talent in the drawing room at Linotype U.S. (mainly the artistic guys,
    not the corporate) left to form Bitstream. (Aside: I believe that David Berlow
    left Linotype to start FontBureau without a stint at Bitstream. And while not
    designers, I wouldn't call either Cherie Cone or Mike Parker \"corporate.\")\r\n\r\nSince
    (1) corporate strategy at Linotype, at the time a subsidiary of Allied Chemical,
    was simply to rake in profits (which included doing the bare minimum to the old
    fonts to sell them in the new digital world), and (2) since you cannot patent
    a type design, (3) Bitstream did the work. \r\n\r\nIt was pretty generally felt
    at the time that the Bitstream PostScript fonts were far better than the Linotype,
    but not as complete -- At that time, Bitstream rarely offered old-style numbers,
    small caps, etc.\r\n\r\nYeah, I was there in the 1980s, and a locked-in Linotype
    customer. Before PostScript, high-end Linotype fonts were locked to a particular
    typesetting machine. \"Particular\" here means not only brand, but individual
    machine. If you bought a new machine,  you bought the fonts all over again, albeit
    with a discount. BTW, a maintenance agreement for the $20,000+ machine was about
    1/5 the purchase price. In other words, you bought it all over again every 5 years,
    even if nothing went wrong. \r\n\r\nOf course, you didn't have to have a maintenance
    agreement. But parts carried quite a markup, and could be hard to get except from
    the parent company. And if you weren't on contract, time went for $100/hour as
    I remember, & started when the technician left for the airport... I believe you
    picked up the plane ticket...and technician availability was such that maintenance
    agreement customers came first... In other words, most everyone bought a maintenance
    agreement after the first breakdown.\r\n\r\nLinotype, Monotype, etc. were not
    about \"artistic integrity...\" What in this world is?\r\n\r\nBTW, did you know
    that when Sumner Stone opened the Stone Type Foundry, he had to license the \"Stone\"
    family from ITC in order to be able to sell it with the \"Stone\" name?"

    ago Bitstream delivered a heartfelt public apology at an ATypI conference (Leipzig?)
    and announced they would no longer stoop so low. I fondly remember being one of
    the first audience members to applaud them, and to this day I remain impressed

    would allow that.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/99972\r\n\r\nLegal,
    sure. Can't see how it's ethical. Probably I'm missing something in my understanding
    of ethical principles. I can't understand a lot,  like with the far right in the
    U.S., who want to go back to the good old days and favor life-saving medial practices
    (now that we've gone beyond the relatively cheap blood-letting) only for those
    who can afford them, or the far left, who will help their neighbor only if it
    can be done through some anonymous program that limits total liability. No doubt
    a defect in me that Hrant will expound on, and I will ignore.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAs
    for type in the 1980s, how many of you know how it was sold? Who designers worked
    for? How much work was needed aside from the \"design\"? That was the climate
    that gave rise to Bitstream. Also, a bit earlier, to Compugraphic, A-M, etc.  \r\n\r\nBTW,
    \"Compugraphic\" was also the format recommended by Bringhurst's publishers, Hartley
    & Marks, for storing all text data, until Quark came along. At that point, they
    recommended storing all data in Quark. And that made such great sense to everyone
    -- those of us who said \"wait a minute\" were shouted down. Our company stuck
    with ASCII, & guess whose files are most easily convertible today? Times and technologies
    do seem to matter.\r\n"

  body: You're right. If I accept Bitstream's work as not being a matter of ethics,
    and I do, yours in the quoted context has the same status. My brain's become like
    an old data-retrieval system that doesn't work quite right. The word I wanted
    to pull up was "hypocritical," not "unethical."

  body: "First of all, I didn't call you unethical. Why are you making a personal
    attack? And don't pretend you're ignoring me when you're addressing things I write.\r\n\r\nI
    can't assume that somebody who released a font under the Apache license (especially
    as recently as Roboto) was unaware of other options, specifically ones that forbid
    resale. What I can assume is they were thinking what I've been thinking (which
    I've explained on Typophile but you seem to be conveniently ignoring): the Apache
    license brings in people (like me) who otherwise would have trouble justifying
    lending their efforts to -further- improving typographic social justice. I do
    it enough already! Do you think I can house and feed four kids just by selling
    Armenian fonts? Not having to make a usable Latin font for an Armenian+Latin system
    saves so much time, it's not even funny. Please, Charles, just try making a text
    font! And you'll see what I mean.\r\n\r\nAnd guess what I would do if somebody
    who released an Apache font regrets it and asks me not to make money from it?
    What about you? If the designer of a libre font you rely on wants to switch it
    to proprietary and asks you to buy it or stop using it (even though he would have
    no legal or practical basis) what would you do?\r\n\r\nBut enough about me. Do
    you think Bitstream was wrong to apologize?\r\n\r\nBTW I started designing type
    (if only bitmap fonts) in 1982, but frankly didn't start \"mingling\" until the
    late 90s. However I've read/talked about previous eras with many people. Many
    of those people lost respect for Bitstream; some of those regained it when they
    apologized.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
