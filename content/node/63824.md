  body: It looks like it's a customised version of Didot. the 'J' looks like an 'r'
    with the stem pulled longer and flipped. The 'W' looks like an 'm', again flipped
    and stretched in the right places:D and the 'y' might well be a 'h'. If you have
    illustrator it shouldn't be too hard to construct it.
