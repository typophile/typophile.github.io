  body: Are you sure this tatoo is based on an actual type design? It looks a bit
    like these &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; Celtic rune-like thingies. <BR> <BR>I think
    it&#39;s possible to find similar stuff, but I can&#39;t think of anything at
    the top of my head.

    very nice tattoo, unfortunately not mine.  I would agree with the <BR>other posters
    that it has a Tolkien script/Runic style feel, although <BR>those scripts are
    more open and non repetitive like this script is. <BR>Perhaps, however, it is
    some hand drawn version of Scriptoriums Rheismol <BR>- <a href="http://fontcraft.com/scriptorium/arcana/"
