  body: "Armin Haab's _Lettera_ Vol 1 1959 [1954] has a high quality reproduction
    at pp. 82-83 of Jean Midolle's _Alphabet Lapidaire Monstre_ of 1834-35\r\nIt is
    also reproduced in Frederick W. Lambert's _Letter forms_ 1964 at p. 119\r\nToday's
    Trivia: The bottom third of each letter includes surnames of famous men which
    begin with the  letter. Some of the people are obscure today, such Quinault, but
    others such as Goethe and Rabelais are still familar. Urban Outfitter used some
    of the letters on it's shopping bags in 2008.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: I seem to recall that one of the many Dover books on decorative alphabets
    and initials (perhaps Nesbitt's aptly named <em>Decorative Alphabets and Initials</em>?)
    had a reproduction of this font. Digitizing it would be a nightmare; better to
    buy the book and scan the letters.

  body: I have copy in "Early Advertising Alphabets, Initials and Typographic Ornaments",
    edited by Clarence P. Hornung, Dover Publications. The letters are so detailed
    and the book isn't large enough for a scan to help all that much.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/lapidaire
    Monstre4_4642.jpg]And there's no W!

  body: "Hi Dick, I'm familiar with the Hornung book. The reproduction quality is
    OK for for most fonts but not for a fine line specimen like this. I recommend
    the Haab Lettera reproduction, which is superior quality Swiss printing on two
    pages of glossy paper.  The Lambert version is intermediate in quality. \r\nI
    didn't bother scanning any of the versions because the complexity meant that it
    would not be a candidate for fonting, at least not by me. Also I find the design
    to be rather clunkly and more of a curiosity than something people would actually
    use. But that's just my opinion -- perhaps a letter might work as a chapter heading
    in something like a steampunk context.\r\nDon"

    back to try and find it ... It would take forever to complete. \r\n\r\nLooked
    up the Haab Lettera and see they do show a two page spread, but it is ALSO missing
    a W -- wonder if it was the common source for Hornung and Haab?(Nick's picture
    shows one!)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lettera_5375.jpg]"
