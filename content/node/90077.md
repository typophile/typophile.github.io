  I can't seem to find a decent blog for information and inspiration in layout design
  (BLAD and MLAD). I really want to find some lovely blogs with information about
  the newest and bestest interior book design, illustrated/picture book design, magazine
  layout etc etc. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions? (Maybe I'm not looking hard enough). "

    enough\u2026\r\nNot always easy to spend the time riffling through bookstores
    when you've got deadlines to meet though! Life as a book designer is unfortunately
    not always that easy\u2026!"
